Matt
Reynolds
and
Sabrina
WeissOn
December
31
,
2019
,
the
World
Health
Organisation
’
s
(
WHO
)
China
office
heard
the
first
reports
of
a
previously-unknown
virus
behind
a
number
of
pneumonia
cases
in
Wuhan
,
a
city
in
Eastern
China
with
a
population
of
over
11
million.What
started
as
an
epidemic
mainly
limited
to
China
has
now
become
a
truly
global
pandemic
.
There
have
now
been
over
5,595,091
confirmed
cases
and
350,547
deaths
,
according
the
John
Hopkins
University
Covid-19
dashboard
,
which
collates
information
from
national
and
international
health
authorities
.
The
disease
has
been
detected
in
more
than
200
countries
and
territories
,
with
the
US
,
Brazil
and
Russia
experiencing
the
most
widespread
outbreaks
,
followed
by
the
UK
,
Spain
and
Italy
.
In
the
UK
,
there
have
been
265,227
confirmed
cases
and
37,048
deaths
as
of
May
26
.
The
true
number
of
infections
and
deaths
is
likely
to
be
considerably
higher.The
Chinese
government
responded
to
the
initial
outbreak
by
placing
Wuhan
and
nearby
cities
under
a
de-facto
quarantine
encompassing
roughly
50
million
people
in
Hubei
province
.
This
quarantine
is
now
slowly
being
lifted
,
as
authorities
watch
to
see
whether
cases
will
rise
again
.
The
US
is
now
the
new
epicentre
of
the
Covid-19
outbreak
.
As
of
May
27
,
the
country
has
1,681,418
confirmed
infections
and
98,929
deaths
.
In
Italy
,
where
the
death
toll
surpassed
that
of
China
on
March
19
,
the
government
took
the
unprecedented
step
of
extending
a
lockdown
to
the
entire
country
,
shutting
cinemas
,
theatres
,
gyms
,
discos
and
pubs
and
banning
funerals
and
weddings
.
In
the
UK
,
the
government
has
shut
schools
,
pubs
,
restaurants
,
bars
,
cafés
and
all
non-essential
shops
for
at
least
nine
weeks
.
On
May
10
Boris
Johnson
outlined
a
flexible
plan
that
would
see
some
schools
reopen
by
June
depending
on
the
current
threat
posed
to
the
UK
by
the
virus.On
March
23
,
prime
minister
Boris
Johnson
put
the
UK
under
lockdown
saying
that
police
will
now
have
the
power
to
fine
people
who
gather
in
groups
of
more
than
two
or
who
are
outside
for
non-essential
reasons
.
People
with
the
main
coronavirus
symptoms
–
a
fever
or
dry
cough
–
are
required
to
stay
at
home
for
seven
days
while
households
in
which
at
least
one
person
is
displaying
symptoms
should
quarantine
themselves
for
14
days
.
Four
days
later
the
prime
minister
and
health
secretary
Matt
Hancock
both
tested
positive
for
the
virus
–
Johnson
spent
three
nights
in
intensive
care
and
then
stayed
at
the
prime
minister
's
country
residence
,
Chequers
to
recover
.
He
returned
to
work
at
Downing
Street
on
the
morning
of
April
27.On
March
11
the
WHO
officially
declared
the
Covid-19
outbreak
a
pandemic
.
``
WHO
has
been
assessing
this
outbreak
around
the
clock
and
we
are
deeply
concerned
both
by
the
alarming
levels
of
spread
and
severity
,
and
by
the
alarming
levels
of
inaction
,
''
said
its
director-general
Tedros
Adhanom
Ghebreyesus
.
Although
the
WHO
designated
Covid-19
a
``
public
health
emergency
of
international
concern
''
(
PHEIC
)
on
January
30
,
it
had
been
reluctant
to
call
it
a
pandemic
.
``
Pandemic
is
not
a
word
to
use
lightly
or
carelessly
.
It
is
a
word
that
,
if
misused
,
can
cause
unreasonable
fear
,
or
unjustified
acceptance
that
the
fight
is
over
,
leading
to
unnecessary
suffering
and
death
,
''
Adhanom
said.A
quick
note
on
naming
.
Although
popularly
referred
to
as
coronavirus
,
on
February
11
,
the
WHO
announced
the
official
name
of
the
disease
:
Covid-19
.
The
virus
that
causes
that
disease
is
called
Severe
Acute
Respiratory
Syndrome
Coronavirus
2
,
or
Sars-CoV-2
for
short.The
disease
appears
to
have
originated
from
a
Wuhan
seafood
market
where
wild
animals
,
including
marmots
,
birds
,
rabbits
,
bats
and
snakes
,
are
traded
illegally
.
Coronaviruses
are
known
to
jump
from
animals
to
humans
,
so
it
’
s
thought
that
the
first
people
infected
with
the
disease
–
a
group
primarily
made
up
of
stallholders
from
the
seafood
market
–
contracted
it
from
contact
with
animals.The
hunt
for
the
animal
source
of
Covid-19
is
still
unknown
,
although
there
are
some
strong
contenders
.
A
team
of
virologists
at
the
Wuhan
Institute
for
Virology
released
a
detailed
paper
showing
that
the
new
coronaviruses
'
genetic
makeup
is
96
per
cent
identical
to
that
of
a
coronavirus
found
in
bats
,
while
a
study
published
on
March
26
argues
that
genetic
sequences
of
coronavirus
in
pangolins
are
between
88.5
and
92.4
per
cent
similar
to
the
human
virus
.
Some
early
cases
of
Covid-19
,
however
,
appear
to
have
inflicted
people
with
no
link
to
the
Wuhan
market
at
all
,
suggesting
that
the
initial
route
of
human
infection
may
pre-date
the
market
cases.The
Wuhan
market
was
shut
down
for
inspection
and
cleaning
on
January
1
,
but
by
then
it
appears
that
Covid-19
was
already
starting
to
spread
beyond
the
market
itself
.
On
January
21
,
the
WHO
Western
Pacific
office
said
the
disease
was
also
being
transmitted
between
humans
–
evidence
of
which
is
apparent
after
medical
staff
became
infected
with
the
virus.Coronaviruses
are
a
large
group
of
viruses
that
are
known
to
infect
both
humans
and
animals
,
and
in
humans
cause
respiratory
illness
that
range
from
common
colds
to
much
more
serious
infections
.
The
most
well-known
case
of
a
coronavirus
epidemic
was
Severe
Acute
Respiratory
Syndrome
(
Sars
)
,
which
,
after
first
being
detected
in
southern
China
in
2002
,
went
on
to
affect
26
countries
and
resulted
in
more
than
8,000
cases
and
774
deaths.While
the
cause
of
the
current
outbreak
was
initially
unknown
,
on
January
7
Chinese
health
authorities
identified
that
it
was
caused
by
to
a
strain
of
coronavirus
that
hadn
’
t
been
encountered
in
humans
before
.
Five
days
later
the
Chinese
government
shared
the
genetic
sequence
of
the
virus
so
that
other
countries
could
develop
their
own
diagnostic
kits
.
That
virus
is
now
called
Sars-CoV-2.Although
symptoms
of
coronaviruses
are
often
mild
–
the
most
common
symptoms
are
a
fever
and
dry
cough
–
in
some
cases
they
lead
to
more
serious
respiratory
tract
illness
including
pneumonia
and
bronchitis
.
These
can
be
particularly
dangerous
in
older
patients
,
or
people
who
have
existing
health
conditions
,
and
this
appears
to
be
the
case
with
Covid-19
.
A
study
of
44,415
early
Chinese
Covid-19
patients
found
that
81
per
cent
of
people
with
confirmed
infections
experienced
only
mild
symptoms
.
Of
the
remaining
cases
,
14
per
cent
were
in
a
severe
condition
while
five
per
cent
of
people
were
critical
cases
,
suffering
from
respiratory
failure
,
septic
shock
or
multiple
organ
failure
.
In
the
Chinese
study
,
2.3
per
cent
of
all
confirmed
cases
died
,
although
the
actual
death
rate
is
probably
much
lower
as
many
more
people
will
have
been
infected
with
the
virus
than
tested
positive.China
felt
the
initial
brunt
of
the
Covid-19
epidemic
.
At
the
peak
of
its
outbreak
in
mid-February
,
the
country
saw
more
than
5,000
cases
in
a
single
day
.
As
of
May
27
,
Chinese
health
authorities
had
acknowledged
over
84,103
cases
and
4,638
deaths
–
most
of
them
within
the
province
of
Hubei
.
Since
March
,
however
,
the
country
has
seen
a
remarkable
slowdown
.
On
March
17
,
China
recorded
just
39
new
cases
of
the
virus
.
Most
of
the
country
's
new
cases
are
imported
from
elsewhere
in
the
world
–
for
now
at
least
,
it
appears
that
China
has
its
outbreak
under
control.But
while
things
were
slowing
down
in
China
,
the
outbreak
started
picking
up
in
the
rest
of
the
world
.
There
are
now
confirmed
cases
in
at
least
200
countries
and
territories
.
The
US
has
seen
the
highest
number
of
cases
.
The
country
–
which
has
been
criticised
for
its
slow
rollout
of
testing
and
confused
approach
to
the
crisis
–
now
has
1,681,418
confirmed
infections
and
98,929
deaths
.
With
370,680
confirmed
cases
and
3,807
deaths
,
Russia
's
mortality
rate
appears
to
be
particularly
low
.
The
true
death
toll
may
be
underreported
because
the
country
's
statistics
only
include
the
deaths
of
people
directly
attributed
to
Covid-19.After
the
UK
,
Italy
has
seen
the
highest
number
of
deaths
in
Europe
,
with
32,955
deaths
and
230,555
confirmed
infections
,
mostly
in
the
north
of
the
country
.
The
country
has
had
the
longest-running
lockdown
of
any
country
and
on
May
4
started
to
ease
its
restrictions
for
the
first
time
after
nine
weeks.Spain
is
also
in
the
grip
of
a
significant
outbreak
.
The
country
has
236,259
confirmed
infections
and
27,117
deaths
.
There
,
citizens
are
under
lockdown
,
with
the
government
shutting
all
schools
,
bars
,
restaurants
and
non-essential
supermarkets
down
.
People
are
only
allowed
to
leave
their
homes
to
buy
food
or
to
go
to
work
.
Germany
has
181,200
confirmed
cases
and
8,386
deaths
,
a
rate
lower
than
many
other
European
countries
.
Social
distancing
rules
stayed
in
place
until
May
4
,
but
the
country
is
slowly
relaxing
its
requirements
with
shops
and
schools
starting
to
re-open
their
doors
.
Austria
,
which
has
16,557
confirmed
cases
and
643
deaths
was
the
first
European
country
to
partially
lift
its
lockdown
on
April
14.While
the
number
of
new
cases
continues
to
rise
sharply
,
people
are
also
recovering
from
the
infection
.
Globally
,
2,288,965
people
have
recovered
from
Covid-19
–
about
41
per
cent
of
all
of
the
people
who
had
confirmed
infections
,
although
the
true
number
of
coronavirus
cases
will
be
much
higher.As
of
May
26
,
the
UK
has
reported
265,227
confirmed
Covid-19
infections
and
37,048
deaths
–
the
highest
death
toll
in
Europe
.
In
total
,
2,064,329
people
have
been
tested
for
the
disease
.
On
March
16
,
prime
minister
Boris
Johnson
led
the
first
daily
coronavirus
press
conference
,
saying
that
the
government
now
advised
all
UK
residents
to
avoid
non-essential
social
contact
and
travel
where
possible
.
On
Friday
March
20
this
was
extended
to
include
a
shutdown
of
all
bars
,
pubs
,
cafés
and
restaurants
in
the
UK
.
From
the
same
day
all
schools
in
England
,
Scotland
and
Wales
were
shut
until
further
notice
.
Only
vulnerable
children
,
or
those
who
are
the
sons
and
daughters
of
employees
in
the
NHS
or
other
key
industries
,
will
be
permitted
to
remain
at
school
.
Transport
for
London
is
currently
running
a
reduced
tube
,
bus
and
rail
service
meant
only
for
key
workers
and
has
seen
an
80
per
cent
reduction
in
passenger
numbers
since
February
27.On
March
23
–
after
a
weekend
where
many
seemed
to
flout
the
social
distancing
recommendations
–
the
prime
minister
announced
a
ratcheting-up
of
the
UK
's
coronavirus
policies
.
Now
,
people
are
only
allowed
to
leave
their
homes
for
essential
work
,
for
food
or
medical
supplies
,
to
care
for
a
vulnerable
person
or
to
exercise
.
Police
will
have
the
ability
to
fine
those
who
do
not
comply
with
the
new
rules
,
the
prime
minister
said
in
his
address
to
the
nation
.
The
government
also
asked
UK
mobile
networks
to
send
a
message
to
everyone
in
the
UK
instructing
them
that
they
must
stay
at
home.People
who
currently
live
alone
are
recommended
to
self-isolate
for
seven
days
if
they
develop
a
fever
or
persistent
dry
cough
–
the
two
most
common
symptoms
of
coronavirus
.
For
families
and
other
people
who
live
together
,
the
advice
is
that
the
entire
household
should
self-isolate
if
any
member
develops
either
of
those
symptoms
.
This
strategy
is
part
of
the
government
's
'delay
phase
'
plan
to
flatten
the
peak
of
the
virus
and
reduce
the
burden
on
the
NHS.A
key
part
of
this
plan
is
shielding
those
who
are
most
vulnerable
to
Covid-19
:
people
older
than
70
,
or
those
who
have
underlying
health
conditions
.
The
NHS
has
identified
the
1.5
million
people
most
vulnerable
and
sent
them
letters
instructing
them
to
self-isolate
for
12
weeks
.
These
people
are
being
asked
not
to
leave
their
houses
under
any
circumstances
,
to
minimise
all
face-to-face
contact
and
for
all
deliveries
of
food
and
medication
to
be
left
at
their
doorsteps.Although
the
prime
minister
said
that
this
shielding
may
last
as
long
as
12
weeks
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
peak
of
the
outbreak
has
passed
,
modelling
from
Imperial
College
London
suggests
that
these
measures
may
have
to
be
in
place
for
as
long
as
18
months
.
On
May
10
prime
minister
Boris
Johnson
announced
that
the
UK
lockdown
would
be
in
place
until
at
least
June
when
some
shops
and
schools
will
be
allowed
to
re-open.Despite
these
measures
,
some
have
been
critical
that
the
government
's
stance
does
n't
go
far
enough
.
Italy
and
Spain
both
had
in
place
even
more
restrictive
lockdowns
,
while
South
Korea
has
rolled-out
extremely
comprehensive
testing
for
many
of
its
population
.
The
government
has
also
been
ramping
up
antibody
tests
which
should
eventually
be
able
to
detect
who
has
been
previously
exposed
to
the
virus
,
although
there
are
serious
doubts
over
the
accuracy
of
the
currently
available
tests
.
The
first
1,000
samples
suggest
17
per
cent
of
adults
in
London
and
around
5
per
cent
across
England
have
coronavirus
antibodies.Covid-19
shares
many
of
its
symptoms
with
the
flu
or
common
cold
,
although
there
are
certain
symptoms
common
to
flu
and
colds
that
are
not
usually
seen
in
Covid-19
.
People
with
confirmed
cases
of
Covid-19
rarely
suffer
from
a
runny
nose
,
for
instance.The
most
common
Covid-19
symptoms
are
a
fever
and
a
dry
cough
.
Of
55,924
early
Chinese
cases
of
the
disease
,
nearly
90
per
cent
of
patients
experienced
a
fever
and
just
over
two-thirds
suffered
with
a
dry
cough
.
That
’
s
why
the
UK
government
is
advising
anyone
with
a
high
temperature
or
a
new
,
continuous
cough
to
stay
at
home
for
seven
days
or
,
if
they
live
with
other
people
,
for
the
entire
household
to
isolate
for
14
days
from
the
first
onset
of
symptoms.Other
Covid-19
symptoms
are
less
common
.
Just
under
40
per
cent
of
people
with
the
disease
experience
fatigue
,
while
a
third
of
people
cough
up
sputum
–
a
thick
mucus
from
within
the
lungs
.
Other
rarer
symptoms
include
shortness
of
breath
,
muscle
pain
,
sore
throats
,
headaches
or
chills
,
loss
of
smell
or
taste
.
According
to
the
WHO
,
symptoms
tend
to
appear
between
five
and
six
days
after
infection.A
vaccine
for
Covid-19
isn
’
t
around
the
corner
.
Bringing
vaccines
to
the
market
is
a
notoriously
slow
process
and
any
potential
vaccine
will
have
to
pass
multiple
stages
of
testing
for
safety
and
effectiveness
.
And
once
we
know
a
vaccine
is
safe
,
we
will
also
need
to
manufacture
it
at
a
scale
high
enough
to
use
across
the
world
.
It
’
s
likely
that
any
vaccine
is
around
18
months
away.That
said
,
there
is
lots
of
work
being
done
to
develop
a
vaccine
for
Covid-19
.
The
pharmaceutical
firm
Sanofi
is
trying
to
build
on
its
already-approved
flu
vaccine
and
turn
it
into
something
suitable
to
treat
Covid-19
.
Other
approaches
–
such
as
one
being
trialled
by
the
University
of
Oxford
–
are
focusing
on
the
external
spike
proteins
on
the
Covid-19
virus
as
a
way
to
target
vaccines.But
accelerating
these
efforts
will
require
funding
.
The
Coalition
for
Epidemic
Preparedness
Innovations
(
CEPI
)
has
called
for
$
2
billion
in
funding
to
support
the
development
of
new
coronavirus
vaccines.As
the
number
of
daily
infections
and
deaths
has
plateaued
in
many
places
,
European
countries
are
taking
tentative
steps
to
ease
their
lockdown
measures
with
varying
approaches.Italy
's
daily
coronavirus
death
toll
is
at
its
lowest
since
March
14
and
since
May
4
,
citizens
are
allowed
to
visit
their
relatives
in
small
numbers
.
Factories
and
construction
sites
are
allowed
to
reopen
,
but
schools
will
remain
closed
until
September
.
From
June
3
,
the
country
will
also
be
welcoming
tourists
back
in
the
country
.
In
Spain
,
citizens
are
allowed
to
exercise
and
walk
outdoors
,
and
since
May
25
,
restaurants
,
bars
,
shopping
malls
,
museums
,
and
places
of
worship
are
starting
to
re-open
at
30
to
50
per
cent
capacity
.
Borders
will
remain
closed
to
foreign
tourists
until
July.The
UK
will
remain
on
lockdown
until
at
least
June
1
,
however
,
prime
minister
Boris
Johnson
announced
on
May
10
that
construction
and
manufacturing
workers
in
England
should
start
returning
to
work
.
If
the
reproduction
number
remains
below
1
,
he
said
,
the
country
might
be
in
a
position
to
begin
the
phased
re-opening
of
shops
and
get
primary
pupils
back
into
schools
in
June
.
Some
cafes
and
restaurants
with
outdoor
space
,
places
of
worship
,
theatres
and
cinemas
might
open
their
doors
again
from
July
with
extra
hygiene
and
social
distancing
measures.In
order
to
prevent
a
deadly
second
wave
of
infections
,
the
UK
and
its
European
neighbours
are
ramping
up
testing
in
the
wider
community
.
The
UK
Department
of
Health
and
Social
Care
will
contact
20,000
households
in
England
and
invite
them
to
take
part
in
an
initial
study
to
track
coronavirus
transmission
.
All
participants
will
receive
a
nose
and
throat
swab
to
test
for
whether
or
not
they
currently
have
the
virus
and
adults
in
some
1,000
of
the
households
will
provide
monthly
blood
samples
to
find
out
what
proportion
of
the
population
has
developed
antibodies
to
Covid-19
.
The
study
is
set
to
be
extended
to
300,000
people
over
the
next
12
months.Work
on
contact
tracing
apps
is
also
underway
in
the
UK
.
But
unlike
in
countries
like
South
Korea
and
China
,
which
use
a
combination
of
CCTV
,
credit
card
data
and
geolocation
information
,
the
UK
's
app
will
rely
on
the
short-range
wireless
technology
Bluetooth
to
trace
people
's
location
.
The
idea
is
that
when
a
person
has
crossed
paths
with
someone
who
has
tested
positive
for
coronavirus
,
the
app
can
be
instantly
alert
them
and
let
them
request
a
test.Matt

2021.Marr
is
an
aerosol
scientist
at
Virginia
Tech
and
one
of
the
few
in
the
world
who
also
studies
infectious
diseases
.
To
her
,
the
new
coronavirus
looked
as
if
it
could
hang
in
the
air
,
infecting
anyone
who
breathed
in
enough
of
it
.
For
people
indoors
,
that
posed
a
considerable
risk
.
But
the
WHO
didn
’
t
seem
to
have
caught
on
.
Just
days
before
,
the
organization
had
tweeted
“
FACT
:
#
COVID19
is
NOT
airborne.
”
That
’
s
why
Marr
was
skipping
her
usual
morning
workout
to
join
35
other
aerosol
scientists
.
They
were
trying
to
warn
the
WHO
it
was
making
a
big
mistake.Over
Zoom
,
they
laid
out
the
case
.
They
ticked
through
a
growing
list
of
superspreading
events
in
restaurants
,
call
centers
,
cruise
ships
,
and
a
choir
rehearsal
,
instances
where
people
got
sick
even
when
they
were
across
the
room
from
a
contagious
person
.
The
incidents
contradicted
the
WHO
’
s
main
safety
guidelines
of
keeping
3
to
6
feet
of
distance
between
people
and
frequent
handwashing
.
If
SARS-CoV-2
traveled
only
in
large
droplets
that
immediately
fell
to
the
ground
,
as
the
WHO
was
saying
,
then
wouldn
’
t
the
distancing
and
the
handwashing
have
prevented
such
outbreaks
?
Infectious
air
was
the
more
likely
culprit
,
they
argued
.
But
the
WHO
’
s
experts
appeared
to
be
unmoved
.
If
they
were
going
to
call
Covid-19
airborne
,
they
wanted
more
direct
evidence—proof
,
which
could
take
months
to
gather
,
that
the
virus
was
abundant
in
the
air
.
Meanwhile
,
thousands
of
people
were
falling
ill
every
day.On
the
video
call
,
tensions
rose
.
At
one
point
,
Lidia
Morawska
,
a
revered
atmospheric
physicist
who
had
arranged
the
meeting
,
tried
to
explain
how
far
infectious
particles
of
different
sizes
could
potentially
travel
.
One
of
the
WHO
experts
abruptly
cut
her
off
,
telling
her
she
was
wrong
,
Marr
recalls
.
His
rudeness
shocked
her
.
“
You
just
don
’
t
argue
with
Lidia
about
physics
,
”
she
says.Morawska
had
spent
more
than
two
decades
advising
a
different
branch
of
the
WHO
on
the
impacts
of
air
pollution
.
When
it
came
to
flecks
of
soot
and
ash
belched
out
by
smokestacks
and
tailpipes
,
the
organization
readily
accepted
the
physics
she
was
describing—that
particles
of
many
sizes
can
hang
aloft
,
travel
far
,
and
be
inhaled
.
Now
,
though
,
the
WHO
’
s
advisers
seemed
to
be
saying
those
same
laws
didn
’
t
apply
to
virus-laced
respiratory
particles
.
To
them
,
the
word
airborne
only
applied
to
particles
smaller
than
5
microns
.
Trapped
in
their
group-specific
jargon
,
the
two
camps
on
Zoom
literally
couldn
’
t
understand
one
another.When
the
call
ended
,
Marr
sat
back
heavily
,
feeling
an
old
frustration
coiling
tighter
in
her
body
.
She
itched
to
go
for
a
run
,
to
pound
it
out
footfall
by
footfall
into
the
pavement
.
“
It
felt
like
they
had
already
made
up
their
minds
and
they
were
just
entertaining
us
,
”
she
recalls
.
Marr
was
no
stranger
to
being
ignored
by
members
of
the
medical
establishment
.
Often
seen
as
an
epistemic
trespasser
,
she
was
used
to
persevering
through
skepticism
and
outright
rejection
.
This
time
,
however
,
so
much
more
than
her
ego
was
at
stake
.
The
beginning
of
a
global
pandemic
was
a
terrible
time
to
get
into
a
fight
over
words
.
But
she
had
an
inkling
that
the
verbal
sparring
was
a
symptom
of
a
bigger
problem—that
outdated
science
was
underpinning
public
health
policy
.
She
had
to
get
through
to
them
.
But
first
,
she
had
to
crack
the
mystery
of
why
their
communication
was
failing
so
badly
.
Marr
spent
the
first
many
years
of
her
career
studying
air
pollution
,
just
as
Morawska
had
.
But
her
priorities
began
to
change
in
the
late
2000s
,
when
Marr
sent
her
oldest
child
off
to
day
care
.
That
winter
,
she
noticed
how
waves
of
runny
noses
,
chest
colds
,
and
flu
swept
through
the
classrooms
,
despite
the
staff
’
s
rigorous
disinfection
routines
.
“
Could
these
common
infections
actually
be
in
the
air
?
”
she
wondered
.
Marr
picked
up
a
few
introductory
medical
textbooks
to
satisfy
her
curiosity
.
According
to
the
medical
canon
,
nearly
all
respiratory
infections
transmit
through
coughs
or
sneezes
:
Whenever
a
sick
person
hacks
,
bacteria
and
viruses
spray
out
like
bullets
from
a
gun
,
quickly
falling
and
sticking
to
any
surface
within
a
blast
radius
of
3
to
6
feet
.
If
these
droplets
alight
on
a
nose
or
mouth
(
or
on
a
hand
that
then
touches
the
face
)
,
they
can
cause
an
infection
.
Only
a
few
diseases
were
thought
to
break
this
droplet
rule
.
Measles
and
tuberculosis
transmit
a
different
way
;
they
’
re
described
as
“
airborne.
”
Those
pathogens
travel
inside
aerosols
,
microscopic
particles
that
can
stay
suspended
for
hours
and
travel
longer
distances
.
They
can
spread
when
contagious
people
simply
breathe.The
distinction
between
droplet
and
airborne
transmission
has
enormous
consequences
.
To
combat
droplets
,
a
leading
precaution
is
to
wash
hands
frequently
with
soap
and
water
.
To
fight
infectious
aerosols
,
the
air
itself
is
the
enemy
.
In
hospitals
,
that
means
expensive
isolation
wards
and
N95
masks
for
all
medical
staff.The
books
Marr
flipped
through
drew
the
line
between
droplets
and
aerosols
at
5
microns
.
A
micron
is
a
unit
of
measurement
equal
to
one-millionth
of
a
meter
.
By
this
definition
,
any
infectious
particle
smaller
than
5
microns
in
diameter
is
an
aerosol
;
anything
bigger
is
a
droplet
.
The
more
she
looked
,
the
more
she
found
that
number
.
The
WHO
and
the
US
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
also
listed
5
microns
as
the
fulcrum
on
which
the
droplet-aerosol
dichotomy
toggled.There
was
just
one
literally
tiny
problem
:
“
The
physics
of
it
is
all
wrong
,
”
Marr
says
.
That
much
seemed
obvious
to
her
from
everything
she
knew
about
how
things
move
through
air
.
Reality
is
far
messier
,
with
particles
much
larger
than
5
microns
staying
afloat
and
behaving
like
aerosols
,
depending
on
heat
,
humidity
,
and
airspeed
.
“
I
’
d
see
the
wrong
number
over
and
over
again
,
and
I
just
found
that
disturbing
,
”
she
says
.
The
error
meant
that
the
medical
community
had
a
distorted
picture
of
how
people
might
get
sick
.
Epidemiologists
have
long
observed
that
most
respiratory
bugs
require
close
contact
to
spread
.
Yet
in
that
small
space
,
a
lot
can
happen
.
A
sick
person
might
cough
droplets
onto
your
face
,
emit
small
aerosols
that
you
inhale
,
or
shake
your
hand
,
which
you
then
use
to
rub
your
nose
.
Any
one
of
those
mechanisms
might
transmit
the
virus
.
“
Technically
,
it
’
s
very
hard
to
separate
them
and
see
which
one
is
causing
the
infection
,
”
Marr
says
.
For
long-distance
infections
,
only
the
smallest
particles
could
be
to
blame
.
Up
close
,
though
,
particles
of
all
sizes
were
in
play
.
Yet
,
for
decades
,
droplets
were
seen
as
the
main
culprit.Marr
decided
to
collect
some
data
of
her
own
.
Installing
air
samplers
in
places
such
as
day
cares
and
airplanes
,
she
frequently
found
the
flu
virus
where
the
textbooks
said
it
shouldn
’
t
be—hiding
in
the
air
,
most
often
in
particles
small
enough
to
stay
aloft
for
hours
.
And
there
was
enough
of
it
to
make
people
sick.In
2011
,
this
should
have
been
major
news
.
Instead
,
the
major
medical
journals
rejected
her
manuscript
.
Even
as
she
ran
new
experiments
that
added
evidence
to
the
idea
that
influenza
was
infecting
people
via
aerosols
,
only
one
niche
publisher
,
The
Journal
of
the
Royal
Society
Interface
,
was
consistently
receptive
to
her
work
.
In
the
siloed
world
of
academia
,
aerosols
had
always
been
the
domain
of
engineers
and
physicists
,
and
pathogens
purely
a
medical
concern
;
Marr
was
one
of
the
rare
people
who
tried
to
straddle
the
divide
.
“
I
was
definitely
fringe
,
”
she
says.Thinking
it
might
help
her
overcome
this
resistance
,
she
’
d
try
from
time
to
time
to
figure
out
where
the
flawed
5-micron
figure
had
come
from
.
But
she
always
got
stuck
.
The
medical
textbooks
simply
stated
it
as
fact
,
without
a
citation
,
as
if
it
were
pulled
from
the
air
itself
.
Eventually
she
got
tired
of
trying
,
her
research
and
life
moved
on
,
and
the
5-micron
mystery
faded
into
the
background
.
Until
,
that
is
,
December
2019
,
when
a
paper
crossed
her
desk
from
the
lab
of
Yuguo
Li.An
indoor-air
researcher
at
the
University
of
Hong
Kong
,
Li
had
made
a
name
for
himself
during
the
first
SARS
outbreak
,
in
2003
.
His
investigation
of
an
outbreak
at
the
Amoy
Gardens
apartment
complex
provided
the
strongest
evidence
that
a
coronavirus
could
be
airborne
.
But
in
the
intervening
decades
,
he
’
d
also
struggled
to
convince
the
public
health
community
that
their
risk
calculus
was
off
.
Eventually
,
he
decided
to
work
out
the
math
.
Li
’
s
elegant
simulations
showed
that
when
a
person
coughed
or
sneezed
,
the
heavy
droplets
were
too
few
and
the
targets—an
open
mouth
,
nostrils
,
eyes—too
small
to
account
for
much
infection
.
Li
’
s
team
had
concluded
,
therefore
,
that
the
public
health
establishment
had
it
backward
and
that
most
colds
,
flu
,
and
other
respiratory
illnesses
must
spread
through
aerosols
instead
.
Their
findings
,
they
argued
,
exposed
the
fallacy
of
the
5-micron
boundary
.
And
they
’
d
gone
a
step
further
,
tracing
the
number
back
to
a
decades-old
document
the
CDC
had
published
for
hospitals
.
Marr
couldn
’
t
help
but
feel
a
surge
of
excitement
.
A
journal
had
asked
her
to
review
Li
’
s
paper
,
and
she
didn
’
t
mask
her
feelings
as
she
sketched
out
her
reply
.
On
January
22
,
2020
,
she
wrote
,
“
This
work
is
hugely
important
in
challenging
the
existing
dogma
about
how
infectious
disease
is
transmitted
in
droplets
and
aerosols.
”
Even
as
she
composed
her
note
,
the
implications
of
Li
’
s
work
were
far
from
theoretical
.
Hours
later
,
Chinese
government
officials
cut
off
any
travel
in
and
out
of
the
city
of
Wuhan
,
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
contain
an
as-yet-unnamed
respiratory
disease
burning
through
the
11-million-person
megalopolis
.
As
the
pandemic
shut
down
country
after
country
,
the
WHO
and
the
CDC
told
people
to
wash
their
hands
,
scrub
surfaces
,
and
maintain
social
distance
.
They
didn
’
t
say
anything
about
masks
or
the
dangers
of
being
indoors
.
A
few
days
after
the
April
Zoom
meeting
with
the
WHO
,
Marr
got
an
email
from
another
aerosol
scientist
who
had
been
on
the
call
,
an
atmospheric
chemist
at
the
University
of
Colorado
Boulder
named
Jose-Luis
Jimenez
.
He
’
d
become
fixated
on
the
WHO
recommendation
that
people
stay
3
to
6
feet
apart
from
one
another
.
As
far
as
he
could
tell
,
that
social
distancing
guideline
seemed
to
be
based
on
a
few
studies
from
the
1930s
and
’
40s
.
But
the
authors
of
those
experiments
actually
argued
for
the
possibility
of
airborne
transmission
,
which
by
definition
would
involve
distances
over
6
feet
.
None
of
it
seemed
to
add
up
.
Marr
told
him
about
her
concerns
with
the
5-micron
boundary
and
suggested
that
their
two
issues
might
be
linked
.
If
the
6-foot
guideline
was
built
off
of
an
incorrect
definition
of
droplets
,
the
5-micron
error
wasn
’
t
just
some
arcane
detail
.
It
seemed
to
sit
at
the
heart
of
the
WHO
’
s
and
the
CDC
’
s
flawed
guidance
.
Finding
its
origin
suddenly
became
a
priority
.
But
to
hunt
it
down
,
Marr
,
Jimenez
,
and
their
collaborators
needed
help
.
They
needed
a
historian.Luckily
,
Marr
knew
one
,
a
Virginia
Tech
scholar
named
Tom
Ewing
who
specialized
in
the
history
of
tuberculosis
and
influenza
.
They
talked
.
He
suggested
they
bring
on
board
a
graduate
student
he
happened
to
know
who
was
good
at
this
particular
form
of
forensics
.
The
team
agreed
.
“
This
will
be
very
interesting
,
”
Marr
wrote
in
an
email
to
Jimenez
on
April
13
.
“
I
think
we
’
re
going
to
find
a
house
of
cards.
”
The
graduate
student
in
question
was
Katie
Randall
.
Covid
had
just
dealt
her
dissertation
a
big
blow—she
could
no
longer
conduct
in-person
research
,
so
she
’
d
promised
her
adviser
she
would
devote
the
spring
to
sorting
out
her
dissertation
and
nothing
else
.
But
then
an
email
from
Ewing
arrived
in
her
inbox
describing
Marr
’
s
quest
and
the
clues
her
team
had
so
far
unearthed
,
which
were
“
layered
like
an
archaeology
site
,
with
shards
that
might
make
up
a
pot
,
”
he
wrote
.
That
did
it
.
She
was
in.Randall
had
studied
citation
tracking
,
a
type
of
scholastic
detective
work
where
the
clues
aren
’
t
blood
sprays
and
stray
fibers
but
buried
references
to
long-ago
studies
,
reports
,
and
other
records
.
She
started
digging
where
Li
and
the
others
had
left
off—with
various
WHO
and
CDC
papers
.
But
she
didn
’
t
find
any
more
clues
than
they
had
.
Dead
end.She
tried
another
tack
.
Everyone
agreed
that
tuberculosis
was
airborne
.
So
she
plugged
“
5
microns
”
and
“
tuberculosis
”
into
a
search
of
the
CDC
’
s
archives
.
She
scrolled
and
scrolled
until
she
reached
the
earliest
document
on
tuberculosis
prevention
that
mentioned
aerosol
size
.
It
cited
an
out-of-print
book
written
by
a
Harvard
engineer
named
William
Firth
Wells
.
Published
in
1955
,
it
was
called
Airborne
Contagion
and
Air
Hygiene
.
A
lead
!
In
the
Before
Times
,
she
would
have
acquired
the
book
through
interlibrary
loan
.
With
the
pandemic
shutting
down
universities
,
that
was
no
longer
an
option
.
On
the
wilds
of
the
open
internet
,
Randall
tracked
down
a
first
edition
from
a
rare
book
seller
for
$
500—a
hefty
expense
for
a
side
project
with
essentially
no
funding
.
But
then
one
of
the
university
’
s
librarians
came
through
and
located
a
digital
copy
in
Michigan
.
Randall
began
to
dig
in.In
the
words
of
Wells
’
manuscript
,
she
found
a
man
at
the
end
of
his
career
,
rushing
to
contextualize
more
than
23
years
of
research
.
She
started
reading
his
early
work
,
including
one
of
the
studies
Jimenez
had
mentioned
.
In
1934
,
Wells
and
his
wife
,
Mildred
Weeks
Wells
,
a
physician
,
analyzed
air
samples
and
plotted
a
curve
showing
how
the
opposing
forces
of
gravity
and
evaporation
acted
on
respiratory
particles
.
The
couple
’
s
calculations
made
it
possible
to
predict
the
time
it
would
take
a
particle
of
a
given
size
to
travel
from
someone
’
s
mouth
to
the
ground
.
According
to
them
,
particles
bigger
than
100
microns
sank
within
seconds
.
Smaller
particles
stayed
in
the
air
.
Randall
paused
at
the
curve
they
’
d
drawn
.
To
her
,
it
seemed
to
foreshadow
the
idea
of
a
droplet-aerosol
dichotomy
,
but
one
that
should
have
pivoted
around
100
microns
,
not
5
.
The
book
was
long
,
more
than
400
pages
,
and
Randall
was
still
on
the
hook
for
her
dissertation
.
She
was
also
helping
her
restless
6-year-old
daughter
navigate
remote
kindergarten
,
now
that
Covid
had
closed
her
school
.
So
it
was
often
not
until
late
at
night
,
after
everyone
had
gone
to
bed
,
that
she
could
return
to
it
,
taking
detailed
notes
about
each
day
’
s
progress.One
night
she
read
about
experiments
Wells
did
in
the
1940s
in
which
he
installed
air-disinfecting
ultraviolet
lights
inside
schools
.
In
the
classrooms
with
UV
lamps
installed
,
fewer
kids
came
down
with
the
measles
.
He
concluded
that
the
measles
virus
must
have
been
in
the
air
.
Randall
was
struck
by
this
.
She
knew
that
measles
didn
’
t
get
recognized
as
an
airborne
disease
until
decades
later
.
What
had
happened
?
Part
of
medical
rhetoric
is
understanding
why
certain
ideas
take
hold
and
others
don
’
t
.
So
as
spring
turned
to
summer
,
Randall
started
to
investigate
how
Wells
’
contemporaries
perceived
him
.
That
’
s
how
she
found
the
writings
of
Alexander
Langmuir
,
the
influential
chief
epidemiologist
of
the
newly
established
CDC
.
Like
his
peers
,
Langmuir
had
been
brought
up
in
the
Gospel
of
Personal
Cleanliness
,
an
obsession
that
made
handwashing
the
bedrock
of
US
public
health
policy
.
He
seemed
to
view
Wells
’
ideas
about
airborne
transmission
as
retrograde
,
seeing
in
them
a
slide
back
toward
an
ancient
,
irrational
terror
of
bad
air—the
“
miasma
theory
”
that
had
prevailed
for
centuries
.
Langmuir
dismissed
them
as
little
more
than
“
interesting
theoretical
points.
”
But
at
the
same
time
,
Langmuir
was
growing
increasingly
preoccupied
by
the
threat
of
biological
warfare
.
He
worried
about
enemies
carpeting
US
cities
in
airborne
pathogens
.
In
March
1951
,
just
months
after
the
start
of
the
Korean
War
,
Langmuir
published
a
report
in
which
he
simultaneously
disparaged
Wells
’
belief
in
airborne
infection
and
credited
his
work
as
being
foundational
to
understanding
the
physics
of
airborne
infection.How
curious
,
Randall
thought
.
She
kept
reading.In
the
report
,
Langmuir
cited
a
few
studies
from
the
1940s
looking
at
the
health
hazards
of
working
in
mines
and
factories
,
which
showed
the
mucus
of
the
nose
and
throat
to
be
exceptionally
good
at
filtering
out
particles
bigger
than
5
microns
.
The
smaller
ones
,
however
,
could
slip
deep
into
the
lungs
and
cause
irreversible
damage
.
If
someone
wanted
to
turn
a
rare
and
nasty
pathogen
into
a
potent
agent
of
mass
infection
,
Langmuir
wrote
,
the
thing
to
do
would
be
to
formulate
it
into
a
liquid
that
could
be
aerosolized
into
particles
smaller
than
5
microns
,
small
enough
to
bypass
the
body
’
s
main
defenses
.
Curious
indeed
.
Randall
made
a
note.When
she
returned
to
Wells
’
book
a
few
days
later
,
she
noticed
he
too
had
written
about
those
industrial
hygiene
studies
.
They
had
inspired
Wells
to
investigate
what
role
particle
size
played
in
the
likelihood
of
natural
respiratory
infections
.
He
designed
a
study
using
tuberculosis-causing
bacteria
.
The
bug
was
hardy
and
could
be
aerosolized
,
and
if
it
landed
in
the
lungs
,
it
grew
into
a
small
lesion
.
He
exposed
rabbits
to
similar
doses
of
the
bacteria
,
pumped
into
their
chambers
either
as
a
fine
(
smaller
than
5
microns
)
or
coarse
(
bigger
than
5
microns
)
mist
.
The
animals
that
got
the
fine
treatment
fell
ill
,
and
upon
autopsy
it
was
clear
their
lungs
bulged
with
lesions
.
The
bunnies
that
received
the
coarse
blast
appeared
no
worse
for
the
wear.For
days
,
Randall
worked
like
this—going
back
and
forth
between
Wells
and
Langmuir
,
moving
forward
and
backward
in
time
.
As
she
got
into
Langmuir
’
s
later
writings
,
she
observed
a
shift
in
his
tone
.
In
articles
he
wrote
up
until
the
1980s
,
toward
the
end
of
his
career
,
he
admitted
he
had
been
wrong
about
airborne
infection
.
It
was
possible.A
big
part
of
what
changed
Langmuir
’
s
mind
was
one
of
Wells
’
final
studies
.
Working
at
a
VA
hospital
in
Baltimore
,
Wells
and
his
collaborators
had
pumped
exhaust
air
from
a
tuberculosis
ward
into
the
cages
of
about
150
guinea
pigs
on
the
building
’
s
top
floor
.
Month
after
month
,
a
few
guinea
pigs
came
down
with
tuberculosis
.
Still
,
public
health
authorities
were
skeptical
.
They
complained
that
the
experiment
lacked
controls
.
So
Wells
’
team
added
another
150
animals
,
but
this
time
they
included
UV
lights
to
kill
any
germs
in
the
air
.
Those
guinea
pigs
stayed
healthy
.
That
was
it
,
the
first
incontrovertible
evidence
that
a
human
disease—tuberculosis—could
be
airborne
,
and
not
even
the
public
health
big
hats
could
ignore
it
.
The
groundbreaking
results
were
published
in
1962
.
Wells
died
in
September
of
the
following
year
.
A
month
later
,
Langmuir
mentioned
the
late
engineer
in
a
speech
to
public
health
workers
.
It
was
Wells
,
he
said
,
that
they
had
to
thank
for
illuminating
their
inadequate
response
to
a
growing
epidemic
of
tuberculosis
.
He
emphasized
that
the
problematic
particles—the
ones
they
had
to
worry
about—were
smaller
than
5
microns.Inside
Randall
’
s
head
,
something
snapped
into
place
.
She
shot
forward
in
time
,
to
that
first
tuberculosis
guidance
document
where
she
had
started
her
investigation
.
She
had
learned
from
it
that
tuberculosis
is
a
curious
critter
;
it
can
only
invade
a
subset
of
human
cells
in
the
deepest
reaches
of
the
lungs
.
Most
bugs
are
more
promiscuous
.
They
can
embed
in
particles
of
any
size
and
infect
cells
all
along
the
respiratory
tract.What
must
have
happened
,
she
thought
,
was
that
after
Wells
died
,
scientists
inside
the
CDC
conflated
his
observations
.
They
plucked
the
size
of
the
particle
that
transmits
tuberculosis
out
of
context
,
making
5
microns
stand
in
for
a
general
definition
of
airborne
spread
.
Wells
’
100-micron
threshold
got
left
behind
.
“
You
can
see
that
the
idea
of
what
is
respirable
,
what
stays
airborne
,
and
what
is
infectious
are
all
being
flattened
into
this
5-micron
phenomenon
,
”
Randall
says
.
Over
time
,
through
blind
repetition
,
the
error
sank
deeper
into
the
medical
canon
.
The
CDC
did
not
respond
to
multiple
requests
for
comment
.
In
June
,
she
Zoomed
into
a
meeting
with
the
rest
of
the
team
to
share
what
she
had
found
.
Marr
almost
couldn
’
t
believe
someone
had
cracked
it
.
“
It
was
like
,
‘
Oh
my
gosh
,
this
is
where
the
5
microns
came
from
?
!
’
”
After
all
these
years
,
she
finally
had
an
answer
.
But
getting
to
the
bottom
of
the
5-micron
myth
was
only
the
first
step
.
Dislodging
it
from
decades
of
public
health
doctrine
would
mean
convincing
two
of
the
world
’
s
most
powerful
health
authorities
not
only
that
they
were
wrong
but
that
the
error
was
incredibly—and
urgently—consequential.While
Randall
was
digging
through
the
past
,
her
collaborators
were
planning
a
campaign
.
In
July
,
Marr
and
Jimenez
went
public
,
signing
their
names
to
an
open
letter
addressed
to
public
health
authorities
,
including
the
WHO
.
Along
with
237
other
scientists
and
physicians
,
they
warned
that
without
stronger
recommendations
for
masking
and
ventilation
,
airborne
spread
of
SARS-CoV-2
would
undermine
even
the
most
vigorous
testing
,
tracing
,
and
social
distancing
efforts
.
The
news
made
headlines
.
And
it
provoked
a
strong
backlash
.
Prominent
public
health
personalities
rushed
to
defend
the
WHO
.
Twitter
fights
ensued
.
Saskia
Popescu
,
an
infection-prevention
epidemiologist
who
is
now
a
biodefense
professor
at
George
Mason
University
,
was
willing
to
buy
the
idea
that
people
were
getting
Covid
by
breathing
in
aerosols
,
but
only
at
close
range
.
That
’
s
not
airborne
in
the
way
public
health
people
use
the
word
.
“
It
’
s
a
very
weighted
term
that
changes
how
we
approach
things
,
”
she
says
.
“
It
’
s
not
something
you
can
toss
around
haphazardly.
”
Days
later
,
the
WHO
released
an
updated
scientific
brief
,
acknowledging
that
aerosols
couldn
’
t
be
ruled
out
,
especially
in
poorly
ventilated
places
.
But
it
stuck
to
the
3-
to
6-foot
rule
,
advising
people
to
wear
masks
indoors
only
if
they
couldn
’
t
keep
that
distance
.
Jimenez
was
incensed
.
“
It
is
misinformation
,
and
it
is
making
it
difficult
for
ppl
to
protect
themselves
,
”
he
tweeted
about
the
update
.
“
E.g
.
50+
reports
of
schools
,
offices
forbidding
portable
HEPA
units
because
of
@
CDCgov
and
@
WHO
downplaying
aerosols.
”
While
Jimenez
and
others
sparred
on
social
media
,
Marr
worked
behind
the
scenes
to
raise
awareness
of
the
misunderstandings
around
aerosols
.
She
started
talking
to
Kimberly
Prather
,
an
atmospheric
chemist
at
UC
San
Diego
,
who
had
the
ear
of
prominent
public
health
leaders
within
the
CDC
and
on
the
White
House
Covid
Task
Force
.
In
July
,
the
two
women
sent
slides
to
Anthony
Fauci
,
director
of
the
National
Institutes
of
Allergy
and
Infectious
Diseases
.
One
of
them
showed
the
trajectory
of
a
5-micron
particle
released
from
the
height
of
the
average
person
’
s
mouth
.
It
went
farther
than
6
feet—hundreds
of
feet
farther
.
A
few
weeks
later
,
speaking
to
an
audience
at
Harvard
Medical
School
,
Fauci
admitted
that
the
5-micron
distinction
was
wrong—and
had
been
for
years
.
“
Bottom
line
is
,
there
is
much
more
aerosol
than
we
thought
,
”
he
said
.
(
Fauci
declined
to
be
interviewed
for
this
story
.
)
Still
,
the
droplet
dogma
reigned
.
In
early
October
,
Marr
and
a
group
of
scientists
and
doctors
published
a
letter
in
Science
urging
everyone
to
get
on
the
same
page
about
how
infectious
particles
move
,
starting
with
ditching
the
5-micron
threshold
.
Only
then
could
they
provide
clear
and
effective
advice
to
the
public
.
That
same
day
,
the
CDC
updated
its
guidance
to
acknowledge
that
SARS-CoV-2
can
spread
through
long-lingering
aerosols
.
But
it
didn
’
t
emphasize
them.That
winter
,
the
WHO
also
began
to
talk
more
publicly
about
aerosols
.
On
December
1
,
the
organization
finally
recommended
that
everyone
always
wear
a
mask
indoors
wherever
Covid-19
is
spreading
.
In
an
interview
,
the
WHO
’
s
Maria
Van
Kerkhove
said
that
the
change
reflects
the
organization
’
s
commitment
to
evolving
its
guidance
when
the
scientific
evidence
compels
a
change
.
She
maintains
that
the
WHO
has
paid
attention
to
airborne
transmission
from
the
beginning—first
in
hospitals
,
then
at
places
such
as
bars
and
restaurants
.
“
The
reason
we
’
re
promoting
ventilation
is
that
this
virus
can
be
airborne
,
”
Van
Kerkhove
says
.
But
because
that
term
has
a
specific
meaning
in
the
medical
community
,
she
admits
to
avoiding
it—and
emphasizing
instead
the
types
of
settings
that
pose
the
biggest
risks
.
Does
she
think
that
decision
has
harmed
the
public
health
response
,
or
cost
lives
?
No
,
she
says
.
“
People
know
what
they
need
to
do
to
protect
themselves.
”
Yet
she
admits
it
may
be
time
to
rethink
the
old
droplet-airborne
dichotomy
.
According
to
Van
Kerkhove
,
the
WHO
plans
to
formally
review
its
definitions
for
describing
disease
transmission
in
2021
.
For
Yuguo
Li
,
whose
work
had
so
inspired
Marr
,
these
moves
have
given
him
a
sliver
of
hope
.
“
Tragedy
always
teaches
us
something
,
”
he
says
.
The
lesson
he
thinks
people
are
finally
starting
to
learn
is
that
airborne
transmission
is
both
more
complicated
and
less
scary
than
once
believed
.
SARS-CoV-2
,
like
many
respiratory
diseases
,
is
airborne
,
but
not
wildly
so
.
It
isn
’
t
like
measles
,
which
is
so
contagious
it
infects
90
percent
of
susceptible
people
exposed
to
someone
with
the
virus
.
And
the
evidence
hasn
’
t
shown
that
the
coronavirus
often
infects
people
over
long
distances
.
Or
in
well-ventilated
spaces
.
The
virus
spreads
most
effectively
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
a
contagious
person
,
which
is
to
say
that
most
of
the
time
it
looks
an
awful
lot
like
a
textbook
droplet-based
pathogen
.
For
most
respiratory
diseases
,
not
knowing
which
route
caused
an
infection
has
not
been
catastrophic
.
But
the
cost
has
not
been
zero
.
Influenza
infects
millions
each
year
,
killing
between
300,000
and
650,000
globally
.
And
epidemiologists
are
predicting
the
next
few
years
will
bring
particularly
deadly
flu
seasons
.
Li
hopes
that
acknowledging
this
history—and
how
it
hindered
an
effective
global
response
to
Covid-19—will
allow
good
ventilation
to
emerge
as
a
central
pillar
of
public
health
policy
,
a
development
that
would
not
just
hasten
the
end
of
this
pandemic
but
beat
back
future
ones
.
To
get
a
glimpse
into
that
future
,
you
need
only
peek
into
the
classrooms
where
Li
teaches
or
the
Crossfit
gym
where
Marr
jumps
boxes
and
slams
medicine
balls
.
In
the
earliest
days
of
the
pandemic
,
Li
convinced
the
administrators
at
the
University
of
Hong
Kong
to
spend
most
of
its
Covid-19
budget
on
upgrading
the
ventilation
in
buildings
and
buses
rather
than
on
things
such
as
mass
Covid
testing
of
students
.
Marr
reviewed
blueprints
and
HVAC
schematics
with
the
owner
of
her
gym
,
calculating
the
ventilation
rates
and
consulting
on
a
redesign
that
moved
workout
stations
outside
and
near
doors
that
were
kept
permanently
open
.
To
date
,
no
one
has
caught
Covid
at
the
gym
.
Li
’
s
university
,
a
school
of
30,000
students
,
has
recorded
a
total
of
23
Covid-19
cases
.
Of
course
Marr
’
s
gym
is
small
,
and
the
university
benefited
from
the
fact
that
Asian
countries
,
scarred
by
the
2003
SARS
epidemic
,
were
quick
to
recognize
aerosol
transmission
.
But
Marr
's
and
Li
’
s
swift
actions
could
well
have
improved
their
odds
.
Ultimately
,
that
’
s
what
public
health
guidelines
do
:
They
tilt
people
and
places
closer
to
safety.On
Friday
,
April
30
,
the
WHO
quietly
updated
a
page
on
its
website
.
In
a
section
on
how
the
coronavirus
gets
transmitted
,
the
text
now
states
that
the
virus
can
spread
via
aerosols
as
well
as
larger
droplets
.
As
Zeynep
Tufekci
noted
in
The
New
York
Times
,
perhaps
the
biggest
news
of
the
pandemic
passed
with
no
news
conference
,
no
big
declaration
.
If
you
weren
’
t
paying
attention
,
it
was
easy
to
miss.But
Marr
was
paying
attention
.
She
couldn
’
t
help
but
note
the
timing
.
She
,
Li
,
and
two
other
aerosol
scientists
had
just
published
an
editorial
in
The
BMJ
,
a
top
medical
journal
,
entitled
“
Covid-19
Has
Redefined
Airborne
Transmission.
”
For
once
,
she
hadn
’
t
had
to
beg
;
the
journal
’
s
editors
came
to
her
.
And
her
team
had
finally
posted
their
paper
on
the
origins
of
the
5-micron
error
to
a
public
preprint
server
.
In
early
May
,
the
CDC
made
similar
changes
to
its
Covid-19
guidance
,
now
placing
the
inhalation
of
aerosols
at
the
top
of
its
list
of
how
the
disease
spreads
.
Again
though
,
no
news
conference
,
no
press
release
.
But
Marr
,
of
course
,
noticed
.
That
evening
,
she
got
in
her
car
to
pick
up
her
daughter
from
gymnastics
.
She
was
alone
with
her
thoughts
for
the
first
time
all
day
.
As
she
waited
at
a
red
light
,
she
suddenly
burst
into
tears
.
Not
sobbing
,
but
unable
to
stop
the
hot
stream
of
tears
pouring
down
her
face
.
Tears
of
exhaustion
,
and
relief
,
but
also
triumph
.
Finally
,
she
thought
,
they
’
re
getting
it
right
,
because
of
what
we
’
ve
done.The
light
turned
.
She
wiped
the
tears
away
.
Someday
it
would
all
sink
in
,
but
not
today
.
Now
,
there
were
kids
to
pick
up
and
dinner
to
eat
.
Something
approaching
normal
life
awaited.Let
us
know
what

those
hard-fought
gains
were
accompanied
by
a
grim
milestone
Tuesday
:
The
national
death
toll
reached
600,000
.
That
’
s
roughly
the
population
of
Milwaukee
or
Baltimore
.
And
experts
are
voicing
concerns
that
the
state
of
the
pandemic
could
once
again
take
a
turn
for
the
worse
in
the
US.The
menacing
coronavirus
variant
B
1.617.2
,
first
seen
in
India—now
dubbed
Delta
by
the
World
Health
Organization—is
spreading
rapidly
around
the
globe
,
including
in
the
US
.
It
is
estimated
to
be
even
more
contagious
than
the
worrisome
B.1.1.7
variant
first
seen
in
the
UK
.
That
variant
,
now
dubbed
Alpha
,
is
estimated
to
be
about
50
percent
more
transmissible
than
the
original
coronavirus
that
mushroomed
out
of
Wuhan
,
China
,
at
the
start
of
2020
.
Delta
is
estimated
to
be
50
to
60
percent
more
contagious
than
Alpha.In
the
UK
,
infections
with
the
Delta
variant
began
popping
up
at
very
low
levels
in
early
April
and
then
rose
swiftly
.
By
early
June
,
the
Delta
variant
was
accounting
for
more
than
60
percent
of
cases.Earlier
this
year
,
Alpha
out-spread
other
versions
of
the
virus
to
become
the
predominant
strain
in
the
US
.
Now
,
experts
expect
Delta
will
take
its
place
,
just
as
it
did
in
the
UK
.
The
US
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
on
Monday
officially
dubbed
Delta
a
``
variant
of
concern
.
``
``
Right
now
,
in
the
United
States
,
[
Delta
accounts
for
]
about
10
percent
of
infections
.
It
's
doubling
every
two
weeks
,
''
said
Scott
Gottlieb
,
former
commissioner
of
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
,
Sunday
on
Face
the
Nation
.
``
So
it
’
s
probably
going
to
become
the
dominant
strain
here
in
the
United
States
.
That
does
n't
mean
that
we
're
going
to
see
a
sharp
uptick
in
infections
,
but
it
does
mean
that
this
is
going
to
take
over
.
And
I
think
the
risk
is
really
to
the
fall—that
this
could
spike
a
new
epidemic
heading
into
the
fall
.
``
Adding
to
the
worry
is
new
data
that
suggests
Delta
may
also
cause
more
severe
disease—in
addition
to
spreading
to
more
people
.
Early
findings
out
of
Scotland
suggest
infections
with
the
Delta
variant
were
associated
with
nearly
double
the
risk
of
infected
persons
ending
up
hospitalized
compared
to
infections
with
the
Alpha
variant
.
The
data
was
published
Monday
as
correspondence
in
the
Lancet
.
Experts
say
they
’
ll
need
more
data
to
confirm
that
risk.The
good
news
in
all
of
this
is
that
being
fully
vaccinated
appears
to
protect
against
Delta
.
At
the
end
of
May
,
researchers
at
Public
Health
England
posted
data
(
which
had
not
been
peer-reviewed
)
indicating
that
two
doses
of
the
Pfizer-BioNTech
vaccine
were
88
percent
effective
at
preventing
a
symptomatic
infection
with
the
Delta
variant
.
Meanwhile
,
the
data
said
,
two
doses
of
the
Oxford-AstraZeneca
vaccine
were
60
percent
effective
.
(
Notably
,
just
one
shot
of
either
vaccine
was
not
protective
,
offering
only
33
percent
efficacy
against
symptomatic
Delta
infections
.
Experts
emphasized
the
importance
of
not
skipping
the
second
dose
.
)
Data
out
of
Scotland
on
Monday
likewise
suggested
that
two
doses
of
the
Pfizer-BioNTech
vaccine
were
79
percent
effective
against
the
Delta
variant
,
while
two
doses
of
Oxford-AstraZeneca
vaccine
were
again
60
percent
effective.Also
on
Monday
,
PHE
released
another
analysis
(
also
not
peer-reviewed
)
that
finds
that
two
doses
of
the
Pfizer-BioNTech
vaccine
were
96
percent
effective
against
hospitalization
,
and
two
doses
of
the
Oxford-AstraZeneca
vaccine
were
92
percent
effective
against
hospitalization.
“
So
we
have
the
tools
to
control
this
and
defeat
it
,
”
Gottlieb
noted.But
experts
are
still
concerned
.
The
pace
of
vaccination
has
slowed
significantly
in
the
US
,
and
many
states—particularly
in
the
South—are
far
behind
the
goal
of
getting
70
percent
of
adults
at
least
one
vaccine
.
Pockets
of
low
vaccination
are
fueling
fears
among
experts
,
including
Gottlieb
,
that
cases
could
once
again
spike
as
Delta
continues
its
spread.Peter
Hotez
,
director
of
the
Texas
Children
's
Hospital
Center
for
Vaccine
Development
,
echoed
that
concern
Tuesday
.
He
told
CNN
that
he
is
“
extremely
worried
”
about
the
Delta
variant
.
He
emphasized
that
right
now
is
“
crunch
time
”
to
get
fully
vaccinated—which
takes
five
to
six
weeks—before
Delta
spreads
further.In
a
press
briefing
last
week
,
top
infectious
disease
expert
Anthony
Fauci
made
a
similar
plea
,
pointing
to
the
rapid
spread
of
the
Delta
variant
in
the
UK
.
“
We
can
not
let
that
happen
in
the
United
States
,
”
he
said
.
This
“
is
such
a
powerful
argument
…
to
get
vaccinated.
”
This
story
originally
appeared
on
Ars
Technica.David
CoxAs
the
first
data
on
the
new
Delta
variant
of
Sars-CoV-2
began
to
trickle
through
in
April
and
early
May
,
Martin
McKee
was
immediately
convinced
that
a
third
wave
of
Covid-19
was
imminent.McKee
,
a
professor
of
European
public
health
at
the
London
School
of
Hygiene
and
Tropical
Medicine
,
was
particularly
shocked
when
he
saw
estimates
of
Delta
’
s
R
number
,
the
average
number
of
people
that
one
infected
person
will
go
on
to
infect
with
the
virus
.
“
You
could
see
this
was
a
much
more
transmissible
variant
,
”
says
McKee
.
On
June
16
,
Public
Health
England
’
s
strategic
Covid-19
response
director
told
MPs
that
if
the
new
variant
was
left
to
spread
uninhibited
,
its
R
number
could
be
between
five
and
seven.For
McKee
,
it
seemed
inevitable
that
new
cases
of
Covid-19
–
which
had
been
steadily
declining
since
early
January
–
would
begin
to
rise
again
.
On
June
24
,
the
number
of
daily
infections
in
the
UK
crossed
16,000
,
levels
not
seen
since
early
February
when
the
UK
was
still
in
full
lockdown.But
the
third
wave
will
look
very
different
to
the
last
two
.
While
the
Delta
variant
is
considered
to
be
more
virulent
than
any
that
have
previously
followed
,
the
UK
’
s
successful
vaccination
campaign
appears
to
have
broken
the
seemingly
inevitable
link
between
cases
,
hospitalisations
,
and
fatalities
.
The
current
hospitalisation
rate
remains
low
.
There
were
182
new
hospital
admissions
on
June
22
–
a
rate
of
16
per
1000
new
cases
–
compared
with
3,812
admissions
on
January
12
,
the
height
of
the
second
wave
,
a
rate
of
84
per
1000
new
cases.Boris
Johnson
’
s
government
is
currently
intending
to
end
all
restriction
measures
on
July
19
,
but
exactly
what
this
will
mean
for
new
cases
of
Covid-19
,
and
public
health
,
is
almost
impossible
to
predict
,
due
to
the
varying
degrees
of
immunity
to
the
virus
in
the
population.
“
The
third
wave
will
be
different
in
characteristics
to
before
,
but
the
situation
is
so
complex
to
model
,
”
says
Ravi
Gupta
,
professor
of
clinical
microbiology
at
the
University
of
Cambridge
.
“
You
have
lots
of
vaccinated
people
,
those
who
are
semi-immune
because
they
’
ve
already
been
infected
,
unvaccinated
people
,
and
a
lot
of
young
people.
”
In
addition
,
intensive
care
wards
report
a
very
fragmented
picture
across
the
UK
,
making
it
far
more
difficult
for
policymakers
to
form
a
coherent
strategy
.
While
the
third
wave
has
already
intensified
in
the
North
West
,
where
there
have
been
17,496
new
cases
over
the
last
seven
days
,
other
regions
are
still
seeing
relatively
little
transmission
.
“
Where
we
are
,
it
’
s
fine
,
”
says
Matt
Morgan
,
consultant
in
intensive
care
medicine
at
University
Hospital
of
Wales
.
“
Wales
is
doing
really
well
.
But
in
some
areas
in
the
North
and
the
West
Midlands
,
you
can
see
this
scooped
out
curve
of
hospital
numbers
climbing
which
is
the
big
concern.
”
Morgan
thinks
that
this
variation
between
regions
is
making
it
hard
for
the
public
,
mentally
fatigued
by
the
toll
of
repeated
lockdowns
,
to
accept
the
potential
threat
posed
by
the
third
wave
.
“
Waves
one
and
two
were
a
case
of
,
‘
We
're
all
in
it
together
,
’
to
some
extent
,
”
he
says
.
“
It
’
s
not
like
that
now
,
and
it
’
s
really
hard
for
people
to
get
the
narrative
that
the
vaccination
campaign
has
gone
so
well
,
yet
there
’
s
still
an
ongoing
risk.
”
While
the
NHS
continues
to
vaccinate
the
population
with
remarkable
efficiency
–
as
of
June
22
,
64
per
cent
of
the
country
had
received
at
least
one
dose
of
the
vaccine
–
there
remains
a
proportion
of
people
who
are
not
protected
.
Martin
Landray
,
a
professor
of
medicine
and
epidemiology
at
the
University
of
Oxford
,
points
out
that
there
will
be
a
percentage
of
elderly
individuals
who
have
not
mounted
a
full
immune
response
to
the
vaccine
,
while
the
effects
may
begin
to
wear
off
in
others
who
received
the
jab
in
the
early
months
of
the
campaign.Last
week
,
Nadhim
Zahawi
,
minister
for
Covid
vaccine
deployment
,
said
that
nine
out
of
ten
people
eligible
for
a
vaccine
had
accepted
one
.
However
Landray
points
out
that
this
still
means
that
one
tenth
of
those
who
should
have
received
the
jab
remain
unvaccinated
.
“
Either
they
did
n't
want
it
,
didn
’
t
turn
up
,
or
they
couldn
’
t
have
it
for
some
sort
of
medical
reason
.
Everyone
thinks
that
the
older
age
groups
are
covered
,
but
we
will
still
have
some
problems
with
unvaccinated
people
,
”
he
says.Landray
fears
that
if
case
numbers
continue
to
climb
,
the
virus
will
eventually
reach
those
vulnerable
individuals
in
the
months
to
come
,
potentially
causing
a
new
spike
in
hospitalisations
.
One
of
the
problems
is
that
people
who
have
been
fully
vaccinated
may
still
be
capable
of
transmitting
the
Delta
variant
to
some
extent
.
Gupta
points
to
a
study
of
Indian
healthcare
workers
,
which
showed
that
even
people
who
had
received
two
vaccine
doses
were
still
contributing
to
transmission
chains
within
hospitals
,
fueling
the
pandemic.As
a
result
,
McKee
believes
the
government
needs
to
look
at
vaccinating
teenagers
as
a
way
of
mitigating
the
threat
of
the
third
wave
to
the
old
and
vulnerable
.
“
This
needs
to
happen
at
the
absolute
minimum
,
”
says
McKee
.
“
The
Joint
Committee
on
Vaccination
and
Immunisation
is
looking
very
much
at
the
risks
and
benefits
to
children
themselves
,
but
we
have
a
long
tradition
in
countries
of
vaccinating
people
for
the
wider
benefit
.
We
vaccinate
children
against
influenza
partly
because
we
don
’
t
want
them
to
get
it
,
but
primarily
because
we
don
’
t
want
them
to
infect
their
grandparents.
”
A
lot
has
changed
since
the
first
wave
of
the
pandemics
.
Doctors
do
have
an
array
of
new
options
at
their
disposal
to
fight
the
virus
.
Over
the
past
year
,
the
UK
’
s
groundbreaking
RECOVERY
Trial
–
a
program
which
launched
in
March
2020
enrolling
tens
of
thousands
of
patients
at
dozens
of
hospitals
for
clinical
trials
investigating
Covid-19
therapies
–
has
provided
vital
information
on
treatments
which
work
,
and
those
that
do
not
.
Morgan
says
that
the
latter
information
is
just
as
important
,
as
it
has
helped
streamline
care
pathways
on
wards
and
in
intensive
care.As
a
result
,
convalescent
plasma
,
hydroxychloroquine
,
aspirin
,
colchicine
,
and
azithromycin
have
all
been
ruled
out
.
But
dexamethasone
,
tocilizumab
,
and
monoclonal
antibodies
–
artificial
antibodies
which
can
be
administered
to
elderly
or
immunosuppressed
patients
who
can
not
mount
an
immune
response
against
the
virus
,
via
an
intravenous
drip
–
have
been
shown
to
be
effective
life-saving
therapies.Dexamethasone
and
tocilizumab
,
both
help
to
dampen
the
deadly
cytokine
storm
which
has
been
widely
touted
as
the
driving
force
behind
many
of
the
fatalities
from
Covid-19
.
The
latter
treatment
has
only
been
available
from
December
2020
,
while
various
monoclonal
antibody
therapies
have
been
newly
approved
in
recent
weeks
as
a
result
of
new
data
from
the
RECOVERY
study.At
the
same
time
,
the
information
we
now
have
about
some
of
the
longer
term
impacts
of
the
virus
,
especially
Long
Covid
which
has
impacted
younger
,
previously
healthy
women
particularly
hard
,
means
that
the
risk
posed
by
the
third
wave
can
not
only
be
assessed
in
terms
of
hospitalisations
and
deaths.Accumulating
evidence
now
shows
that
SarS-CoV-2
can
persist
in
the
brain
as
a
chronic
infection
,
causing
structural
changes
,
and
inducing
a
higher
risk
of
strokes
,
muscle
disorders
,
dementia
,
and
psychiatric
disorders
,
even
among
non-hospitalised
patients.The
third
wave
will
almost
certainly
look
very
different
to
before
.
There
will
inevitably
be
fatalities
,
but
not
of
the
levels
of
the
previous
two
waves
.
As
a
result
,
some
doctors
feel
that
any
decisions
on
re-implementing
restrictions
in
the
months
to
come
are
likely
to
be
moral
and
ethical
questions
,
rather
than
medical
necessity.
“
I
think
wave
one
,
wave
two
,
it
was
clear
that
there
was
a
huge
emerging
wave
of
infections
and
hospitalisations
and
deaths
,
”
says
Morgan
.
“
Now
,
it
’
s
different
.
I
don
’
t
think
these
are
medical
decisions
anymore
,
they
are
ethical
,
moral
and
societal
decisions
,
and
they
have
to
be
answered
by
society
,
governments
,
and
ethical
institutions.

year
’
s
WIRED
Health
:
Tech
conference
took
place
online
last
month
,
in
an
effort
to
adapt
to
the
challenges
posed
by
the
current
pandemic.A
range
of
specialists
held
presentations
about
the
latest
advances
in
medical
technology
,
including
remote
surgical
systems
,
e-health
,
CRISPR
technology
,
and
the
issue
on
everyone
’
s
mind
this
year
:
how
research
can
combat
the
COVID-19
pandemic.In
this
Special
Feature
,
we
offer
an
overview
of
the
panels
and
main
takeaways
from
the
presentations.Throughout
many
of
the
WIRED
Health
:
Tech
presentations
,
the
recurring
theme
was
how
technology
is
helping
—
or
hindering
—
the
fight
against
SARS-CoV-2
,
the
coronavirus
that
has
given
rise
to
the
current
pandemic.Prof
.
Heidi
Larson
—
from
the
London
School
of
Hygiene
&
Tropical
Medicine
in
the
United
Kingdom
—
spoke
of
the
global
response
to
vaccines
,
an
issue
of
paramount
importance
in
the
context
of
the
pandemic.Prof
.
Larson
noted
that
according
to
her
and
her
colleagues
’
research
—
which
appears
in
The
Lancet
—
“
people
’
s
feelings
about
vaccines
have
become
far
more
volatile.
”
“
It
’
s
a
lot
more
like
political
opinion
polling
.
They
used
to
be
much
more
stable
10–20
years
ago
.
You
knew
who
agreed
and
who
was
less
confident
around
vaccines
,
but
that
’
s
changing
very
frequently
,
”
she
observed.However
,
she
did
offer
some
positive
news
:
“
The
overall
picture
is
that
[
…
]
there
is
a
general
trend
where
people
are
becoming
a
little
more
confident
[
about
vaccines
]
than
they
were
5
years
ago.
”
According
to
Prof.
Larson
,
this
may
be
because
public
health
specialists
and
communicators
are
more
proactive
in
dismantling
pervasive
myths
about
vaccination
over
the
past
few
years.Nevertheless
,
she
cautioned
,
“
we
do
see
that
Europe
remains
the
lowest
in
confidence
,
the
most
skeptical
,
with
countries
like
Lithuania
[
where
]
only
19
%
strongly
believe
that
vaccines
are
safe
.
The
highest
[
rate
]
is
[
in
]
Finland
,
at
66
%
—
and
that
’
s
just
‘
strongly
believe
.
'
”
“
Poland
had
the
most
significant
drop
in
confidence
in
vaccines
,
”
she
noted.She
also
emphasized
these
fluctuations
in
confidence
in
vaccines
across
the
globe
occurred
before
the
pandemic
.
In
the
current
situation
,
Prof.
Larson
said
,
sentiments
surrounding
vaccinations
have
become
even
more
volatile.
“
Because
of
the
hyper-uncertainty
and
the
whole
environment
of
trust
and
distrust
around
the
COVID
vaccine
,
there
are
groups
that
have
gotten
together
to
resist
even
the
COVID
vaccine
,
”
she
warned.The
danger
of
anti-vaccination
mentalities
can
only
be
mitigated
by
giving
science
more
of
a
“
human
face
,
”
Prof
Larson
argued
:
“
We
need
to
bring
together
the
scientific
,
technological
advances
that
are
so
valuable
,
and
not
lose
the
human
face
,
but
bring
that
back
together
[
with
the
scientific
perspective
]
.
This
isn
’
t
just
a
misinformation
problem
.
This
is
a
relationship
problem
.
This
is
a
cultural
revolution
,
saying
‘
we
need
to
change
,
we
need
to
get
back
to
a
more
human
face
in
the
scientific
and
medical
field.
'
”
Prof
.
Devi
Sridhar
—
a
public
health
advisor
and
the
chair
of
the
Global
Public
Health
department
at
the
University
of
Edinburgh
in
the
U.K.
—
spoke
of
the
next
steps
in
the
fight
against
the
pandemic.Speaking
of
the
U.K.
situation
,
Prof.
Sridhar
said
that
there
are
certain
key
actions
that
the
country
needs
to
take
to
put
a
stop
to
the
spread
of
the
virus
more
efficiently
:
“
I
think
the
crucial
thing
is
getting
the
testing
sorted
.
You
need
to
have
a
test
turnaround
time
[
of
]
less
than
24
hours
and
have
testing
widely
available
.
And
also
[
…
]
a
strategy
:
What
is
the
point
of
a
lockdown
,
what
[
is
]
the
point
of
the
restrictions
?
”
“
Other
countries
have
used
the
lockdown
—
I
’
m
thinking
of
New
Zealand
,
Taiwan
,
Vietnam
,
Thailand
,
Australia
[
…
]
—
but
they
’
re
using
the
lockdown
to
try
and
eliminate
the
virus
,
to
get
rid
of
it
,
and
then
put
in
place
checks
for
reimportation
,
”
she
added.Prof
.
Agnes
Binagwaho
—
vice
chancellor
at
the
University
of
Global
Health
Equity
in
Rwanda
—
went
on
to
speak
of
the
innovations
that
Rwandan
authorities
implemented
to
curb
the
spread
of
the
new
coronavirus
in
the
country.Prof
.
Binagwaho
said
that
the
first
step
was
to
identify
both
the
obstacles
and
facilitators
when
it
came
to
stopping
the
spread
of
SARS-CoV-2.According
to
the
expert
,
having
a
clear
idea
of
these
factors
allowed
the
authorities
to
establish
the
best
strategy
for
containing
the
spread
of
the
virus.Most
importantly
,
however
,
according
to
Prof.
Binagwaho
,
Rwandan
authorities
made
sure
to
keep
its
citizens
up-to-date
with
all
the
daily
news
regarding
the
local
spread
of
the
virus
—
both
good
and
bad.
“
[
W
]
hen
you
need
the
population
to
do
something
to
protect
itself
[
…
]
that
is
not
usual
,
trust
counts
more
than
money
,
”
she
commented.Some
of
the
technological
innovations
that
the
country
implemented
during
the
pandemic
were
robots
that
take
people
’
s
temperatures
in
airports
and
hospitals
,
to
limit
human
contact
,
and
drones
that
carry
supplies
to
areas
that
lack
appropriate
resources.Prof
.
Christofer
Toumazou
—
from
Imperial
College
London
in
the
U.K.
—
spoke
of
how
technological
advances
could
help
during
the
current
pandemic.Prof
.
Toumazou
,
an
electronic
engineer
,
created
DnaNudge
,
a
fast
and
accessible
DNA
testing
technology
.
Its
original
purpose
was
helping
people
understand
what
health
conditions
their
genetic
makeup
might
predispose
them
to
,
so
they
could
make
healthier
choices.At
WIRED
,
the
researcher
and
his
colleagues
said
that
they
adapted
this
technology
to
detect
COVID-19
,
creating
tests
with
a
turnaround
time
of
only
90
minutes.In
the
U.K.
,
the
government
ordered
5.8
million
such
tests
for
state
hospitals.
“
Effectively
,
it
took
a
pandemic
for
us
to
get
a
technology
that
’
s
[
…
]
prepared
for
personalized
medicine
into
the
hospital
system
.
So
the
only
way
that
we
could
‘
bulldoze
’
this
was
through
COVID
,
”
Prof.
Toumazou
noted.The
researcher
emphasized
just
how
important
this
step
may
be
for
health
,
particularly
for
people
with
mental
health
conditions
,
who
would
not
have
to
anxiously
“
wait
for
48
hours
in
isolation
”
for
their
test
results.In
a
panel
discussion
,
Dr.
Indra
Joshi
—
director
of
Artificial
Intelligence
at
NHSx
,
the
U.K.
governmental
unit
responsible
for
developing
national
health
policies
—
also
went
on
to
stress
that
advanced
technology
may
help
not
just
to
better
understand
the
pathology
of
COVID-19
,
but
also
to
identify
the
people
who
are
most
at
risk.This
,
she
added
,
could
allow
healthcare
professionals
to
provide
help
faster
to
those
who
are
likely
to
be
the
most
affected
by
infection
with
the
new
coronavirus.In
Dr.
Joshi
’
s
view
,
advances
in
technology
could
therefore
offer
a
“
holistic
view
”
of
a
person
’
s
health
status
and
risks
,
beyond
diagnosing
COVID-19.Another
panel
discussion
focused
on
recent
developments
in
finding
a
vaccine
against
the
new
coronavirus.The
two
participants
were
Tal
Zaks
,
Chief
Medical
Officer
of
Moderna
Therapeutics
,
and
Prof.
Uğur
Şahin
,
co-founder
and
CEO
of
BioNTech.Both
Moderna
and
BioNTech
are
testing
mRNA
candidate
vaccines
,
which
use
genetic
information
rather
than
a
viral
base
to
train
the
immune
system
against
the
new
coronavirus.Speaking
of
the
advantages
of
an
mRNA
vaccine
versus
other
forms
of
vaccines
,
Zaks
said
that
“
it
is
better
in
a
number
of
fundamental
ways.
”
“
The
first
is
that
because
we
start
with
genetic
information
,
there
is
a
component
of
speed
that
allows
you
to
get
into
the
clinic
and
then
,
once
you
’
re
in
the
clinic
,
scale-up
manufacturing
.
It
’
s
not
by
chance
that
the
two
leading
efforts
both
leverage
mRNA
technologies
,
”
he
pointed
out.
“
I
think
the
second
one
[
…
]
is
the
biological
preciseness
—
so
,
when
you
make
a
recombinant
protein
,
or
you
otherwise
characterize
a
biologic
,
the
process
makes
a
lot
of
difference
and
a
lot
of
things
can
go
wrong
.
When
you
’
re
transmitting
the
[
genetic
]
information
,
there
’
s
no
way
for
the
cell
to
make
the
wrong
bit
.
So
the
biological
fidelity
,
if
you
will
,
has
a
higher
likelihood
to
then
translate
into
the
kind
of
immune
response
you
want.
”
–
Tal
Zaks
“
I
think
the
last
element
here
is
it
’
s
a
very
flexible
platform
,
and
this
takes
us
a
little
bit
beyond
COVID
,
but
the
infrastructure
required
is
relatively
small
and
quick
,
which
means
,
in
the
manufacturing
space
,
you
have
tremendous
agility
that
usual
technologies
don
’
t
,
”
Zaks
added.At
the
time
of
the
WIRED
conference
,
clinical
trials
for
the
Moderna
and
BioNTech
candidate
vaccines
were
at
similar
stages
.
Since
the
two
approaches
have
similar
premises
,
the
question
arises
:
does
this
create
a
sense
of
competition
between
the
two
companies
?
According
to
Zaks
,
in
the
context
of
a
pandemic
,
this
is
not
a
valid
question
.
“
I
only
have
two
competitors
here
:
the
virus
and
the
clock
,
”
he
asserted.He
added
that
should
both
the
Moderna
and
the
BioNTech
candidate
vaccines
demonstrate
safety
and
efficacy
,
this
would
be
an
ideal
situation.
“
The
world
needs
more
than
one
company
to
succeed
here
,
”
he
said
,
noting
that
,
if
the
virus
is
truly
here
to
stay
,
as
previous
research
suggests
,
more
than
one
vaccine
may
become
necessary
in
the
long
run.Prof
.
Şahin
agreed
:
“
The
way
[
in
which
]
the
whole
industry
developed
vaccines
against
COVID-19
[
…
]
is
the
best
performance
of
collaboration
.
It
’
s
important
to
see
how
people
team
up
for
collaboration
.
Moderna
teamed
up
with
the
NIH
[
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
]
,
we
teamed
up
with
Pfizer
,
AstraZeneca
teamed
up
with
Oxford
University
.
So
there
are
several
models
of
collaboration
,
and
we
have
the
strongest
transparency
in
the
development
of
a
vaccine.
”
“
People
see
the
data
almost
in
real-time
coming
in
,
and
people
understand
how
[
a
]
phase
1
trial
works
,
how
a
phase
3
trial
works
,
and
Moderna
and
we
even
shared
our
phase
3
protocols
so
that
everyone
can
see
in
a
transparent
fashion
how
the
studies
perform
and
how
they
are
evaluated
,
”
Prof.
Şahin
added.The
two
researchers
also
emphasized
that
this
sense
of
transparency
regarding
the
development
of
new
pharmaceutical
products
is
essential
in
the
long
run
.
They
also
expressed
hope
that
it
may
persist
after
the
pandemic
subsides.When
asked
whether
the
candidate
vaccine
development
was
rushed
,
so
that
pharmaceuticals
can
distribute
them
sooner
rather
than
later
,
Prof.
Şahin
explained
that
the
pandemic
has
caused
researchers
to
find
a
better
,
more
efficient
method
of
proceeding
with
clinical
trials
—
not
a
less
reliable
one.
“
One
important
aspect
is
that
instead
of
skipping
[
steps
]
or
cutting
corners
,
we
decided
to
do
things
in
parallel
.
Usually
,
[
in
]
vaccine
development
[
…
]
you
do
a
phase
1
study
,
and
maybe
6
or
12
months
later
a
phase
2
study
,
and
then
decide
whether
you
would
do
a
phase
3
study
,
”
he
explained.
“
This
is
based
on
minimizing
the
cost
risk
,
but
also
based
on
the
traditional
way
[
in
which
a
vaccine
]
is
developed
.
It
is
not
the
best
way
—
it
is
just
the
traditional
way
,
”
he
also
emphasized.While
many
of
the
talks
at
WIRED
Health
:
Tech
revolved
around
the
fight
against
COVID-19
,
some
also
focused
on
other
technological
advances
in
improving
patient
care.Dr
.
Eric
Topol
—
founder
and
director
of
the
Scripps
Research
TranslationalInstitute
—
talked
about
using
technology
to
make
medicine
“
more
humanistic.
”
“
The
main
objective
of
AI
for
healthcare
and
medicine
has
been
to
improve
accuracy
,
”
so
that
doctors
can
improve
how
they
diagnose
disease
and
care
for
their
patients
,
he
observed.This
is
what
is
known
as
“
precision
medicine.
”
But
Dr.
Topol
believes
that
using
AI
in
medical
practice
could
bring
about
more
“
far-reaching
benefits.
”
This
could
include
freeing
healthcare
practitioners
from
tasks
,
such
as
filing
information
about
their
patients
into
digital
systems
,
so
that
they
can
pay
more
attention
to
their
patients.
“
Medicine
has
eroded
terribly
—
it
’
s
a
rushed
job
,
”
Dr.
Topol
asserted
in
his
talk
.
“
We
see
patients
in
a
single-digit
number
of
minutes
,
and
that
’
s
not
enough.
”
“
You
need
the
gift
of
time
,
which
AI
can
give
back
so
that
people
don
’
t
feel
so
rushed
and
doctors
and
nurses
and
clinicians
don
’
t
feel
so
rushed
either
.
[
…
]
We
want
to
have
clinicians
and
doctors
spending
more
time
with
patients
and
less
time
[
at
the
computer
]
keyboard.

Pearse
Keane
—
a
National
Institute
for
Health
Research
clinician-scientist
at
the
Institute
of
Ophthalmology
at
University
College
London
—
spoke
of
how
doctors
could
soon
use
AI
algorithms
to
diagnose
and
treat
early-stage
retinal
diseases
—
a
set
of
eye
problems
that
can
lead
to
vision
loss
.
Dr.
Keane
made
a
similar
point
to
Dr.
Topol
’
s
argument
,
stressing
that
so
many
people
are
affected
by
eye
diseases
in
the
U.K.
that
specialists
are
often
overwhelmed
by
the
sheer
amount
of
patients
waiting
for
diagnosis
and
treatment.
“
Some
people
are
essentially
going
blind
because
they
can
not
be
seen
and
treated
early
enough
,
”
Dr.
Keane
said
.
But
“
new
technologies
—
and
in
particular
,
AI
,
have
at
least
some
role
in
addressing
this
problem
,
”
he
added.Dr
.
Keane
and
colleagues
from
Moorfields
Eye
Hospital
collaborated
with
scientists
specializing
in
using
the
AI
technology
DeepMind
,
in
demonstrating
how
to
train
the
system
to
diagnose
retinal
diseases
correctly
and
fast-track
referrals
for
specialist
treatment.The
researchers
published
the
results
of
their
study
in
Nature
Medicine
in
2018
.
Now
,
Moorfields
Eye
Hospital
are
building
a
new
care
and
research
center
,
with
plans
to
integrate
more
advanced
technology
into
this
setting.But
Dr.
Keane
argues
that
clinical
AI
help
by
linking
various
health
data
,
therefore
offering
a
bigger
picture
of
a
person
’
s
overall
health
status
and
health
risks.Dr
.
Mark
Slack
—
chief
medical
officer
and
co-founder
of
CMR
Surgical
—
spoke
of
the
potential
of
Versius
,
a
surgical
robotic
system
that
can
help
specialists
carry
out
minimally
invasive
keyhole
surgery.
“
Is
keyhole
surgery
better
than
open
surgery
?
There
are
huge
advantages
for
keyhole
surgery
,
”
Dr
.
Slack
asserted
in
his
presentation.
“
If
you
have
a
large
wound
[
following
open
surgery
]
,
about
50
%
of
those
patients
will
go
back
to
the
hospital
.
If
you
have
a
small
,
minimal-access
wound
,
almost
none
will
go
back
.
If
you
have
a
large
wound
,
about
a
fifth
of
patients
will
be
required
to
go
back
into
[
the
operating
]
theater
if
they
get
a
wound
infection
[
…
]
[
but
]
roughly
50
%
of
complications
are
reduced
by
having
keyhole
surgery
rather
than
open
[
surgery
]
.

Prof.
Jennifer
Doudna
—
a
biochemist
at
UC
Berkeley
and
founder
of
the
Innovative
Genomics
Institute
,
who
co-invented
CRISPR
technology
—
spoke
of
the
revolutionary
potential
of
gene
editing
.
This
new
technology
has
taken
the
medical
research
world
by
storm.Prof
.
Doudna
described
gene-editing
technology
as
“
molecular
surgery
”
—
“
it
’
s
a
way
to
alter
the
DNA
in
cells
and
organisms
in
ways
that
allow
precise
correction
of
disease-causing
[
genetic
]
mutations
and
also
allow
scientists
to
do
all
sorts
of
other
kinds
of
manipulations
of
genetic
material
on
living
cells
and
organisms
,
”
she
explained.One
way
in
which
gene-editing
tools
might
be
helpful
,
she
said
,
might
be
by
helping
treat
severe
blood
disorders
such
as
sickle
cell
disease
.
Other
applications
might
be
in
the
treatment
of
eye
diseases
or
even
muscular
dystrophy.The
scientist
explained
that
,
besides
CRISPR
technology
’
s
potential
in
treating
disease
,
it
could
also
come
in
handy
when
detecting
viruses
,
including
the
new
coronavirus.She
even
suggested
that
“
in
the
coming
months
,
”
there
may
be
“
a
CRISPR-based
point-of-care
diagnostic
”
tool
that
could
help
doctors
identify
infections
much
faster.She
concluded
her
talk
by
noting
that
:
“
The
potential
of
this
technology
continues
to
advance
.
I
think
the
keys
will
be
delivery
and
control
of
the
editing
and
,
of
course
,
ensuring
safety
,
effectiveness
,
and
access
.
The
possibilities
are
extraordinary
—
it

really
an
exciting
time
to
be
working
in
this
field.

Half
of
US
adults
have
been
vaccinated
,
and
new
incentives
aim
to
keep
that
number
risingAs
of
this
week
,
half
of
all
adults
in
the
US
have
been
vaccinated
against
the
coronavirus
.
In
nine
states
,
70
percent
of
adults
have
received
at
least
one
dose
of
a
vaccine
.
To
keep
vaccination
numbers
rising
,
states
and
businesses
have
offered
all
kinds
of
incentives
.
CVS
,
for
instance
,
is
offering
prizes
to
people
who
get
vaccinated
,
including
tickets
to
next
year
’
s
Super
Bowl
and
a
weeklong
cruise
.
And
on
Thursday
an
Ohio
woman
won
$
1
million
through
the
state
’
s
Vax-a-Million
lottery
,
which
was
open
to
any
resident
who
received
at
least
one
shot.With
the
CDC
’
s
newly
updated
mask
guidelines
,
people
who
’
ve
been
vaccinated
can
forgo
a
mask
in
many
settings
.
Unfortunately
,
this
makes
it
easier
for
unvaccinated
people
to
go
maskless
,
too
.
One
way
around
this
could
be
vaccine
verification
systems
,
or
“
passports
,
”
but
setting
that
system
up
will
likely
be
complicated
and
messy
.
In
the
meantime
,
there
are
other
ways
to
let
people
know
if
you
’
ve
received
your
shot.Vaccine
diplomacy

India
negotiates
a

and
BioNTech
are
in
talks
with
the
Indian
government
to
supply
50
million
doses
of
their
coronavirus
vaccine
starting
this
summer
.
Unlike
many
other
countries
’
leaders
,
Prime
Minister
Modi
didn
’
t
sign
advance
purchase
agreements
earlier
on
because
he
believed
India
had
the
virus
under
control
.
The
sticking
point
of
the
negotiations
has
been
that
Pfizer
wants
to
be
protected
from
legal
liability
where
severe
side
effects
are
concerned
.
Other
countries
have
granted
indemnity
,
but
India
hasn
’
t
given
it
to
any
vaccine
makers
,
though
they
seem
likely
to
agree
to
Pfizer-BioNTech
’
s
terms.Hungary
,

boasts
one
of

most
robust

drives
in

Thursday
that

more
than
140,000
stockpiled

the
US
has
yet
to
ship
out
any
of
the
80
million
doses
it
promised
to
send
to
other

The
country
is
due
to
host
the

about
a

after
,
despite

opposition
from
its
citizens
.
Though
new
cases
are
declining
,
Japan
is
still
in
the

of
another
wave
,
and
vaccination
rates
remain
among
the
lowest
among
developed
countries.Several
other
countries
have
also
recently
instituted
public
health
measures
amid
new
outbreaks
of
the
virus
.
In

,
a
weeklong
lockdown
began
on
Thursday
night
when
authorities
discovered
a
26-case

And
in
the

there
still
trials
investigating
potential
Covid-19
therapeutics
?
In
recent
weeks
,
researchers
in
Europe
and
the
US
have
started
or
resumed
efforts
to
find
drugs
that
can
treat
Covid-19
.
Two
large-scale
,
randomized
trials
of
multiple
drugs—one
from
the
WHO
and
another
from
the
NIH—are
relaunching
efforts
to
repurpose
existing
oral
drugs
to
treat
people
in
the
early
stages
of
coming
down
with
Covid
.
The
fact
that
these
studies
are
just
kicking
into
high
gear
now
underscores
many
of
the
problems
with
how
drugs
are
identified
and
evaluated
:
Most
of
the
trials
that
began
earlier
either
weren

randomized
or
didn

t
have
enough
subjects
to
draw
meaningful

But
these
bigger

more
encompassing
approaches
could
finally

Given
that
this

is
unlikely
to
go
away

Cases
fall
to
record
lows
in
the
US
as
new
incentives
drive
more
people
to
get
their
shotsConfirmed
coronavirus
case
counts
in
the
US
are
now
the
lowest
they
’
ve
been
since
March
2020
.
And
experts
say
the
country
is
unlikely
to
see
a
surge
this
summer
,
thanks
to
rising
vaccination
rates
.
To
date
,
63
percent
of
American
adults
have
received
at
least
one
shot
,
and
President
Biden
recently
outlined
an
aggressive
plan
to
reach
his
goal
of
having
70
percent
at
least
partly
vaccinated
by
July
4
.
He
urged
Americans
to
get
the
jab
and
convince
others
to
as
well
,
and
he
highlighted
incentives
for
those
who
do
,
such
as
the
chance
for
a
year
of
free
flights
or
free
tickets
to
the
Super
Bowl.Lately
,
many
states
and
companies
have
introduced
their
own
sweepstakes
for
people
who
’
ve
received
a
shot
.
These
range
from
the
promise
of
a
free
beer
to
a
chance
of
winning
$
1
million
,
and
they
seem
to
be
working
.
In
Ohio
,
for
example
,
week-on-week
vaccinations
were
declining
by
25
percent
until
the
governor
announced
that
five
people
would
win
$
1
million
each
in
a
lottery
for
the
vaccinated.The
US
sends
out
its
first
shipment
of
surplus
Covid-19
vaccines
to
countries
in
needYesterday
the
US
sent
its
first
shipment
of
Covid-19
vaccines
to
countries
in
need
and
outlined
how
it
will
share
its
surplus
with
the
rest
of
the
world
.
Three-quarters
of
the
first
25
million
doses
to
be
sent
out
will
be
allocated
through
the
World
Health
Organization
's
Covax
initiative
,
which
sends
vaccines
to
the
world
’
s
poorest
countries
.
The
first
priority
for
those
shots
will
be
Latin
America
and
the
Caribbean
,
South
and
Southeast
Asia
,
and
Africa
.
After
that
,
shots
will
go
to
places
that
have
made
requests
to
the
White
House
,
including
India
and
Gaza
.
The
White
House
made
clear
that
there
will
be
no
strings
attached
to
these
shipments.As
cases
rise
across
the
world
,
the
need
for
better
,
more
equitable
vaccine
distribution
is
increasingly
urgent
.
Earlier
this
week
,
the
WHO
approved
the
vaccine
from
China
’
s
Sinovac
to
be
sent
out
through
Covax
.
The
shot
is
easy
to
store
and
could
make
a
significant
dent
in
worldwide
demand
for
shots.The
EU
prepares
for
summer
travel
despite
concerns
about
variantsLast
week
,
seven
countries
in
the
EU
began
using
the
region
’
s
Digital
Green
Certificate
,
which
designates
whether
someone
has
been
fully
vaccinated
,
recovered
from
Covid-19
,
or
tested
negative
within
the
past
72
hours
.
The
certificate
is
free
and
should
be
in
use
in
all
27
EU
countries
by
July
1.But
the
path
toward
summer
travel
hasn
’
t
been
uniformly
smooth
across
the
continent
.
This
week
,
the
UK
changed
its
guidelines
on
travel
to
Portugal
,
catching
some
vacationers
by
surprise
.
The
country
was
designated
an
“
amber
”
destination
rather
than
“
green
,
”
meaning
that
travelers
would
need
to
quarantine
for
10
days
upon
their
return
to
the
UK
.
Officials
said
this
switch
stemmed
in
part
from
concern
that
travelers
could
bring
more
variants
into
the
country
when
they
returned
home
.
This
decision
comes
shortly
after
the
UK
announced
it
would
launch
a
new
“
global
pandemic
radar
”
system
to
track
Covid
variants
and
new
emerging
diseases
more
effectively.Finding
activities
the
whole
family
will
enjoy
can
be
tough
,
especially
when
everyone
is
differently
abled
.
But
adaptive
game
controllers
are
making
it
possible
for
everyone
to
play
video
games
together
at
once.In
the
1970s
,
Hewlett-Packard
came
out
with
an
oximeter
that
would
now
be
considered
a
technological
dinosaur
.
But
in
many
ways
,
it
’
s
more
advanced
than
those
on
the
market
today
:
It
worked
equitably
,
regardless
of
skin
color
,
gender
,
or
disability
status
.
So
why
don
’
t
today
’
s
more
advanced
models
meet
the
same
standards
?
Whether
you
plan
to
bask
in
the
sun
or
cool
off
indoors
this
summer
,
here
are
a
few
of
our
favorite
nature-themed
board
games
to
play
that
will
get
you
in
the
spirit
of
the
season.How
has
the
pandemic
changed
the
homeschooling
community
in
the
US
?
Last
fall
,
parents
across
the
country
who
were
sick
of
remote
learning
but
wary
of
sending
their
kids
back
into
classrooms
opted
to
take
classes
into
their
own
hands
.
Now
some
plan
to
stick
with
it
even
after
the
pandemic
.
Though
homeschoolers
in
America
have
stereotypically
been
white
and
isolationist
,
a
diverse
swath
of
families
took
the
opportunity
to
customize
their
kids
’
learning
in
the
last
year
,
often
with
the
help
of
tech
.
Virtual
communities
,
especially
those
based
on
cultural
and
racial
groups
,
have
been
key
to
attracting
and
informing
a
broader
set
of
families
about
educating
their
own
kids.We
know
this
because
swabs
of
pulmonary
secretions
taken
from
the
eight
Malaysians
during
their
illness
were
stored
as
part
of
a
screening
project
,
and
then
analyzed
last
year
by
a
Duke
University
team
seeking
to
validate
a
new
test
.
What
they
found
,
and
described
two
weeks
ago
in
Clinical
Infectious
Diseases
,
may
show
a
novel
coronavirus
in
the
process
of
leaping
from
the
animal
world
into
people
,
as
the
virus
that
causes
Covid
probably
did
in
2019.That
new
virus
might
have
been
an
accidental
bystander
in
the
airways
of
those
Malaysian
patients
,
whose
swabs
variously
also
turned
up
evidence
of
adenoviruses
,
rhinoviruses
or
flu
.
Or
it
might
have
been
a
cause
of
their
disease
.
It
’
s
too
soon
to
know
.
(
To
be
clear
:
It
wasn
’
t
Covid
.
Canine
coronaviruses
and
the
viral
cause
of
Covid
belong
to
separate
genera
of
the
coronavirus
family
.
)
Nevertheless
,
researchers
in
the
world
of
emerging
infections
are
absolutely
sure
about
this
:
It
should
have
been
found
much
sooner
.
Covid
is
supposed
to
have
demonstrated
that
we
need
faster
detection
.
That
a
possible
novel
pathogen
could
lie
concealed
in
a
lab
freezer
since
as
early
as
2017
shows
how
much
work
we
still
have
to
do.
“
A
novel
coronavirus
reached
human
populations
and
we
did
not
find
out
about
it
until
an
academic
publication
?
”
Colin
J.
Carlson
asks
in
exasperation
.
Carlson
is
an
assistant
professor
at
Georgetown
University
Medical
Center
and
principal
investigator
for
a
consortium
called
the
Viral
Emergence
Research
Initiative
.
“
This
should
show
us
that
the
notification
system
for
human
disease
is
broken
,
”
he
continues.As
it
happens
,
an
effort
to
repair
disease
detection
was
announced
just
one
day
after
that
paper
appeared
online
.
On
May
21
,
United
Kingdom
prime
minister
Boris
Johnson
said
his
government
will
create
a
new
“
global
pandemic
radar
”
to
track
Covid
variants
and
emerging
diseases
,
built
on
the
UK
’
s
known
expertise
in
genomic
sequencing
for
tracking
Covid
strains
within
its
borders
.
“
We
need
to
build
a
system
of
disease
surveillance
fit
for
the
21st
century
,
with
real-time
data
sharing
and
rapid
genomic
sequencing
and
response
,
”
Johnson
said
at
the
time.There
is
little
disagreement
that
better
,
faster
surveillance
is
needed
.
In
fact
,
the
first
independent
review
of
the
Covid
crisis
,
published
two
weeks
before
Johnson
’
s
announcement
,
called
the
global
alert
system
“
too
slow—and
too
meek.
”
In
a
scathing
report
,
the
Independent
Panel
for
Pandemic
Preparedness
and
Response
called
Covid
“
the
21st
century
’
s
Chernobyl
moment
”
and
said
a
key
element
of
pandemic
prevention
should
be
“
a
new
global
system
for
surveillance
,
based
on
full
transparency
by
all
parties
,
using
state-of-the-art
digital
tools.
”
It
’
s
no
accident
these
announcements
were
made
so
close
together
.
May
and
June
are
when
global
governance
traditionally
attends
to
global
health
,
with
meetings
of
the
health
ministers
of
the
G7
and
G20
groups
of
nations
and
also
the
World
Health
Assembly
,
the
gathering
of
the
194-member
nations
that
jointly
set
policy
for
the
World
Health
Organization
.
The
UK
currently
holds
the
presidency
of
the
G7
;
Johnson
made
his
announcement
at
a
summit
in
Italy
before
the
assembly
,
as
prep
for
hosting
a
G7
ministers
’
meeting
this
week.So
,
after
17
months
of
this
pandemic
,
the
world
is
turning
its
attention
to
more
rapid
identification
of
whichever
one
comes
next
.
That
’
s
good
.
And
yet
:
The
world
already
possesses
many
surveillance
systems
,
some
that
existed
before
Covid
and
others
that
have
been
created
in
response.Here
,
have
some
acronyms
.
The
WHO
supervises
the
10-year-old
GOARN
(
the
Global
Outbreak
Alert
and
Response
Network
)
,
a
kind
of
worldwide
listening
network
,
and
a
new
hub
for
pandemic
intelligence
in
Berlin
.
It
also
oversees
GISRS
(
the
Global
Influenza
Surveillance
and
Response
System
)
,
a
network
made
up
of
institutions
in
123
nations
.
Then
there
are
national
,
philanthropic
,
and
NGO-based
surveillance
systems
,
including
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
’
s
network
CREID
(
Centers
for
Research
in
Emerging
Infectious
Diseases
)
;
the
new
French
agency
PREZODE
(
for
Preventing
Zoonotic
Diseases
Emergence
)
and
the
Geneva-based
,
foundation-funded
I-DAIR
(
for
International
Digital
Health
&
Artificial
Intelligence
Research
Collaborative
)
;
CORDS
(
Connecting
Organisations
for
Regional
Disease
Surveillance
)
,
six
networks
that
cover
Africa
,
Asia
,
and
the
Middle
East
;
Europe
’
s
version
of
the
CDC
,
which
draws
on
27
health
ministries
,
and
the
US
CDC
and
its
international
partners
.
And
then
(
deep
breath
!
)
there
’
s
an
array
of
academic
and
nonprofit
detection
networks
aimed
at
HIV
,
malaria
,
Ebola
,
tuberculosis
,
fungal
diseases
,
antibiotic-resistant
pathogens
,
wildlife
diseases
,
and
on
and
on.In
short
:
The
world
might
not
need
another
surveillance
system
.
The
existing
plethora
is
one
reason
why
the
Rockefeller
Foundation
’
s
recently
announced
Pandemic
Prevention
Institute
instead
proposes
to
create
a
hub
for
aggregating
and
analyzing
data
that
is
held
in
existing
systems
,
rather
than
creating
a
new
one
.
There
hasn
’
t
been
much
detail
released
about
the
new
British
effort
,
but
there
are
indications
that
the
UK
government
is
thinking
along
similar
lines.The
effort
is
supported
by
the
philanthropic
Wellcome
Trust
,
and
in
concept
documents
,
that
organization
recommends
creating
a
super-hub
that
links
existing
networks
while
providing
a
shared
resource
for
sequencing
,
data
analysis
,
and
computing
infrastructure
,
along
with
the
workforce
to
operate
them
.
On
the
day
Johnson
made
his
announcement
,
Jeremy
Farrar
,
Wellcome
’
s
director
,
stated
that
the
plan
would
be
to
create
a
system
that
is
“
locally
owned
[
and
]
internationally
networked.
”
But
let
’
s
get
to
details
:
What
should
a
successful
system
do
?
If
the
world
is
going
to
have
a
new
detection
and
response
network—or
a
network
of
networks
,
or
a
super-network—some
decisions
need
to
be
made
about
its
scope
.
That
way
it
doesn
’
t
end
up
as
just
another
monitoring
system
,
but
has
the
power
to
pinpoint
areas
of
risk
and
to
spin
up
predictions
about
how
the
risk
might
play
out.Caitlin
Rivers
,
an
epidemiologist
and
senior
scholar
at
the
Johns
Hopkins
Center
for
Health
Security
,
has
been
thinking
about
this
issue
for
more
than
a
decade
,
since
working
on
pandemic-prediction
initiatives
for
the
Obama
administration
.
(
Yes
,
better
pandemic
prediction
has
been
under
discussion
at
least
that
long
.
)
She
laid
out
details
last
year
in
a
proposal
for
a
national
center
for
epidemic
forecasting
,
published
in
Foreign
Affairs
,
with
Dylan
George
of
the
intelligence-focused
venture
capital
firm
In-Q-Tel.They
wrote
that
pandemic
prediction
suffers
from
relying
on
academics
who
have
to
justify
their
research
to
grantmakers
,
and
who
can
’
t
necessarily
step
away
when
public
service
needs
their
expertise
.
The
authors
proposed
giving
disease
modelers
financial
support
to
work
out
their
models
in
advance
of
emergencies
,
and
creating
formal
channels
between
them
and
federal
decisionmakers
who
could
call
on
their
work
as
needed—similar
to
what
the
National
Weather
Service
already
does.Rivers
’
and
George
’
s
proposal
was
read
by
the
right
people
.
Five
days
after
President
Joe
Biden
’
s
inauguration
,
the
new
administration
committed
to
creating
a
National
Center
for
Epidemic
Forecasting
and
Outbreak
Analytics
.
In
March
,
they
designated
$
500
million
in
funding
for
it
as
part
of
the
American
Rescue
Plan
Act.Here
’
s
where
the
coming
US
agency
and
the
hoped-for
international
effort
dovetail
:
Their
successes
will
hinge
on
data
:
more
abundant
data
,
more
granular
data
,
just
more
.
In
the
mid-20th
century
,
the
inaccuracy
of
weather
forecasting
was
the
butt
of
late-night
TV
jokes
.
What
made
it
a
reliable
endeavor
was
deploying
data-collection
devices—satellites
,
Doppler
radar
,
weather
balloons
,
automated
surface-observing
systems—and
achieving
the
supercomputer
processing
power
and
graphical
systems
to
understand
and
represent
the
results.The
data-collection
devices
that
could
help
us
scan
the
horizon
for
pandemics
already
exist
.
(
You
might
be
reading
this
on
one
.
)
Mobility
data
,
purchase
records
,
search
terms
,
the
words
you
use
in
tweets—all
represent
information
that
can
fuel
predictive
tools
.
Public
health
doesn
’
t
yet
do
a
good
job
of
accessing
that
data
,
collating
it
,
and
analyzing
it
.
The
channels
for
getting
to
it
haven
’
t
been
carved
out
even
in
rich
countries
.
In
the
Global
South
,
the
problem
is
worse.
“
There
's
so
much
heterogeneity
in
the
underlying
capabilities
of
various
countries
and
places
,
”
Rivers
says
.
Obtaining
that
data
to
help
a
country
ring
alarm
bells
,
let
alone
contribute
to
global
forecasting
,
“
might
even
be
a
matter
of
moving
from
paper
reporting
to
digital
reporting
,
”
she
adds
.
“
It
's
hard
to
see
how
you
can
skip
to
the
end
and
have
an
advanced
radar
system
without
first
attending
to
those
basic
pieces
,
when
each
of
those
pieces
in
each
jurisdiction
is
a
big
undertaking.
”
Take
test
results
,
for
instance
.
It
would
be
desirable
to
plug
in
the
results
of
any
diagnostic
tests
done
during
health
care
visits
,
to
sort
out
whether
a
wave
of
respiratory
infections
is
being
caused
by
a
common
virus
or
a
new
strain
.
But
so
many
people
lack
access
to
health
care
that
diagnostic
data
might
have
limited
predictive
power
.
On
the
other
hand
,
most
people
use
sewage
systems—where
they
exist—and
wastewater
sampling
can
detect
pathogens
without
intruding
on
individual
privacy
or
forcing
the
construction
of
interoperable
record
systems.Animal
data
is
another
gap
.
Structures
already
exist
for
reporting
cases
of
human
disease
and
wildlife
and
livestock
diseases
,
but
they
are
separate
,
run
by
different
United
Nations
agencies
.
Reports
in
one
system
won
’
t
ring
an
alarm
bell
in
another—an
oversight
,
since
so
many
emerging
diseases
are
zoonotic
,
beginning
in
animals
and
then
leaping
to
humans.That
revelation
two
weeks
ago
that
a
coronavirus
carried
by
cats
and
dogs
had
been
found
in
old
throat
swabs
from
people
proves
the
point
.
It
came
to
light
belatedly
,
because
of
an
academic
project
.
These
detections
did
not
get
reported
through
a
notification
system
,
and
there
is
no
indication
that
anyone
has
set
up
anything
new
to
track
the
virus
.
“
We
don
’
t
have
systems
now
that
could
go
keep
an
eye
on
canine
coronaviruses
,
”
Carlson
says
.
“
We
know
that
this
is
a
virus
that
can
recombine
in
such
a
way
that
it
can
transmit
to
humans
.
We
've
seen
it
do
it
,
in
a
really
limited
way
.
We
know
that
is
a
potential
threat
to
health
security
.
But
there
is
no
global
monitoring.
”
The
final
question
a
pandemic
radar
will
face
is
this
:
Who
benefits
?
The
colonialist
model
of
resource
extraction—take
a
commodity
from
the
Global
South
,
use
it
to
benefit
the
Global
North—has
tripped
up
disease
surveillance
before
.
In
2007
,
in
the
midst
of
worldwide
concern
over
the
spread
of
H5N1
avian
flu
,
Indonesia
stopped
sending
viruses
collected
within
its
borders
into
the
WHO
’
s
flu
surveillance
network
.
The
WHO
scolded
the
nation
,
saying
it
was
endangering
the
world
.
The
government
of
Indonesia—which
,
at
the
time
,
had
experienced
more
bird
flu
deaths
than
any
other
country—responded
that
this
was
its
only
possible
leverage
against
inequity
.
If
affluent
countries
used
Indonesian
viruses
to
develop
a
bird-flu
vaccine
,
Indonesia
wanted
guaranteed
,
inexpensive
access—to
not
have
to
compete
to
buy
a
product
that
would
not
have
existed
without
its
help.That
immediate
crisis
faded
,
thanks
to
a
complex
negotiation
between
the
country
and
the
WHO
,
but
the
underlying
issue
of
viral
sovereignty
never
really
went
away
.
It
surfaced
again
after
the
Ebola
epidemic
of
2014
and
in
the
early
days
of
Covid
.
It
’
s
possible
that
fresh
attention
to
the
need
for
global
surveillance
could
become
a
moment
when
Global
South
countries
get
the
assistance
they
deserve
,
not
just
to
collect
their
own
data
but
to
benefit
from
it
as
well.
“
What
we
really
need
is
a
broadly
distributed
,
high-fidelity
,
always-on
surveillance
system
that
empowers
local
organizations
to
collect
information
on
their
own
populations
that
is
relevant
to
them
,
that
generates
ownership
in
their
data
,
that
empowers
them
to
advocate
for
their
community
needs
,
”
says
Samuel
V.
Scarpino
,
an
assistant
professor
at
Northeastern
University
who
directs
its
Emergent
Epidemics
Lab
.
“
This
is
not
something
that
can
be
built
easily
.
But
we
have
a
narrow
window
right
now
,
where
basically
the
whole
planet
knows
that
we
need
to
solve
this.
”
But
that
binary
never
accounted
for
the
many
people
who
wanted
the
shot
but
couldn
’
t
obtain
it
:
because
vaccine
campaigns
didn
’
t
come
to
their
neighborhoods
,
or
lack
of
sick
leave
would
n't
let
them
risk
side
effects
,
or
they
did
n't
meet
eligibility
criteria
in
the
early
days
when
supply
was
limited
.
Now
it
’
s
becoming
clear
that
this
binary
also
excludes
another
enormous
group
:
People
who
received
the
shot
but
were
not
protected
by
it
,
because
their
immune
systems
didn
’
t
manufacture
an
adequate
defense.Millions
of
Americans
are
immunosuppressed
or
immune-compromised
.
That
is
,
they
take
drugs
to
make
sure
that
a
transplanted
organ
is
not
rejected
or
to
tamp
down
the
overactive
immunity
that
produces
rheumatoid
arthritis
and
lupus
;
or
,
alternatively
,
they
have
illnesses
that
undermine
their
ability
to
defend
against
pathogens
.
A
handful
of
research
papers
published
over
the
past
few
months
all
find
the
same
result
:
When
these
patients
receive
Covid
vaccines
,
their
bodies
don
’
t
create
as
many
defensive
antibodies
as
those
of
healthy
people
.
Some
have
contracted
the
disease
despite
being
fully
vaccinated—meaning
that
,
to
protect
themselves
,
they
must
continue
to
behave
as
though
their
vaccinations
never
occurred.As
a
result
,
some
are
seeking
extra
vaccinations
,
arranging
for
third
doses
that
they
hope
will
act
like
booster
shots
.
A
study
published
Monday
in
the
Annals
of
Internal
Medicine
by
a
team
at
Johns
Hopkins
University
School
of
Medicine
documents
the
experience
of
30
people
living
with
organ
transplants
who
sought
out
a
third
shot
in
hopes
of
boosting
their
immune
responses
.
After
their
second
shots
,
none
of
the
30
had
high
antibody
levels
;
in
fact
,
only
six
showed
any
antibody
response
at
all
.
After
the
third
shot
,
14
out
of
30
saw
some
improvement
,
and
12
of
30
had
antibody
levels
that
the
researchers
considered
protective.This
is
an
important
finding—even
though
it
was
made
in
a
small
group
of
self-selected
volunteers
,
something
that
’
s
typically
thought
of
as
a
weak
study
design—because
it
might
point
the
way
to
letting
still-vulnerable
people
rejoin
a
post-Covid
society
.
It
might
also
help
explain
some
of
the
rare
and
not-well-explained
“
breakthrough
”
infections
that
occur
in
a
small
fraction
of
fully
vaccinated
people
.
(
There
was
a
high-profile
cluster
of
breakthrough
infections
last
month
among
people
who
work
for
the
New
York
Yankees
baseball
team
.
No
underlying
conditions
have
been
linked
to
them
.
)
“
What
we
have
found
is
hope
,
”
says
Dorry
L.
Segev
,
the
study
’
s
senior
author
and
a
Hopkins
professor
of
surgery
.
“
A
lot
of
transplant
patients
were
very
excited
about
the
vaccine
,
and
then
they
got
their
antibodies
checked
and
they
were
very
suboptimal
,
and
that
was
frustrating
and
demoralizing
.
We
're
showing
something
can
be
done
about
that.
”
More
in
a
minute
on
the
practicalities
of
third
shots
.
To
understand
why
the
possibility
is
so
alluring—and
sticky
,
in
a
regulatory
sense—it
’
s
worth
looking
first
at
what
researchers
have
sussed
out
about
how
chronic
immune
conditions
complicate
protections
against
Covid.Segev
’
s
team
was
among
the
first
to
tackle
this
issue
.
Last
December
,
one
day
after
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
issued
emergency
use
authorizations
for
the
Pfizer
and
Moderna
vaccines
,
the
Hopkins
group
put
out
a
call
on
social
media
.
They
asked
immune-suppressed
people
to
enroll
in
a
trial
that
would
keep
track
of
their
health
and
document
their
responses
to
the
vaccines
.
They
signed
up
almost
1,000
people
in
the
first
week
,
Segev
says
,
and
have
almost
4,000
in
a
registry
now.In
March
,
the
group
published
the
first
data
from
those
sign-ups
:
Among
436
transplant
recipients
,
only
17
percent
showed
detectable
antibodies
after
one
dose
of
the
Pfizer
or
Moderna
vaccines
.
That
was
discouragingly
low
.
By
contrast
,
every
participant
in
the
mRNA
vaccines
’
clinical
trials—100
percent—demonstrated
antibody
production
by
the
15th
or
21st
day
after
their
first
dose
of
the
vaccine
,
according
to
data
from
the
manufacturers
and
academic
researchers.A
follow-up
Hopkins
study
evaluated
antibody
responses
after
two
doses
in
658
transplant
recipients
from
the
social
media
volunteers
,
396
of
them
participants
from
the
first
group
.
It
yielded
both
good
and
bad
news
.
Good
:
259
members
of
the
study
group
,
39
percent
,
had
no
antibodies
after
their
first
dose
but
gained
them
after
their
second
.
Bad
:
46
percent
of
the
participants
had
no
antibody
responses
at
all.The
Hopkins
group
wasn
’
t
the
only
academic
team
thinking
about
this
problem
.
Soon
after
the
vaccines
became
available
,
physicians
at
Columbia
University
Medical
Center
in
New
York
who
were
taking
care
of
kidney
transplant
patients
became
worried
.
Several
of
their
patients
qualified
for
the
earliest
doses
,
yet
after
completing
their
vaccine
courses
and
passing
their
“
immune
by
”
dates
,
several
of
them
still
came
down
with
Covid
.
Worried
,
the
nephrology
department
staff
began
asking
any
kidney
transplant
recipients
who
received
the
vaccines
to
have
their
antibody
levels
tested
two
weeks
after
their
second
shot
.
By
the
end
of
March
,
28
patients
went
through
that
testing
.
Only
25
percent
of
them
showed
any
antibody
response.This
was
disappointing
,
but
,
immunologically
,
it
makes
sense
.
After
all
,
the
purpose
of
vaccination
is
to
induce
the
body
to
develop
a
protective
response—expressed
in
antibodies
,
along
with
other
immune
system
cells—that
defends
it
against
an
infection
.
But
the
drug
regimens
that
transplant
recipients
take
,
to
keep
their
bodies
from
rejecting
donated
organs
,
suppress
antibody
production
.
That
goal
works
against
what
the
vaccine
is
intended
to
do.
“
Patients
’
immunosuppression
regimens
are
designed
to
blunt
their
immune
response
to
a
new
pathogen
,
because
typically
the
biggest
pathogen
they
're
being
exposed
to
,
so
to
speak
,
is
the
new
kidney
,
”
says
Syed
Ali
Husain
,
an
assistant
professor
of
medicine
at
Columbia
and
first
author
of
an
account
of
the
findings
,
published
in
April
.
“
Their
immunosuppression
regimen
is
designed
to
prevent
antibody
production.
”
It
’
s
important
to
say
here
that
all
these
findings
are
mapping
new
territory
.
In
order
to
get
the
cleanest
,
fastest
authorization
,
people
with
immune
deficits
were
excluded
from
Covid
vaccine
clinical
trials
.
There
was
a
broad
assumption
among
physicians
that
those
patients
would
have
less
response
to
the
vaccines—but
vaccine
manufacturers
didn
’
t
attempt
to
gather
that
data
.
The
run
of
studies
that
began
this
spring
represents
the
first
attempts
to
define
vaccine
effectiveness
,
or
continued
vulnerability
,
for
this
patient
pool.Organ
transplant
patients
aren
’
t
the
only
people
bedeviled
by
low
antibody
counts
after
Covid
vaccination
.
For
instance
,
an
April
analysis
submitted
as
a
preprint
(
so
not
yet
peer-reviewed
or
published
in
a
journal
)
of
how
people
with
blood
and
bone
marrow
cancers
responded
to
two
doses
of
Covid
vaccines
showed
that
46
percent
of
them
made
no
antibodies
.
Some
of
those
patients
had
their
immune
systems
suppressed
by
drug
regimens
,
and
in
others
their
cancers
were
to
blame
for
their
immune
status
.
Patients
with
one
particular
blood
cancer
,
known
as
B-cell
chronic
lymphocytic
leukemia
,
were
even
less
likely
to
make
an
immune
response
:
Only
23
percent
had
detectable
antibodies
,
even
though
most
of
them
were
not
taking
immune-suppressing
drugs
at
the
time.These
low
percentages
feel
unnerving
,
but
they
may
not
tell
the
whole
story
.
Ghady
Haidar
,
the
senior
author
on
that
analysis
and
a
transplant
infectious
diseases
physician
at
University
of
Pittsburgh
Medical
Center
,
says
a
frustration
in
translating
risk
to
patients
is
that
we
still
don
’
t
have
good
metrics—
”
correlates
of
immunity
”
is
the
technical
term—for
what
constitutes
protection
against
Covid
.
That
is
,
researchers
know
what
protective
antibody
counts
look
like
in
healthy
patients
;
but
how
far
below
that
range
an
immune-compromised
person
can
drop
and
still
be
protected
isn
’
t
yet
known.Plus
,
antibodies
are
not
the
only
defense
the
body
deploys
to
create
immunity
:
We
also
make
T
cells
,
memory
B
cells
,
and
others
.
The
vaccine
clinical
trials
didn
’
t
attempt
to
measure
the
cell
counts
required
to
create
an
effective
defense
against
the
virus
.
They
reported
only
clinical
endpoints
,
such
as
whether
someone
became
seriously
ill
or
died
from
the
disease
.
So
focusing
on
antibodies
alone
may
miss
important
parts
of
the
immune
response.
“
I
try
not
to
use
words
like
‘
you
didn
’
t
respond
’
to
the
vaccine
when
someone
isn
’
t
making
antibodies
,
”
says
Haidar
,
who
is
principal
investigator
on
a
larger
study
that
is
recruiting
people
with
a
range
of
immune
deficits
,
including
HIV
,
in
order
to
study
Covid
vaccine
response
.
“
I
worry
that
it
might
drive
vaccine
hesitancy
if
the
messaging
is
that
the
vaccine
is
n't
working
for
you
.
I
think
we
have
to
be
a
little
more
nuanced
to
account
for
the
complexities
that
other
elements
of
the
immune
system
could
have
been
revved
up
by
the
vaccines.
”
Even
in
the
few
studies
done
so
far
,
it
’
s
clear
that
immune
response
to
the
vaccines
varies
,
depending
on
the
age
of
the
patient
,
the
type
of
immune
deficit
they
are
experiencing
,
the
type
of
transplant
they
received
,
the
specific
drugs
they
take
,
the
length
of
time
since
transplant
or
last
dose
,
and
a
host
of
other
factors
.
The
likelihood
of
abundant
antibody
production
appears
higher
,
for
instance
,
in
patients
who
take
immune-suppressing
medications
to
treat
chronic
inflammatory
diseases
than
it
does
in
transplant
and
cancer
patients
.
Studies
done
by
Segev
and
team
show
better
rates
of
antibody
production
in
those
patients
after
one
and
two
doses
.
But
a
separate
preprint
,
done
by
Washington
University
School
of
Medicine
in
St.
Louis
and
UC
San
Francisco
,
shows
a
wide
range
of
responses
depending
on
which
drug
regimen
a
patient
is
taking.That
may
provide
a
clue
for
managing
patients
’
vulnerability
,
so
that
they
can
get
closer
to
the
kind
of
immune
protection
that
otherwise
healthy
people
receive
from
Covid
vaccines
.
“
One
thing
we
are
telling
patients
who
are
in
suppression
,
who
have
n't
gotten
vaccinated
yet
,
is
to
consider
holding
their
medicine
,
”
says
Alfred
H.
J.
Kim
,
that
study
’
s
senior
author
and
an
assistant
professor
of
rheumatology
and
immunology
at
Washington
University
.
“
Obviously
,
if
you
hold
medicines
,
you
risk
flares
.
And
if
you
're
going
to
flare
,
this
could
make
your
vaccine
side
effects
worse
,
or
it
could
make
the
vaccine
itself
less
effective
.
It
’
s
a
really
tricky
situation.
”
And
,
legally
,
doctors
currently
can
’
t
advise
patients
to
seek
extra
doses
of
the
Covid
vaccine
.
The
FDA
has
authorized
only
one
or
two
doses
for
all
the
vaccines
it
has
let
enter
the
US
market
.
For
Segev
’
s
team
’
s
study
,
the
doctors
didn
’
t
prescribe
third
doses—the
patients
found
third
doses
on
their
own
,
in
ways
the
study
did
not
specify
.
The
Hopkins
team
tracked
the
results.Still
,
there
’
s
some
evidence
in
medical
literature
to
support
the
utility
of
additional
doses
.
For
instance
,
the
French
government
has
recommended
a
third
dose
for
anyone
who
is
immunocompromised
.
And
in
the
US
,
it
’
s
been
understood
for
years
that
a
second
dose
of
seasonal
flu
vaccine
and
larger
doses
of
hepatitis
B
vaccine
are
required
to
create
immunity
in
them.But
it
will
be
necessary
to
gather
more
data
to
be
sure
.
The
Hopkins
team
is
contemplating
a
larger
trial
in
which
immunosuppressed
patients
seeking
third
doses
would
be
enrolled
and
tracked
in
a
formal
way
.
And
despite
the
allure
of
higher
protection
,
they
’
re
not
urging
immune-damaged
patients
to
start
freelancing
their
own
third
shots
.
“
There
are
risks
to
taking
third
doses
,
”
Segev
says
.
“
There
is
a
risk
the
third
dose
will
activate
your
immune
system
and
cause
either
an
overt
rejection
or
some
sort
of
subclinical
thing
,
where
you
start
to
develop
a
little
more
antibodies
against
your
transplanted
organ
.
It
's
important
that
people
who
do
go
out
and
get
third
doses
are
either
part
of
research
protocols
or
are
doing
this
in
collaboration
with
their
doctors
who
have
evaluated
the
risks
and
benefits.
”
If
trials
like
this
can
yield
data—another
one
,
recently
announced
,
is
being
conducted
by
the
National
Institutes
of
Health—they
could
do
more
than
let
the
immunocompromised
get
back
to
everyday
life
.
They
could
also
illuminate
aspects
of
the
immune
system
and
its
interaction
with
vaccines
that
are
still
not
very
well
understood
.
And
that
will
be
of
benefit
not
just
during
this
pandemic
but
for
whatever
we
need
to
protect
ourselves
against
next.More
than
a
year
later
,
we
have
multiple
effective
vaccines
,
all
Americans
age
12
or
older
are
now
eligible
to
get
the
shot
,
and
appointments
are
easier
to
come
by
.
To
reflect
this
increasing
hopefulness
,
the
CDC
recently
relaxed
its
guidelines
on
masks
.
Fully
vaccinated
people
can
now
forgo
masks
both
indoors
and
outdoors
(
with
many
exceptions
,
such
as
on
public
transit
)
.But
the
decision
is
befuddling
.
Again
.
Do
we
have
to
prove
we
’
re
vaccinated
?
Do
businesses
have
to
make
new
rules
?
And
if
so
,
who
is
in
charge
of
enforcing
them
?
I
’
m
already
socially
awkward
after
more
than
a
year
in
lonely
isolation
,
and
my
limited
ventures
into
the
outside
world
have
become
even
more
fraught
.
On
one
recent
walk
,
a
neighbor
and
I
stopped
10
feet
away
from
each
other
on
the
sidewalk
and
dug
masks
out
of
our
bags
.
“
I
’
m
vaccinated
!
”
she
shouted
.
“
So
am
I
!
”
I
yelled
back
.
Both
of
us
put
on
our
masks
anyway
and
gave
each
other
embarrassing
,
apologetic
head
nods
as
we
passed
.
I
thought
,
there
has
to
be
a
better
way—so
I
called
some
experts
in
public
health
communications
for
advice.In
the
wake
of
vaccinations
,
celebratory
stickers
,
buttons
,
T-shirts
,
and
bracelets
indicating
you
got
the
shot
(
s
)
have
sprung
up
online
.
It
’
s
easy
to
dismiss
all
this
vaccine
swag
as
opportunistic
profiteering
,
but
these
small
,
joyful
,
and
affordable
homegrown
vaccination
signals
serve
an
important
purpose.For
more
than
a
year
,
face
masks
were
the
first
line
of
protection
we
had
against
a
deadly
disease
,
and
refusing
to
wear
one
was
a
political
signal
.
When
we
see
another
unmasked
person
now
,
we
have
to
just
trust
that
they
’
re
vaccinated
.
After
a
year
of
unrelenting
divisiveness
,
relying
on
the
honor
system
feels
like
a
risky
proposition
.
But
widespread
attention
to
anti-vaxxers
and
the
vaccine-hesitant
can
obscure
the
fact
that
most
people
are
taking
steps
to
protect
themselves
and
others
.
“
The
actual
number
of
people
who
are
refusing
to
comply
[
with
vaccinations
]
is
actually
very
small
,
”
says
Vish
Viswanath
,
the
Lee
Kum
Kee
Professor
of
Health
Communication
at
Harvard
’
s
T.
H.
Chan
School
of
Public
Health
.
Only
20
percent
of
Americans
say
they
won
’
t
get
the
vaccine
(
though
these
polls
were
taken
before
the
Johnson
&
Johnson
vaccine
was
paused
)
.
More
than
131
million
people
in
the
US
have
been
vaccinated
,
and
that
number
is
still
rising
,
though
the
pace
has
slowed.A
few
months
ago
,
signaling
that
you
'd
been
vaccinated
could
backfire
or
open
you
to
scorn
and
charges
that
you
got
the
vaccine
before
other
,
perhaps
more
deserving
people
.
But
now
that
vaccination
appointments
are
much
easier
to
come
by
,
wearing
a
pin
,

norm.
“
You
have
to
have
public
support
,
not
public
confusion
,
”
Viswanath
says
.
If
you
live
in
an
area
where
80
percent
of
the
population
has
been
vaccinated
and
you
walk
into
a
room
full
of
“
I
'm
Vaccinated
”
pins
,
you
might
feel
a
lot
better
about
taking
off
your
mask
.
It
helps
that
a
lot
of
the
swag
is
cute
,
and
it
’
s
a
low-key
,
affordable
way
to
commemorate
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
a
life-changing
year
.
I
picked
up
an
enamel
pin
from
Etsy
,
where
small
,
adorable
vaccination
merch
has
proliferated
.
The
CDC
has
printable
stickers
,
as
well
as
digital
resources
for
posting
your
vaccination
status
on
social
media
.
You
might
also
want
to
check
local
businesses
for
apparel
options
too.When
shopping
for
pins
or
T-shirts
,
try
to
avoid
sporting
slogans
that
are
scolding
or
aggressive
.
“
I
don
’
t
think
being
snarky
helps
,
”
says
Susan
Krenn
,
executive
director
for
the
Johns
Hopkins
Center
for
Communication
Programs
.
“
It
can
be
off-putting
and
just
furthers
the
divides
that
we
’
re
already
feeling
around
masking
and
vaccination
,
and
how
politics
has
come
into
that.
”
Krenn
’
s
job
is
to
work
with
governments
and
communities
to
encourage
people
to
adopt
healthy
behaviors
.
During
the
Covid-19
pandemic
,
those
behaviors
included
masking
and
vaccination
.
“
This
timeline
has
been
incredibly
challenging
,
because
things
change
so
quickly
,
”
Krenn
says
.
“
Even
if
it
’
s
a
year
and
a
half
old
,
it
’
s
a
new
pandemic
.
We
have
to
be
flexible
or
adaptable
as
we
move
forward
.
The
ambiguity
makes
all
of
this
harder.
”
It
’
s
OK
to
err
on
the
side
of
caution
,
Krenn
says
.
There
are
still
many
settings
where
the
mask
mandate
remains
clear
,
such
as
public
transportation
,
health
care
,
and
places
where
large
groups
of
people
congregate
indoors
,
like
churches
.
In
more
ambiguous
areas
,
we
're
all
learning
to
navigate
a
respectful
,
comfortable
language
of
consent
.
I
’
m
vaccinated
,
are
you
?
Do
you
feel
comfortable
taking
off
your
mask
,
or
do
you
feel
comfortable
if
I
do
?
Whichever
way
you
choose
to
talk
about
vaccination
,
stay
respectful
and
remember
that
there
are
valid
reasons
why
people
are
staying
masked
.
Maybe
they
’
re
immunocompromised
or
they
don
’
t
want
to
risk
infecting
unvaccinated
young
children
at
home.Everyone
I
spoke
to
says
there
are
many
instances
where
they
will
continue
wearing
masks
,
especially
in
health
care
or
crowded
settings
.
Even
as
the
CDC
’
s
guidelines
relax
,
wearing
a
mask
doesn
’
t
mean
a
person
is
unnecessarily
paranoid
or
doesn
’
t
believe
in
science.
“
Mask
wearing
shouldn
’
t
necessarily
go
away
,
”
Krenn
says
.
“
Continued
mask-wearing
signals
that
even
if
I
’
m
vaccinated
,
there
may
be
people
around
us
who
aren
’
t
.
This
is
a
preventative
measure
that
we
take
for
people
who
can
’
t
get
vaccinated
.
And
the
pandemic
is
not
over
.
We
’
re
in
great
shape
from
where
we
were
a
while
back
,
but
it
’
s
not
over.
”
When
I
related
my
story
about
my
neighbor
and
our
mask
confusion
,
the
researchers
I
spoke
with
laughed
and
said
that
situation
was
not
as
bad
,
nor
as
uncomfortable
,
as
it
felt
at
the
time
.
“
It
’
s
actually
a
good
thing
that
we
are
being
cautious
about
it
,
”
Viswanath
says
.
“
Most
people
are
like
you
and
this
person
.
We
are
complying
with
public
health
regulations
.
The
messages
have
reached
us
.
We
focus
on
the
fighting
on
airplanes
,
but
most
people
are
doing
the
right
things
.
I
think
it
will
take
some
time
to
get
over
that
discomfort
,
and
that
’
s
perfectly
fine.
”
And
even
if
many
of
us
are
confused
by
the
CDC
’
s
guidance
,
that
does
not
necessarily
mean
it
is
wrong
,
or
that
mask-shaming
anyone—for
wearing
or
not
wearing
one—will
help
move
us
closer
to
the
goal
of
reducing
infections.
“
I
believe
that
the
CDC
's
guidance
was
grounded
in
science
,
”
says
Neil
Maniar
,
director
of
urban
health
in
the
Master
of
Public
Health
program
at
Northeastern
University
.
“
There
’
s
been
a
good
amount
of
recent
research
coming
out
showing
that
the
vaccines
are
far
more
effective
than
even
what
we
initially
believed
,
and
there
is
evidence
that
we
can
start
to
relax
some
of
the
restrictions
for
fully
vaccinated
individuals.
”
But
as
Krenn
stressed
,
the
pandemic
is
n't
over
yet
.
Maniar
says
people
should
not
let
down
their
guard
too
soon
or
there
will
be
another
surge
.
“
The
more
that
we
can
communicate
the
importance
of
the
vaccine
in
an
honest
and
transparent
way
that
can
address
the
concerns
and
try
to
reduce
the
divisiveness
around
this
,
the
greater
the
likelihood
that
we
’
ll
be
able
to
put
this
pandemic
behind
us
once
and
for
all
,
”
he
says.No
,
I
'm
not
angry
,
I
'm
just
disappointed
.
Actually
,
let
's
just
use
this
as
an
opportunity
to
talk
about
magnets
.
Pretty
much
everywhere
you
look
,
there
is
some
device
that
uses
them
,
so
it
's
important
to
at
least
have
a
basic
understanding
of
how
they
work.You
might
think
that
the
magnet
stuck
on
your
refrigerator
is
the
simplest
example
.
Nope
.
Those
are
actually
quite
complicated
.
The
most
basic
magnet
is
an
electromagnet
.
Electric
charges
(
like
positive
protons
and
negative
electrons
)
create
electric
fields
.
But
a
moving
electric
charge
creates
a
magnetic
field
.
You
can
make
electric
charges
move
with
just
a
battery
and
a
wire
.
By
connecting
the
wire
from
one
end
of
the
battery
to
the
other
,
an
electric
current
will
flow
,
which
is
moving
the
charges.If
you
want
to
see
that
this
electric
current
creates
a
magnetic
field
,
next
put
the
wire
over
the
top
of
a
magnetic
compass
.
You
will
see
that
the
needle
will
point
in
a
new
direction
,
like
this
:
You
can
make
the
magnetic
field
even
stronger
by
wrapping
the
wire
around
something
made
of
iron
.
Now
it
’
s
an
electromagnet
.
Here
's
how
to
build
the
whole
thing.If
you
consider
the
magnet
that
's
stuck
on
your
fridge
,
it
does
n't
look
like
it
has
a
battery
or
electrical
current
.
So
how
does
it
create
a
magnetic
field
?
I
'll
be
honest
,
things
start
to
get
complicated
here
.
In
order
to
figure
out
how
this
solid
object
makes
a
magnetic
field
,
we
have
to
go
down
to
the
atomic
level.All
matter
is
made
of
atoms
,
and
atoms
are
made
of
electrons
,
protons
,
and
neutrons
.
All
three
of
these
act
like
tiny
little
magnets
,
and
physicists
characterize
their
properties
using
the
term
“
magnetic
moment.
”
(
Yes
,
even
the
neutral
neutron
has
a
magnetic
moment
.
)
The
total
magnetic
moment
of
an
atom
is
the
vector
sum
of
the
moments
from
all
the
particles
within
it
.
As
an
example
,
let
's
consider
two
different
atoms
,
each
with
two
particles
.
In
the
atom
on
the
left
,
the
magnetic
moments
are
in
opposite
directions
.
They
essentially
cancel
to
make
a
magnetic
field
that
is
,
overall
,
pretty
small
.
But
on
the
right
,
the
magnetic
moments
are
in
the
same
direction
,
so
they
add
together.Most
atoms
have
a
very
low
magnetic
moment
,
but
there
are
some
that
do
produce
a
significant
magnetic
field
.
These
elements
are
called
ferromagnetic
materials—some
examples
are
iron
,
nickel
,
and
cobalt
.
Some
alloys
and
ceramics
(
which
are
not
pure
elements
)
are
also
ferromagnetic.However
,
just
having
a
ferromagnetic
material
does
n't
make
something
a
magnet
.
If
you
grab
an
iron
nail
,
it
might
not
act
like
a
bar
magnet
,
but
it
can
be
turned
into
one
fairly
easily
.
That
’
s
because
in
small
regions
of
a
piece
of
iron
,
nearby
atoms
interact
magnetically
and
cause
their
magnetic
moments
to
align
.
This
region
of
aligned
moments
is
called
a
magnetic
domain
.
If
you
get
all
the
magnetic
domains
pointed
in
the
same
direction
,
the
iron
will
then
act
like
a
magnet.So
,
how
do
you
make
it
happen
?
Simple
:
You
use
another
magnet
.
Putting
a
strong
magnet
near
those
unaligned
domains
will
force
them
to
line
up
.
It
's
actually
possible
to
find
rocks
in
the
ground
that
are
both
ferromagnetic
and
have
their
domains
aligned
.
We
call
these
lodestones
.
They
may
have
been
magnetized
by
the
strong
magnetic
fields
created
during
a
lightning
strike.If
you
grab
a
bunch
of
metal
stuff
around
your
house
,
most
of
it
is
probably
steel
(
an
alloy
made
from
iron
)
or
aluminum
,
copper
,
or
brass
.
Oh
,
and
your
cast
iron
pot
is
of
course
made
of
iron
.
Of
these
,
only
the
iron
and
some
of
the
steel
is
attracted
to
magnets.It
's
important
to
remember
that
magnets
only
interact
with
ferromagnetic
materials
.
If
you
were
indeed
a
magnetic
human
,
only
a
steel
or
iron
spoon
would
stick
to
your
head
.
Silver
ones
would
n't
work.One
of
the
arguments
the
people
in
these
spoon
videos
are
making
is
that
Covid-19
vaccines
have
metal
in
them
.
In
the
Center
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
’
s
list
of
ingredients
for
the
three
Covid
vaccines
given
emergency
use
authorization
in
the
United
States
,
the
agency
specifically
points
out
:
“
All
COVID-19
vaccines
are
free
from
metals
such
as
iron
,
nickel
,
cobalt
,
lithium
,
rare
earth
alloys
or
any
manufactured
products
such
as
microelectronics
,
electrodes
,
carbon
nanotubes
,
or
nanowire
semiconductors.
”
But
the
list
does
show
that
all
three
contain
some
form
of
sodium
,
including
sodium
chloride
or
sodium
acetate
,
and
one
of
them
contains
potassium
chloride
.
Both
potassium
and
sodium
can
be
metals—does
that
mean
there
’
s
some
kind
of
metal
in
there
after
all
?
No
,
writes
Naomi
Ginsberg
,
an
associate
professor
of
chemistry
and
physics
at
UC
Berkeley
.
``
Potassium
and
Sodium
are
only
metallic
in
solid
form
,
but
they
are
not
solid
as
additives
in
the
injected
solution
,
”
she
told
WIRED
in
an
email
.
“
The
individual
ions
are
dispersed
in
the
solution
,
a
liquid
composed
of
mostly
water
and
sparse
,
individual
potassium
and
sodium
ions
,
in
addition
to
the
active
components
of
the
vaccine
.
The
ions
in
this
solution
are
basically
like
dissolved
salts
,
like
are
in
Gatorade
or
Pedialyte
,
which
our
body
needs
to
work
properly
but
which
get
depleted
during
exercise
.
``
And
,
of
course
,
neither
potassium
nor
sodium
is
ferromagnetic
.
They
could
n't
cause
a
magnetic
interaction
with
normal
objects.Don
’
t
those
videos
of
someone
with
a
spoon
on
their
head
prove
that
they
are
magnetic
?
No
,
they
don
’
t
.
You
can
get
an
object—metal
or
not—to
stick
to
human
skin
just
because
our
sweat
makes
us
a
little
sticky
.
(
Some
of
us
are
stickier
than
others
.
)
An
object
with
a
large
,
flat
surface
that
has
a
greater
contact
area
with
the
skin
will
be
more
likely
to
stay
stuck
.
But
no
magnets
are
involved.OK
,
let
’
s
take
iron
.
It
’
s
a
ferromagnetic
material
that
many
people
put
in
their
body
every
day
through
fortified
breakfast
cereals
.
Yes
,
there
’
s
actually
iron
in
most
of
them
,
and
to
prove
it
,
here
is
a
classic
at-home
science
experiment
that
you
can
try
.
Get
your
favorite
cereal
and
grind
it
up
.
Put
it
in
a
cup
with
some
water
.
Then
put
a
magnet
in
.
The
magnet
will
attract
the
bits
of
iron
in
the
cereal
and
you
can
pull
them
out
.
If
you
have
a
super
strong
magnet
,
it
will
work
much
better.Here
's
the
iron
I
was
able
to
harvest
from
some
type
of
cocoa
cereal
that
I
found
in
my
house
.
(
I
put
aluminum
foil
over
the
magnet
so
I
could
easily
remove
the
iron
afterwards
.
)
So
,
there
's
your
metal
.
It
's
good
for
you
.
Also
,
no
matter
how
much
cereal
you
eat
,
it
does
n't
make
you
magnetic.Want

But
70
percent
of
people
27
or
older
will
be
vaccinated
by
the
holiday
,
and
officials
say
the
US
expects
to
hit
those
initial
July

targets
no
later
than
mid-July.Nearly
all
Covid-19

in
the

now
among
people
who
haven

been
vaccinated
,
according
to
a
recent
Associated
Press
analysis
.
Thanks
in
part
to
misinformation
,
vaccination
rates
have
slowed
in
the
US

the

variants
spread
across
the
US
and
around
the
worldTwo
newer
variants
are
gaining
momentum
in
the
US
:
Gamma
(
or
P.1
)
,
which
was
first
detected
in
Brazil
and
Japan
,
and
Delta
(
or
B.1.617.2
)
,
which
was
first
detected
in
India
.
Gamma
is
not
dramatically
more
contagious
,
but
some
research
has
indicated
that
it
is
slightly
more
resistant
to
vaccines
.
Delta
,
meanwhile
,
is
estimated
to
be
50
to
60
percent
more
contagious
than
the
Alpha
variant
first
detected
in
the
UK
and
is
thought
to
cause
more-severe
disease
,
though
vaccines
are
still
effective
against
it
.
The
Delta
variant
is
behind
the
most
recent
wave
of
“
extremely
brutal

outbreaks
in
Africa.What

Reports
indicate
that
Delta

has
been
found
in
nearly
a
dozen
countries
including
the
US
,
and
authorities
in
India
declared
it
a

Writer
Cody
Cassidy
has
a
few
ideas.You
can
’
t
always
get
what
you
want
.
Here
are
some
tips
for
returning
or
exchanging
gifts
and
purchases
that
missed
the
mark.How
will
the
world
change
if
more
people
permanently
work
remotely
?
According
to
one
economist
’
s
predictions
,
22
percent
of
workdays
are
likely
to
take
place
remotely
post-pandemic
,
compared
to
5
percent
beforehand
.
In
response
,
a
spate
of
startups
are
cropping
up
to
serve
a
new
class
of
permanently
remote
and
potentially
nomadic
workers
.
These
ventures
offer
short-term
living
situations
with
full-blown
home
offices
and
schooling
for
kids
who
are
moving
from
place
to
place
.
But
the
truth
is
we
won
’
t
know
what
a
more
remote
post-pandemic
world
looks
like
until
more
people
start
to
return
to
the
office—and
the
ones
who
don
’
t
return
have
a
better
sense
of
what
they
’
re
missing
.
In
the
early
days
of
the
COVID-19
pandemic
in
the
US
,
officials
focused
limited
testing
capacity
on
symptomatic
people
who
had
recently
traveled
to
or
been
in
close
contact
with
someone
who
had
traveled
to
places
with
confirmed
outbreaks
of
SARS-CoV-2
.
A
year
later
,
it
’
s
clear
that
some
proportion
of
viral
transmission—perhaps
as
high
as
50
percent—comes
from
presymptomatic
or
asymptomatic
individuals
,
making
it
difficult
to
trace
transmission
.
In
a
study
published
in
Clinical
Infectious
Diseases
June
15
,
researchers
analyzed
blood
collected
between
January
2
and
March
18
,
2020
,
and
found
antibodies
to
SARS-CoV-2
in
samples
from
nine
people
in
five
US
states
,
meaning
that
the
virus
was
likely
present
in
the
US
in
late
2019
.
“
We
suspected
that
there
were
probably
cases
that
preceded
the
ones
that
were
diagnosed
and
confirmed
.
This
is
very
suggestive
that
there
were
probably
multiple
exposures
prior
to
those
initial
cases
,
”
says
Ashley
St.
John
,
an
infectious
disease
researcher
at
Duke-NUS
Medical
School
in
Singapore
who
was
not
involved
in
the
study
.
The
findings
also
indicate
“
that
we
can
probably
use
serology
to
find
potentially
even
earlier
exposures
in
a
similar
way.
”
In
2018
,
researchers
at
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
and
their
collaborators
across
the
US
started
recruiting
volunteers
for
the
All
of
Us
research
program—the
aim
of
which
is
to
collect
individualized
health
data
from
lots
of
people
over
many
years
with
the
ultimate
goal
of
making
medicine
more
individualized
.
The
study
was
therefore
trekking
along
,
gathering
participants
’
medical
history
and
blood
samples
across
the
US
in
early
2020
when
SARS-CoV-2
showed
up.As
public
health
shutdowns
started
and
recruitment
and
testing
for
longitudinal
studies
paused
,
Keri
Althoff
,
an
epidemiologist
at
the
Johns
Hopkins
Bloomberg
School
of
Public
Health
,
and
her
colleagues
on
the
All
of
Us
team
talked
about
if
they
could
look
in
previously
collected
specimens
to
see
whether
or
not
there
were
antibodies
present
that
would
target
SARS-CoV-2
.
This
line
of
investigation
could
“
help
us
put
together
the
puzzle
about
the
early
days
,
because
that
can
help
us
understand
where
we
can
improve
upon
for
preparedness
for
future
outbreaks
,
”
she
says
.
Researchers
across
the
country
were
simultaneously
developing
tests
to
detect
these
antibodies
,
so
the
All
of
Us
team
created
a
partnership
with
a
group
at
Quest
Diagnostics
and
sent
samples
to
their
clinical
lab
for
antibody
testing
.
They
requested
two
tests
for
each
sample
:
one
for
antibodies
that
target
the
protein
that
surrounds
the
SARS-CoV-2
genome
and
one
for
antibodies
that
target
the
viral
spike
protein
.
Out
of
the
24,079
people
who
gave
blood
specimens
between
January
2
and
March
18
,
2020
,
147
were
positive
for
antibodies
directed
toward
the
nucleocapsid
.
Just
nine
participants
tested
positive
for
antibodies
on
both
tests
.
The
earliest
positive
sample—from
a
participant
in
Illinois
taken
on
January
7—was
collected
more
than
two
weeks
before
the
first
official
case
report
in
the
state
on
January
24
.
The
researchers
also
found
SARS-CoV-2
antibodies
in
people
from
Massachusetts
,
Wisconsin
,
Pennsylvania
,
and
Mississippi
in
samples
collected
before
these
states
had
official
cases
.
“
On
average
,
it
takes
about
two
weeks
for
[
immunoglobulin
G
]
antibodies
to
be
detectable
.
.
.
so
now
we
’
re
talking
about
a
December
24
potential
infection
or
sometime
even
prior
to
that
,
”
explains
Althoff
.
She
adds
that
the
results
corroborate
and
extend
findings
from
a
November
2020
study
led
by
researchers
at
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
that
found
SARS-CoV-2
antibodies
in
blood
collected
from
donors
in
December
2019
and
January
2020
in
California
,
Connecticut
,
Iowa
,
Massachusetts
,
Michigan
,
Oregon
,
Rhode
Island
,
Washington
,
and
Wisconsin
.
“
That
there
were
some
cases
of
COVID-19
prior
to
the
documented
cases
[
is
]
a
reasonable
conclusion
,
based
on
the
fact
that
it
’
s
unlikely
that
we
caught
the
very
first
case
in
many
of
these
locations
,
”
says
Saahir
Khan
,
a
clinician-scientist
at
the
University
of
California
,
Irvine
,
who
did
not
participate
in
the
work
.
Because
the
authors
found
a
very
small
number
of
antibody-positive
individuals
in
this
relatively
large
sample
that
they
tested
,
he
adds
,
it
’
s
possible
that
the
number
of
antibody
positives
that
they
detected
here
are
not
true
positives.
“
When
you
have
a
situation
where
it
’
s
a
very
low
prevalence
,
false
positives
are
something
that
you
wrestle
with
,
”
acknowledges
Althoff
,
but
the
sequential
testing
strategy
of
two
positives
,
the
subsequent
quantification
of
the
antibodies
in
those
samples
,
and
the
simulation
models
that
the
researchers
ran
to
predict
healthcare
use
,
cases
,
and
deaths
all
indicate
that
it
’
s
very
unlikely
that
the
results
are
due
to
error
.
Other
lines
of
evidence
they
could
pursue
in
the
future
,
according
to
St.
John
,
are
neutralization
assays
,
in
which
researchers
mix
antibody-positive
serum
or
antibodies
isolated
from
blood
samples
with
live
virus
and
see
what
happens
.
As
it
is
,
the
results
are
“
very
strongly
suggestive
,
but
a
neutralization
test
would
have
just
really
sealed
the
deal
for
me
,
”
she
says
.
As
for
what
the
results
mean
for
the
origins
of
SARS-CoV-2
in
the
US
,
“
it
’
s
important
to
remember
this
is
a
very
small
sampling
of
what
’
s
happening
in
the
country
at
that
time
,
”
St.
John
explains
.
“
It
could
be
many
more
infections
than
we
anticipated
,
”
she
adds
.
“
It
’
s
a
wake-up
call
in
some
sense
that
we
need
to
improve
our
surveillance
for
detection
of
these
types
of
emerging
infectious
diseases
,
so
that
we
can
catch
more
of
the
early
cases
,
because
it
really
emphasizes
that
we
have
a
small
view
of
what
was
happening.

,
published

in
Clinical
Infectious

,
stemmed
from
a
question
Gregory
Gray
,
an
infectious
disease
epidemiologist
at
Duke
University
,
had
early
in
the
pandemic
,
reports
NPR
.
He
wondered
whether
there
were
other
coronaviruses
already
infecting
people
that
might
one
day
spark
outbreaks
,
and
he
asked
his
graduate
student
,
coauthor
Leshan
Xiu
,
to
design
a
test
that
would
detect
not
just
SARS-CoV-2
,
but
previously
unknown
coronaviruses
as
well.The
team
used
its
diagnostic
test
to
screen
more
than
300
nasal
swabs
taken
from
pneumonia
patients
in
Malaysian
Borneo
in
2018
.
Eight
patients
,
or
2.7
percent
,
showed
evidence
of
prior
exposure
to
a
novel
coronavirus
,
and
seven
were
children
,
Science
reports
.
For
a
previously
undetected
virus
,
“
that
’
s
a
pretty
high
prevalence
,
”
Gray
tells
NPR
.
“
That
’
s
remarkable.
”
Gray
sent
samples
of
the
virus
to
Anastasia
Vlasova
,
an
expert
in
animal
coronaviruses
at
the
Ohio
State
University
,
and
she
found
that
the
virus
was
actually
a
chimera—portions
of
its
genome
matched
a
feline
coronavirus
,
while
another
part
was
similar
to
a
porcine
coronavirus
.
But
the
majority
of
its
genome
was
most
similar
to
two
coronaviruses
previously
isolated
from
dogs
,
and
she
was
able
to
grow
the
virus
in
canine
cell
cultures
.
“
Canine
coronaviruses
were
not
thought
to
be
transmitted
to
people
,
”
Vlasova
tells
NPR
.
“
It
’
s
never
been
reported
before.
”
It
’
s
not
clear
if
the
virus
,
dubbed
CCoV-HuPn-2018
,
caused
the
patients
’
pneumonia
,
and
it
’
s
not
yet
known
if
the
virus
is
capable
of
jumping
from
person
to
person
or
how
an
adult
immune
system
might
react
if
it
did
.
“
We
don
’
t
really
have
evidence
right
now
that
this
virus
can
cause
severe
illness
in
adults
,
”
Vlasova
says
in
a
press
release
.
She
did
find
that
the
virus
had
a
key
mutation—a
deletion—that
isn
’
t
found
in
other
canine
coronaviruses
but
is
found
in
those
that
infect
humans
.
While
it
warrants
further
study
to
determine
if
this
mutation
is
necessary
for
initiating
a
cross-species
jump
,
Vlasova
adds
that
she
“
can
not
rule
out
the
possibility
that
at
some
point
this
new
coronavirus
will
become
a
prevalent
human
pathogen
.
Once
a
coronavirus
is
able
to
infect
a
human
,
all
bets
are
off.
”
Speaking
to
NPR
,
Xumin
Zhang
,
a
virologist
at
the
University
of
Arkansas
for
Medical
Sciences
,
says
,
“
As
the
authors
are
careful
to
say
in
their
paper
,
they
have
not
proven
what
’
s
called
Koch
’
s
postulates
,
”
meaning
they
would
need
to
infect
a
human
with
the
virus
in
order
to
show
that
it
causes
pneumonia
.
Such
an
experiment
would
be
unethical
,
he
adds
,
but
they
could
instead
test
more
samples
to
see
how
common
the
virus
is
in
pneumonia
patients
and
then
use
animal
models
to
test
their
hypotheses.The
pig
study
,
released
as
a
preprint
on
medRxiv
in
March
and
since
submitted
to
a
peer-reviewed
journal
,
identified
a
new
coronavirus
in
serum
samples
from
three
Haitian
children
who
came
to
the
hospital
with
fevers
between
2014
and
2015
.
Researchers
at
the
University
of
Florida
were
able
to
grow
the
virus
in
monkey
cells
,
and
a
genomic
analysis
showed
that
it
closely
matched
known
delta-coronaviruses
in
pigs
.
Coronaviruses
parse
into
four
groups—alpha
,
beta
,
gamma
,
and
delta—and
delta-coronaviruses
were
once
thought
to
only
infect
birds
,
Science
reports
.
But
in
2012
,
one
appeared
in
pigs
in
Hong
Kong
,
thought
to
have
jumped
from
songbirds
.
The
same
virus
caused
a
2014
outbreak
in
swine
in
the
US
,
and
delta-coronaviruses
have
since
been
shown
to
infect
human
cells
as
well
.
The
coronaviruses
most
dangerous
to
humans—SARS-CoV
,
SARS-CoV-2
,
and
MERS-CoV—have
all
been
betas
.
While
delta-coronaviruses
cause
significant
outbreaks
in
animals
,
the
same
has
not
been
true
in
humans
.
Alphas
,
including
the
dog-derived
coronavirus
isolated
in
Malaysia
,
have
also
never
triggered
epidemics
in
humans
,
Texas
A

Benjamin
Neuman
tells
Science
,
“
but
that
doesn
’
t
feel
like
much
comfort
in
the
wild
world
of
viruses.
”
Taken
together
,
the
studies
suggest
that
coronaviruses
are
likely
circulating
in
animals
at
higher
rates
than
previously
thought
.
“
I
think
the
more
we
look
,
the
more
we
will
find
that
these
coronaviruses
are
crossing
species
everywhere

Perlman
,

tells

The
goal
moving
forward

Gray
says
in

,
will
be
to
seek
out
these

that

There
is
a
new
public
health
crises
threatening
the
world
with
the
emergence
and
spread
of
2019
novel
coronavirus
(
2019-nCoV
)
or
the
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
2
(
SARS-CoV-2
)
.
The
virus
originated
in
bats
and
was
transmitted
to
humans
through
yet
unknown
intermediary
animals
in
Wuhan
,
Hubei
province
,
China
in
December
2019
.
There
have
been
around
96,000
reported
cases
of
coronavirus
disease
2019
(
COVID-2019
)
and
3300
reported
deaths
to
date
(
05/03/2020
)
.
The
disease
is
transmitted
by
inhalation
or
contact
with
infected
droplets
and
the
incubation
period
ranges
from
2
to
14
d.
The
symptoms
are
usually
fever
,
cough
,
sore
throat
,
breathlessness
,
fatigue
,
malaise
among
others
.
The
disease
is
mild
in
most
people
;
in
some
(
usually
the
elderly
and
those
with
comorbidities
)
,
it
may
progress
to
pneumonia
,
acute
respiratory
distress
syndrome
(
ARDS
)
and
multi
organ
dysfunction
.
Many
people
are
asymptomatic
.
The
case
fatality
rate
is
estimated
to
range
from
2
to
3
%
.
Diagnosis
is
by
demonstration
of
the
virus
in
respiratory
secretions
by
special
molecular
tests
.
Common
laboratory
findings
include
normal/
low
white
cell
counts
with
elevated
C-reactive
protein
(
CRP
)
.
The
computerized
tomographic
chest
scan
is
usually
abnormal
even
in
those
with
no
symptoms
or
mild
disease
.
Treatment
is
essentially
supportive
;
role
of
antiviral
agents
is
yet
to
be
established
.
Prevention
entails
home
isolation
of
suspected
cases
and
those
with
mild
illnesses
and
strict
infection
control
measures
at
hospitals
that
include
contact
and
droplet
precautions
.
The
virus
spreads
faster
than
its
two
ancestors
the
SARS-CoV
and
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
,
but
has
lower
fatality
.
The
global
impact
of
this
new
epidemic
is
yet
uncertain.The
2019
novel
coronavirus
(
2019-nCoV
)
or
the
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
corona
virus
2
(
SARS-CoV-2
)
as
it
is
now
called
,
is
rapidly
spreading
from
its
origin
in
Wuhan
City
of
Hubei
Province
of
China
to
the
rest
of
the
world
[

.
Till
05/03/2020
around
96,000
cases
of
coronavirus
disease
2019
(
COVID-19
)
and
3300
deaths
have
been
reported
[
2
]
.
India
has
reported
29
cases
till
date
.
Fortunately
so
far
,
children
have
been
infrequently
affected
with
no
deaths
.
But
the
future
course
of
this
virus
is
unknown
.
This
article
gives
a
bird
’
s
eye
view
about
this
new
virus
.
Since
knowledge
about
this
virus
is
rapidly
evolving
,
readers
are
urged
to
update
themselves
regularly.Coronaviruses
are
enveloped
positive
sense
RNA
viruses
ranging
from
60
nm
to
140
nm
in
diameter
with
spike
like
projections
on
its
surface
giving
it
a
crown
like
appearance
under
the
electron
microscope
;
hence
the
name
coronavirus
[

]
.
Four
corona
viruses
namely
HKU1
,
NL63
,
229E
and
OC43
have
been
in
circulation
in
humans
,
and
generally
cause
mild
respiratory
disease.There
have
been
two
events
in
the
past
two
decades
wherein
crossover
of
animal
betacorona
viruses
to
humans
has
resulted
in
severe
disease
.
The
first
such
instance
was
in
2002–2003
when
a
new
coronavirus
of
the
β
genera
and
with
origin
in
bats
crossed
over
to
humans
via
the
intermediary
host
of
palm
civet
cats
in
the
Guangdong
province
of
China
.
This
virus
,
designated
as
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
affected
8422
people
mostly
in
China
and
Hong
Kong
and
caused
916
deaths
(
mortality
rate
11
%
)
before
being
contained
[
4
]
.
Almost
a
decade
later
in
2012
,
the
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
,
also
of
bat
origin
,
emerged
in
Saudi
Arabia
with
dromedary
camels
as
the
intermediate
host
and
affected
2494
people
and
caused
858
deaths
(
fatality
rate
34
%
)
[

]
.In
December
2019
,
adults
in
Wuhan
,
capital
city
of
Hubei
province
and
a
major
transportation
hub
of
China
started
presenting
to
local
hospitals
with
severe
pneumonia
of
unknown
cause
.
Many
of
the
initial
cases
had
a
common
exposure
to
the
Huanan
wholesale
seafood
market
that
also
traded
live
animals
.
The
surveillance
system
(
put
into
place
after
the
SARS
outbreak
)
was
activated
and
respiratory
samples
of
patients
were
sent
to
reference
labs
for
etiologic
investigations
.
On
December
31st
2019
,
China
notified
the
outbreak
to
the
World
Health
Organization
and
on
1st
January
the
Huanan
sea
food
market
was
closed
.
On
7th
January
the
virus
was
identified
as
a
coronavirus
that
had
>
95
%
homology
with
the
bat
coronavirus
and
>
70
%
similarity
with
the
SARS-
CoV
.
Environmental
samples
from
the
Huanan
sea
food
market
also
tested
positive
,
signifying
that
the
virus
originated
from
there
[
7
]
.
The
number
of
cases
started
increasing
exponentially
,
some
of
which
did
not
have
exposure
to
the
live
animal
market
,
suggestive
of
the
fact
that
human-to-human
transmission
was
occurring
[
8
]
.
The
first
fatal
case
was
reported
on
11th
Jan
2020
.
The
massive
migration
of
Chinese
during
the
Chinese
New
Year
fuelled
the
epidemic
.
Cases
in
other
provinces
of
China
,
other
countries
(
Thailand
,
Japan
and
South
Korea
in
quick
succession
)
were
reported
in
people
who
were
returning
from
Wuhan
.
Transmission
to
healthcare
workers
caring
for
patients
was
described
on
20th
Jan
,
2020
.
By
23rd
January
,
the
11
million
population
of
Wuhan
was
placed
under
lock
down
with
restrictions
of
entry
and
exit
from
the
region
.
Soon
this
lock
down
was
extended
to
other
cities
of
Hubei
province
.
Cases
of
COVID-19
in
countries
outside
China
were
reported
in
those
with
no
history
of
travel
to
China
suggesting
that
local
human-to-human
transmission
was
occurring
in
these
countries
[
9
]
.
Airports
in
different
countries
including
India
put
in
screening
mechanisms
to
detect
symptomatic
people
returning
from
China
and
placed
them
in
isolation
and
testing
them
for
COVID-19
.
Soon
it
was
apparent
that
the
infection
could
be
transmitted
from
asymptomatic
people
and
also
before
onset
of
symptoms
.
Therefore
,
countries
including
India
who
evacuated
their
citizens
from
Wuhan
through
special
flights
or
had
travellers
returning
from
China
,
placed
all
people
symptomatic
or
otherwise
in
isolation
for
14
d
and
tested
them
for
the
virus.Cases
continued
to
increase
exponentially
and
modelling
studies
reported
an
epidemic
doubling
time
of
1.8
d
[
10
]
.
In
fact
on
the
12th
of
February
,
China
changed
its
definition
of
confirmed
cases
to
include
patients
with
negative/
pending
molecular
tests
but
with
clinical
,
radiologic
and
epidemiologic
features
of
COVID-19
leading
to
an
increase
in
cases
by
15,000
in
a
single
day
[
6
]
.
As
of
05/03/2020
96,000
cases
worldwide
(
80,000
in
China
)
and
87
other
countries
and
1
international
conveyance
(
696
,
in
the
cruise
ship
Diamond
Princess
parked
off
the
coast
of
Japan
)
have
been
reported
[
2
]
.
It
is
important
to
note
that
while
the
number
of
new
cases
has
reduced
in
China
lately
,
they
have
increased
exponentially
in
other
countries
including
South
Korea
,
Italy
and
Iran
.
Of
those
infected
,
20
%
are
in
critical
condition
,
25
%
have
recovered
,
and
3310
(
3013
in
China
and
297
in
other
countries
)
have
died
[
2
]
.
India
,
which
had
reported
only
3
cases
till
2/3/2020
,
has
also
seen
a
sudden
spurt
in
cases
.
By
5/3/2020
,
29
cases
had
been
reported
;
mostly
in
Delhi
,
Jaipur
and
Agra
in
Italian
tourists
and
their
contacts
.
One
case
was
reported
in
an
Indian
who
traveled
back
from
Vienna
and
exposed
a
large
number
of
school
children
in
a
birthday
party
at
a
city
hotel
.
Many
of
the
contacts
of
these
cases
have
been
quarantined
.
These
numbers
are
possibly
an
underestimate
of
the
infected
and
dead
due
to
limitations
of
surveillance
and
testing
.
Though
the
SARS-CoV-2
originated
from
bats
,
the
intermediary
animal
through
which
it
crossed
over
to
humans
is
uncertain
.
Pangolins
and
snakes
are
the
current
suspects.All
ages
are
susceptible
.
Infection
is
transmitted
through
large
droplets
generated
during
coughing
and
sneezing
by
symptomatic
patients
but
can
also
occur
from
asymptomatic
people
and
before
onset
of
symptoms
[
9
]
.
Studies
have
shown
higher
viral
loads
in
the
nasal
cavity
as
compared
to
the
throat
with
no
difference
in
viral
burden
between
symptomatic
and
asymptomatic
people
[
12
]
.
Patients
can
be
infectious
for
as
long
as
the
symptoms
last
and
even
on
clinical
recovery
.
Some
people
may
act
as
super
spreaders
;
a
UK
citizen
who
attended
a
conference
in
Singapore
infected
11
other
people
while
staying
in
a
resort
in
the
French
Alps
and
upon
return
to
the
UK
[
6
]
.
These
infected
droplets
can
spread
1–2
m
and
deposit
on
surfaces
.
The
virus
can
remain
viable
on
surfaces
for
days
in
favourable
atmospheric
conditions
but
are
destroyed
in
less
than
a
minute
by
common
disinfectants
like
sodium
hypochlorite
,
hydrogen
peroxide
etc
.
[
13
]
.
Infection
is
acquired
either
by
inhalation
of
these
droplets
or
touching
surfaces
contaminated
by
them
and
then
touching
the
nose
,
mouth
and
eyes
.
The
virus
is
also
present
in
the
stool
and
contamination
of
the
water
supply
and
subsequent
transmission
via
aerosolization/feco
oral
route
is
also
hypothesized
[
6
]
.
As
per
current
information
,
transplacental
transmission
from
pregnant
women
to
their
fetus
has
not
been
described
[
14
]
.
However
,
neonatal
disease
due
to
post
natal
transmission
is
described
[
14
]
.
The
incubation
period
varies
from
2
to
14
d
[
median
5
d
]
.
Studies
have
identified
angiotensin
receptor
2
(
ACE2
)
as
the
receptor
through
which
the
virus
enters
the
respiratory
mucosa
[
11
]
.The
basic
case
reproduction
rate
(
BCR
)
is
estimated
to
range
from
2
to
6.47
in
various
modelling
studies
[
11
]
.
In
comparison
,
the
BCR
of
SARS
was
2
and
1.3
for
pandemic
flu
H1N1
2009
[
2
]
.The
clinical
features
of
COVID-19
are
varied
,
ranging
from
asymptomatic
state
to
acute
respiratory
distress
syndrome
and
multi
organ
dysfunction
.
The
common
clinical
features
include
fever
(
not
in
all
)
,
cough
,
sore
throat
,
headache
,
fatigue
,
headache
,
myalgia
and
breathlessness
.
Conjunctivitis
has
also
been
described
.
Thus
,
they
are
indistinguishable
from
other
respiratory
infections
.
In
a
subset
of
patients
,
by
the
end
of
the
first
week
the
disease
can
progress
to
pneumonia
,
respiratory
failure
and
death
.
This
progression
is
associated
with
extreme
rise
in
inflammatory
cytokines
including
IL2
,
IL7
,
IL10
,
GCSF
,
IP10
,
MCP1
,
MIP1A
,
and
TNFα
[
15
]
.
The
median
time
from
onset
of
symptoms
to
dyspnea
was
5
d
,
hospitalization
7
d
and
acute
respiratory
distress
syndrome
(
ARDS
)
8
d.
The
need
for
intensive
care
admission
was
in
25–30
%
of
affected
patients
in
published
series
.
Complications
witnessed
included
acute
lung
injury
,
ARDS
,
shock
and
acute
kidney
injury
.
Recovery
started
in
the
2nd
or
3rd
wk
.
The
median
duration
of
hospital
stay
in
those
who
recovered
was
10
d.
Adverse
outcomes
and
death
are
more
common
in
the
elderly
and
those
with
underlying
co-morbidities
(
50–75
%
of
fatal
cases
)
.
Fatality
rate
in
hospitalized
adult
patients
ranged
from
4
to
11
%
.
The
overall
case
fatality
rate
is
estimated
to
range
between
2
and
3
%
[
2
]
.Interestingly
,
disease
in
patients
outside
Hubei
province
has
been
reported
to
be
milder
than
those
from
Wuhan
[
17
]
.
Similarly
,
the
severity
and
case
fatality
rate
in
patients
outside
China
has
been
reported
to
be
milder
[
6
]
.
This
may
either
be
due
to
selection
bias
wherein
the
cases
reporting
from
Wuhan
included
only
the
severe
cases
or
due
to
predisposition
of
the
Asian
population
to
the
virus
due
to
higher
expression
of
ACE2
receptors
on
the
respiratory
mucosa
[
11
]
.Disease
in
neonates
,
infants
and
children
has
been
also
reported
to
be
significantly
milder
than
their
adult
counterparts
.
In
a
series
of
34
children
admitted
to
a
hospital
in
Shenzhen
,
China
between
January
19th
and
February
7th
,
there
were
14
males
and
20
females
.
The
median
age
was
8
y
11
mo
and
in
28
children
the
infection
was
linked
to
a
family
member
and
26
children
had
history
of
travel/residence
to
Hubei
province
in
China
.
All
the
patients
were
either
asymptomatic
(
9
%
)
or
had
mild
disease
.
No
severe
or
critical
cases
were
seen
.
The
most
common
symptoms
were
fever
(
50
%
)
and
cough
(
38
%
)
.
All
patients
recovered
with
symptomatic
therapy
and
there
were
no
deaths
.
One
case
of
severe
pneumonia
and
multiorgan
dysfunction
in
a
child
has
also
been
reported
[
19
]
.
Similarly
the
neonatal
cases
that
have
been
reported
have
been
mild
[
20
]
.A
suspect
case
is
defined
as
one
with
fever
,
sore
throat
and
cough
who
has
history
of
travel
to
China
or
other
areas
of
persistent
local
transmission
or
contact
with
patients
with
similar
travel
history
or
those
with
confirmed
COVID-19
infection
.
However
cases
may
be
asymptomatic
or
even
without
fever
.
A
confirmed
case
is
a
suspect
case
with
a
positive
molecular
test.Specific
diagnosis
is
by
specific
molecular
tests
on
respiratory
samples
(
throat
swab/
nasopharyngeal
swab/
sputum/
endotracheal
aspirates
and
bronchoalveolar
lavage
)
.
Virus
may
also
be
detected
in
the
stool
and
in
severe
cases
,
the
blood
.
It
must
be
remembered
that
the
multiplex
PCR
panels
currently
available
do
not
include
the
COVID-19
.
Commercial
tests
are
also
not
available
at
present
.
In
a
suspect
case
in
India
,
the
appropriate
sample
has
to
be
sent
to
designated
reference
labs
in
India
or
the
National
Institute
of
Virology
in
Pune
.
As
the
epidemic
progresses
,
commercial
tests
will
become
available.Other
laboratory
investigations
are
usually
non
specific
.
The
white
cell
count
is
usually
normal
or
low
.
There
may
be
lymphopenia
;
a
lymphocyte
count
<
1000
has
been
associated
with
severe
disease
.
The
platelet
count
is
usually
normal
or
mildly
low
.
The
CRP
and
ESR
are
generally
elevated
but
procalcitonin
levels
are
usually
normal
.
A
high
procalcitonin
level
may
indicate
a
bacterial
co-infection
.
The
ALT/AST
,
prothrombin
time
,
creatinine
,
D-dimer
,
CPK
and
LDH
may
be
elevated
and
high
levels
are
associated
with
severe
disease.The
chest
X-ray
(
CXR
)
usually
shows
bilateral
infiltrates
but
may
be
normal
in
early
disease
.
The
CT
is
more
sensitive
and
specific
.
CT
imaging
generally
shows
infiltrates
,
ground
glass
opacities
and
sub
segmental
consolidation
.
It
is
also
abnormal
in
asymptomatic
patients/
patients
with
no
clinical
evidence
of
lower
respiratory
tract
involvement
.
In
fact
,
abnormal
CT
scans
have
been
used
to
diagnose
COVID-19
in
suspect
cases
with
negative
molecular
diagnosis
;
many
of
these
patients
had
positive
molecular
tests
on
repeat
testing
[
22
]
.The
differential
diagnosis
includes
all
types
of
respiratory
viral
infections
[
influenza
,
parainfluenza
,
respiratory
syncytial
virus
(
RSV
)
,
adenovirus
,
human
metapneumovirus
,
non
COVID-19
coronavirus
]
,
atypical
organisms
(
mycoplasma
,
chlamydia
)
and
bacterial
infections
.
It
is
not
possible
to
differentiate
COVID-19
from
these
infections
clinically
or
through
routine
lab
tests
.
Therefore
travel
history
becomes
important
.
However
,
as
the
epidemic
spreads
,
the
travel
history
will
become
irrelevant.Treatment
is
essentially
supportive
and
symptomatic.The
first
step
is
to
ensure
adequate
isolation
(
discussed
later
)
to
prevent
transmission
to
other
contacts
,
patients
and
healthcare
workers
.
Mild
illness
should
be
managed
at
home
with
counseling
about
danger
signs
.
The
usual
principles
are
maintaining
hydration
and
nutrition
and
controlling
fever
and
cough
.
Routine
use
of
antibiotics
and
antivirals
such
as
oseltamivir
should
be
avoided
in
confirmed
cases
.
In
hypoxic
patients
,
provision
of
oxygen
through
nasal
prongs
,
face
mask
,
high
flow
nasal
cannula
(
HFNC
)
or
non-invasive
ventilation
is
indicated
.
Mechanical
ventilation
and
even
extra
corporeal
membrane
oxygen
support
may
be
needed
.
Renal
replacement
therapy
may
be
needed
in
some
.
Antibiotics
and
antifungals
are
required
if
co-infections
are
suspected
or
proven
.
The
role
of
corticosteroids
is
unproven
;
while
current
international
consensus
and
WHO
advocate
against
their
use
,
Chinese
guidelines
do
recommend
short
term
therapy
with
low-to-moderate
dose
corticosteroids
in
COVID-19
ARDS
[
24
,
25
]
.
Detailed
guidelines
for
critical
care
management
for
COVID-19
have
been
published
by
the
WHO
[
26
]
.
There
is
,
as
of
now
,
no
approved
treatment
for
COVID-19
.
Antiviral
drugs
such
as
ribavirin
,
lopinavir-ritonavir
have
been
used
based
on
the
experience
with
SARS
and
MERS
.
In
a
historical
control
study
in
patients
with
SARS
,
patients
treated
with
lopinavir-ritonavir
with
ribavirin
had
better
outcomes
as
compared
to
those
given
ribavirin
alone
[
15
]
.In
the
case
series
of
99
hospitalized
patients
with
COVID-19
infection
from
Wuhan
,
oxygen
was
given
to
76
%
,
non-invasive
ventilation
in
13
%
,
mechanical
ventilation
in
4
%
,
extracorporeal
membrane
oxygenation
(
ECMO
)
in
3
%
,
continuous
renal
replacement
therapy
(
CRRT
)
in
9
%
,
antibiotics
in
71
%
,
antifungals
in
15
%
,
glucocorticoids
in
19
%
and
intravenous
immunoglobulin
therapy
in
27
%
[
15
]
.
Antiviral
therapy
consisting
of
oseltamivir
,
ganciclovir
and
lopinavir-ritonavir
was
given
to
75
%
of
the
patients
.
The
duration
of
non-invasive
ventilation
was
4–22
d
[
median
9
d
]
and
mechanical
ventilation
for
3–20
d
[
median
17
d
]
.
In
the
case
series
of
children
discussed
earlier
,
all
children
recovered
with
basic
treatment
and
did
not
need
intensive
care
[
17
]
.There
is
anecdotal
experience
with
use
of
remdeswir
,
a
broad
spectrum
anti
RNA
drug
developed
for
Ebola
in
management
of
COVID-19
[
27
]
.
More
evidence
is
needed
before
these
drugs
are
recommended
.
Other
drugs
proposed
for
therapy
are
arbidol
(
an
antiviral
drug
available
in
Russia
and
China
)
,
intravenous
immunoglobulin
,
interferons
,
chloroquine
and
plasma
of
patients
recovered
from
COVID-19
[
21
,
28
,
29
]
.
Additionally
,
recommendations
about
using
traditional
Chinese
herbs
find
place
in
the
Chinese
guidelines
[
21
]
.Since
at
this
time
there
are
no
approved
treatments
for
this
infection
,
prevention
is
crucial
.
Several
properties
of
this
virus
make
prevention
difficult
namely
,
non-specific
features
of
the
disease
,
the
infectivity
even
before
onset
of
symptoms
in
the
incubation
period
,
transmission
from
asymptomatic
people
,
long
incubation
period
,
tropism
for
mucosal
surfaces
such
as
the
conjunctiva
,
prolonged
duration
of
the
illness
and
transmission
even
after
clinical
recovery.Isolation
of
confirmed
or
suspected
cases
with
mild
illness
at
home
is
recommended
.
The
ventilation
at
home
should
be
good
with
sunlight
to
allow
for
destruction
of
virus
.
Patients
should
be
asked
to
wear
a
simple
surgical
mask
and
practice
cough
hygiene
.
Caregivers
should
be
asked
to
wear
a
surgical
mask
when
in
the
same
room
as
patient
and
use
hand
hygiene
every
15–20
min.The
greatest
risk
in
COVID-19
is
transmission
to
healthcare
workers
.
In
the
SARS
outbreak
of
2002
,
21
%
of
those
affected
were
healthcare
workers
[
31
]
.
Till
date
,
almost
1500
healthcare
workers
in
China
have
been
infected
with
6
deaths
.
The
doctor
who
first
warned
about
the
virus
has
died
too
.
It
is
important
to
protect
healthcare
workers
to
ensure
continuity
of
care
and
to
prevent
transmission
of
infection
to
other
patients
.
While
COVID-19
transmits
as
a
droplet
pathogen
and
is
placed
in
Category
B
of
infectious
agents
(
highly
pathogenic
H5N1
and
SARS
)
,
by
the
China
National
Health
Commission
,
infection
control
measures
recommended
are
those
for
category
A
agents
(
cholera
,
plague
)
.
Patients
should
be
placed
in
separate
rooms
or
cohorted
together
.
Negative
pressure
rooms
are
not
generally
needed
.
The
rooms
and
surfaces
and
equipment
should
undergo
regular
decontamination
preferably
with
sodium
hypochlorite
.
Healthcare
workers
should
be
provided
with
fit
tested
N95
respirators
and
protective
suits
and
goggles
.
Airborne
transmission
precautions
should
be
taken
during
aerosol
generating
procedures
such
as
intubation
,
suction
and
tracheostomies
.
All
contacts
including
healthcare
workers
should
be
monitored
for
development
of
symptoms
of
COVID-19
.
Patients
can
be
discharged
from
isolation
once
they
are
afebrile
for
atleast
3
d
and
have
two
consecutive
negative
molecular
tests
at
1
d
sampling
interval
.
This
recommendation
is
different
from
pandemic
flu
where
patients
were
asked
to
resume
work/school
once
afebrile
for
24
h
or
by
day
7
of
illness
.
Negative
molecular
tests
were
not
a
prerequisite
for
discharge.At
the
community
level
,
people
should
be
asked
to
avoid
crowded
areas
and
postpone
non-essential
travel
to
places
with
ongoing
transmission
.
They
should
be
asked
to
practice
cough
hygiene
by
coughing
in
sleeve/
tissue
rather
than
hands
and
practice
hand
hygiene
frequently
every
15–20
min
.
Patients
with
respiratory
symptoms
should
be
asked
to
use
surgical
masks
.
The
use
of
mask
by
healthy
people
in
public
places
has
not
shown
to
protect
against
respiratory
viral
infections
and
is
currently
not
recommended
by
WHO
.
However
,
in
China
,
the
public
has
been
asked
to
wear
masks
in
public
and
especially
in
crowded
places
and
large
scale
gatherings
are
prohibited
(
entertainment
parks
etc
)
.
China
is
also
considering
introducing
legislation
to
prohibit
selling
and
trading
of
wild
animals
[
32
]
.The
international
response
has
been
dramatic
.
Initially
,
there
were
massive
travel
restrictions
to
China
and
people
returning
from
China/
evacuated
from
China
are
being
evaluated
for
clinical
symptoms
,
isolated
and
tested
for
COVID-19
for
2
wks
even
if
asymptomatic
.
However
,
now
with
rapid
world
wide
spread
of
the
virus
these
travel
restrictions
have
extended
to
other
countries
.
Whether
these
efforts
will
lead
to
slowing
of
viral
spread
is
not
known.A
candidate
vaccine
is
under
development.At
the
time
of
writing
this
article
,
the
risk
of
coronavirus
in
India
is
extremely
low
.
But
that
may
change
in
the
next
few
weeks
.
Hence
the
following
is
recommended
:
Healthcare
providers
should
take
travel
history
of
all
patients
with
respiratory
symptoms
,
and
any
international
travel
in
the
past
2
wks
as
well
as
contact
with
sick
people
who
have
travelled
internationally.They
should
set
up
a
system
of
triage
of
patients
with
respiratory
illness
in
the
outpatient
department
and
give
them
a
simple
surgical
mask
to
wear
.
They
should
use
surgical
masks
themselves
while
examining
such
patients
and
practice
hand
hygiene
frequently.Suspected
cases
should
be
referred
to
government
designated
centres
for
isolation
and
testing
(
in
Mumbai
,
at
this
time
,
it
is
Kasturba
hospital
)
.
Commercial
kits
for
testing
are
not
yet
available
in
India.Patients
admitted
with
severe
pneumonia
and
acute
respiratory
distress
syndrome
should
be
evaluated
for
travel
history
and
placed
under
contact
and
droplet
isolation
.
Regular
decontamination
of
surfaces
should
be
done
.
They
should
be
tested
for
etiology
using
multiplex
PCR
panels
if
logistics
permit
and
if
no
pathogen
is
identified
,
refer
the
samples
for
testing
for
SARS-CoV-2.All
clinicians
should
keep
themselves
updated
about
recent
developments
including
global
spread
of
the
disease.Non-essential
international
travel
should
be
avoided
at
this
time.People
should
stop
spreading
myths
and
false
information
about
the
disease
and
try
to
allay
panic
and
anxiety
of
the
public.This
new
virus
outbreak
has
challenged
the
economic
,
medical
and
public
health
infrastructure
of
China
and
to
some
extent
,
of
other
countries
especially
,
its
neighbours
.
Time
alone
will
tell
how
the
virus
will
impact
our
lives
here
in
India
.
More
so
,
future
outbreaks
of
viruses
and
pathogens
of
zoonotic
origin
are
likely
to
continue
.
Therefore
,
apart
from
curbing
this
outbreak
,
efforts
should
be
made
to
devise
comprehensive
measures
to
prevent
future
outbreaks
of
zoonotic
origin.None.Publisher

One
vaccine
dose
can
nearly
halve
transmission
riskA
single
dose
of
the
COVID-19
vaccine
made
by
either
Pfizer
or
AstraZeneca
cuts
a
person
’
s
risk
of
transmitting
SARS-CoV-2
to
their
closest
contacts
by
as
much
as
half
,
according
to
an
analysis
of
more
than
365,000
households
in
the
United
Kingdom.Although
the
vaccines
have
been
shown
to
reduce
COVID-19
symptoms
and
serious
illness
,
their
ability
to
prevent
coronavirus
transmission
has
been
unclear
.
Kevin
Dunbar
,
Gavin
Dabrera
and
their
colleagues
at
Public
Health
England
in
London
looked
for
cases
in
which
someone
became
infected
with
SARS-CoV-2
after
receiving
a
dose
of
either
vaccine

.
They
then
assessed
how
often
those
individuals
transmitted
the
virus
to
household
contacts.The
team
found
that
people
who
had
been
vaccinated
for
at
least
21
days
could
still
test
positive
for
the
virus
.
But
viral
transmission
from
these
individuals
to
others
in
their
households
was
40–50
%
lower
than
transmission
in
households
in
which
the
first
person
to
test
positive
had
not
been
vaccinated
.
Results
for
the
two
vaccines
were
similar

findings

inequalitiesIn
Santiago
,
COVID-19
dealt
the
hardest
blow
to
people
with
low
socioeconomic
status
,
because
of
factors
such
as
crowded
households
,
a
lack
of
health
care
and
an
inability
to
work
from
home.Death
rates
were
greater
in
low-income
areas
of
Santiago
,
especially
among
people
under
age
80
,
than
in
high-income
areas
,
according
to
research
by
Gonzalo

,
at
the

.
The
team
found
several
explanations
for
this
disparity
.
Compared
with
higher-income
areas
,
lower-income
neighborhoods
had
high
rates
of
positive
SARS-CoV-2
tests
.
This
suggests
that
testing
there
was
inadequate
—
and
therefore
that
efforts
based
on
case
numbers
to
curb
the
epidemic
couldn
’
t
be
appropriately
targeted.Low-income
areas
had
one-quarter
as
many
hospital
beds
per
10,000
people
as
did
wealthy
areas
.
And
a
striking
90
%
of
COVID-19
deaths
in
lower-income
areas
occurred
outside
of
health-care
facilities
,
compared
with
55
%
in
a
more
affluent
area
of
the
capital.Finally
,
by
using
location
data
from
mobile
phones
,
the
team
found
that
people
in
low-income
areas
moved
more
during
periods
when
residents
were
supposed
to
stay
at
home
—
possibly
because
more
people
had
jobs
outside
of
the
house.Two

Self-taken

Regular

of
a

quickly
detects
the

,
even
in

September

(

.
The
study
found
that
,
during
that
time
,
the
SARS-CoV-2
infection
rate
dipped
as
low
as
0.04
%
in
the
tested
population
—
down
from
around
5
%
in
early
2020
at
the
height
of

—
and
then
began
climbing
to
a
peak
of
about
0.13
%
in
the
final
round
of
testing.Prevalence
rates
early
in
the
second
wave
were
highest
among
young
adults

18–24
,
at
0.25
%
,
compared
with
0.04
%
among
those
aged

This
suggests
that
increased

probably
drove
the
resurgence
.
These
age
patterns
were
not
reflected
in

which
underestimated
infection

How
to
predict
a
vaccine
’
s
success
without
a
large
trialModerna
’
s
vaccine
provides
protection
against
COVID-19
by
triggering
the
production
of
antibodies
against
a
key
viral
protein
,
a
study
in
monkeys
suggests
.
The
insight
—
if
confirmed
in
humans
—
could
speed
the
development
of
next-generation
vaccines.Vaccines
can
trigger
diverse
immune
responses
,
including
the
manufacture
of
antibody
molecules
that
bind
and
block
infectious
viruses
,
and
the
activation
of
T
cells
that
kill
virus-infected
cells
.
By
identifying
the
immune
responses
that
can
predict
a
vaccine
’
s
success
,
scientists
could
more
easily
judge
candidate
vaccines.To

.
The
vaccinated
animals
that
had
the
lowest
levels
of
viral
genetic
material
in
their
noses
and
lungs
also
had
the
highest
levels
of
antibodies

recognize
the
viral
spike
protein

the
molecule
that

.
Levels

The

with

COVID-causing
viruses
are
mixing
in
infected
people
’
s
cellsDifferent
lineages
of
SARS-CoV-2
have
been
spotted
mixing
their
genomes
together
through
a
process
called
recombination.Recombination
occurs

material

While

,
Ben
Jackson
at
the
University

and

detected
several
lineages
that
arose
through
recombination
,
which
is

Preprint

.All
the
lineages
were
products
of
recombination
between
the
fast-spreading
B.1.1.7
lineage
,
which
contains
22
distinguishing
mutations
and
started
to
become
the
dominant
UK
strain
in
late

,
and
other
lineages
circulating
in
the
country
.
The
team
found
evidence
that
four
of
the
eight
lineages
identified
had
spread
between
individuals.Six
of
the
recombinant
lineages
contain
the
version
of
the
spike
gene
—
which
encodes
the
protein
that
the

uses
to
enter

cells
—

This
version
of

harbours
mutations

might

the
researchers
stress
that
there

A

hits

cityA
coronavirus

in
the
Brazilian
city
of
Manaus
might
be
driving
reinfections
and
the
city
’
s
second

of
COVID-19.During
the
first
wave

,
Manaus
experienced
one
of
the

highest
infection
rates
:
an
estimated
two-thirds
of
residents
were
infected
by
October
2020
,
leading
some
researchers
to
predict
that
population-wide
immunity
might
cause
new
infections
to
tail
off
.
But
in
January
2021
,
researchers
identified
a
novel
coronavirus
variant
,
called
P.1
,
during
a
period
of
rising
hospitalizations
in

linked
the

The
variant
harbours
17
mutations
that
alter

proteins
.
Among
the
alterations
are
changes
in
the
SARS-CoV-2

protein
that

immune
evasion.By
modelling
the
spread
of
P.1
and
its
possible
effects
during

,
the
researchers
estimated
that
the
variant
was
1.4–2.2
times

that

the

sloughed
off
small

changes

snips
out
a
stretch

the

identified
more
than
1,000
viruses
with
deletions
in
the
genomic
region
that
encodes
a
protein
called
spike

The

uses
the

protein
to
invade
cells.Further
analysis
showed
that
the
deletions
tended
to
crop
up
at
a
few
distinct
sites
in
the
genomic
region

for
spike

Some
of
the
deletions
have
arisen

some
show
evidence

spread

not

The

little

But
after

An

’

‘

Scientists
have
engineered
an
antibody
that
effectively
disables

and
closely
related
coronaviruses.Laura
Walker
at

biopharmaceutical
company
Adimab
in

isolated
antibodies
from
the

who
had
recovered
from

SARS-CoV

(

.
By
tinkering
with
the
structure
of
the
antibodies
,
the
researchers
created
one
,
called
ADG-2
,
that
was
particularly
effective
at
disabling
SARS-CoV-2
in
a
lab
dish.The
engineered
antibody
also
disabled
a
variety
of
related
coronaviruses.When
given
to
mice
,
it
stopped
SARS-CoV-2
from
reproducing
in
the
rodents
’
lungs
and
protected
the
animals
from
respiratory
disease.Experiments
showed
that
ADG-2
targets
receptors
found
on
the
surface
of
SARS-CoV-2
and
a
range
of
similar
coronaviruses
.
The
authors
dub
this
receptor
the
Achilles
heel
of
coronaviruses
closely
related
to

,
and
suggest
that
this
vulnerability
could
be
exploited

Both

carry
RNA
instructions
that
prompt
human

This
causes
the

3–14

the

But
some

only
one-third

The

of
one
African
nation

s
low
COVID

tollOne
of
the
first
large
SARS-CoV-2
antibody
studies
in
Africa
suggests
that
by
mid-2020
,
the
virus
had
infected
4
%
of
people
in
Kenya
—
a
surprisingly
high
figure
in
view
of
Kenya
’
s
small
number
of
COVID
deaths.The
presence
of
antibodies
against
SARS-CoV-2
indicates
a
history
of
infection

Sophie

searched
for

.
Based
on
those
samples
,
the
researchers
estimate
that
4.3
%
of
Kenya
’
s
people
had
a
history
of
SARS-CoV-2
infection.The
team
’
s
estimate
of
antibody
prevalence
in
Kenya
is
similar
to
an
earlier
estimate
for
the
level
in
Spain

Spain
had
lost
more

that

contrast
”
between

prevalence

wards

can
inactivate

Nearly
half
of

from
people

three-quarters
of
incidents

viral
particles
to
infect

and
a

that
become
active
inside

.
But
scientists
were
uncertain
whether
the

had
more
than
those

If

has
been
implicated

A

mutation

tied

less
severe
illnessA
SARS-CoV-2
mutation
that
appeared
in
East
Asia
early
in
the
pandemic
is
linked
to
symptoms
milder
than
those
caused
by
the
unmutated
version

to
thwart
potent

blood
of
many
people

immune-system
molecules
called

Most
such

recognize
the

the

uses
to
infect

most

This
analysis
shows
that
horseshoe
bats
(
Rhinolophus
spp
.
)
host
an
expanding
lineage
of
viruses
that
,
like
SARS-CoV-2
,
can
infect
humans
.
The
team
estimates
that
the
ancestor
of
SARS-CoV-2
split
40
to
70
years
ago
from
the
closely
related
bat
virus
RaTG13
.
Though
the
two
viruses
are
highly
similar
genetically
,
RaTG13
doesn
’
t
infect
humans
.
Mystery
deepens
over
animal
source
of

The
analysis
also
suggests
that
viruses
in
the
lineage
are
ready
to
jump
to
humans
directly
from
bats
.
But
SARS-CoV-2
might
have
first
hopped
to
another
species
that
humans
are
more
exposed
to
,
rather
than
spreading
straight

The
2019
coronavirus
is
one
of
hundreds
we
know
of
,
and
one
of
seven
known
to
infect
humans
.
These
viruses
affect
the
lungs
and
also
cause
fever
and
sometimes
gastrointestinal
problems
.
The
World
Health
Organization
declared
the
coronavirus
situation
a
global
emergency
in
January
2020
and
a
pandemic
in
mid-March
.
The
pandemic
will
likely
end
,
but
some
experts
now
say
it
's
possible
the
virus
will
become
endemic
and
stick
around
in
a
less
lethal
form
.
We
do
n't
know
exactly
when
and
how
the
virus
jumped
from
bats
to
humans
,
though
efforts
are
underway
to
trace
SARS-CoV-2
back
to
its
origins.The
most
common
symptoms
of
Covid-19
are
dry
cough
,
fever
,
and
shortness
of
breath
.
Others
include
diarrhea
and
loss
of
smell
or
taste
.
Some
people
develop
severe
blood
clots
.
The
disease
is
mercurial—fairly
mild
for
some
and
fatal
for
others
.
Scientists
can
’
t
say
definitively
why
,
but
women
are
less
likely
to
die
than
men
.
We
know
that
older
people
,
especially
those
with
underlying
health
issues
,
are
more
at
risk
.
And
children
fare
better
than
adults
,
but
for
babies
,
toddlers
,
and
kids
with
other
conditions
the
disease
can
be
severe
.
On
the
long
road
to
recovery
,
people
have
experienced
``
brain
fog
''
,
heart
issues
,
and
a
spate
of
other
long-haul
problems.Social
distancing
is
about
staying
away
from
other
people
for
long
enough
to
slow
the
spread
of
the
virus
.
When
you
do
have
to
be
near
others
,
like
at
the
grocery
store
,
while
delivering
food
,
or
going
for
a
walk
,
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
recommends
staying
6
feet
away
.
To
enforce
this
,
many
states
have
implemented
shelter-in-place
orders
at
points
throughout
the
pandemic
.
As
places
have
started
to
reopen—and
rolled
back
reopening
plans—everyone
has
questions
about
what
's
safe
.
You
should
still
avoid
travel
,
especially
by
airplane
.
Scientists
are
still
trying
to
figure
out
exactly
how
the
virus
spreads
through
air
,
especially
in
dense
cities
.
To
navigate
life
amidst
the
pandemic
,
some
public
health
experts
have
also
made
color-coded
guides
.
But
there
's
no
foolproof
way
to
calculate
risk
.
The
only
way
to
avoid
spreading
Covid-19
is
to
follow
all
of
the
public
health
guidelines
we
have
as
much
as
possible.We
now
know
that
you
're
far
more
likely
to
get
coronavirus
from
shared
air
than
a
shared
surface
.
That
said
,
it
's
not
a
bad
idea
to
regularly
clean
and
disinfect
high-touch
belongings
and
surfaces
like
doorknobs
,
remote
controls
,
and
counters
.
One
of
the
most
important
things
you
can
do
,
of
course
,
is
wash
your
hands
!
You
’
ll
want
soap
or
disinfectant
.
You
can
also
make
your
own
sanitizer
at
home.The
CDC
recommends
wearing
a
mask
if
not
doubling
up
in
public
places
where
social
distancing
measures
are
hard
to
maintain
.
They
're
a
must-have
,
and
here
area
few
of
our
favorites
.
When
you
're
stocking
up
,
remember
that
not
all
masks
were
created
equal
.
You
should
layer
a
disposable
surgical
mask
beneath
a
fabric
face
covering
.
Here
are
our
tips
for
making
a
cloth
outer
mask—all
you
need
are
a
t-shirt
and
two
rubber
bands.All
viruses
mutate
over
time
,
as
they
spread
from
person
to
person
.
The
novel
coronavirus
is
no
exception
,
but
recently
several
new
strains
have
emerged
that
seem
to
be
more
infectious
.
The
good
news
is
that
,
so
far
,
the
vaccines
we
have
are
still
effective
enough
at
protecting
against
these
new
variants
.
And
not
all
variants
are
cause
for
alarm
.
As
scientists
boost
genetic
sequencing
to
trace
these
and
other
mutations
more
effectively
and
vaccination
drives
continue
,
the
advent
of
these
strains
means
it
's
more
important
than
ever
to
abide
by
social
distancing
guidelines.At
times
,
especially
over
the
holidays
,
many
people
have
operated
on
the
assumption
that
a
negative
test
means
it
's
safe
to
gather
with
others
.
But
as
we
know
from
last
fall
's
superspreader
event
at
the
White
House
,
we
need
to
do
more
than
just
test
to
keep
the
virus
from
spreading
.
And
even
the
test
results
themselves
do
n't
necessarily
account
for
the
nuances
of
the
disease.At
the
moment
,
there
’
s
no
definitive
treatment
for
Covid-19
.
Some
researchers
investigated
chloroquine
,
the
malaria
drug
touted
by
President
Trump
,
but
there
's
no
evidence
that
it
's
a
viable
treatment
.
Others
looked
into
using
an
anti-influenza
drug
and
Crispr
to
treat
the
disease
.
The
antiviral
Remdesivir
may
also
be
helpful
,
though
expensive
.
The
hope
is
that
research
will
find
old
drugs
effective
for
treating
Covid-19
,
thereby
simplifying
the
drug
discovery
process
.
All
in
all
,
though
,
Covid-19
drug
research
has
proven
to
be
pretty
messy.For
the
time
being
,
generic
drugs
could
be
helpful
for
those
battling
Covid-19
.
Blood
from
recovered
patients
is
also
promising
.
Though
we
do
n't
know
exactly
how
effective
it
is
,
and
getting
it
to
those
in
need
is
a
challenge
,
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
has
OK
'd
its
emergency
use
.
Researchers
are
also
investigating
antibodies
from
the
rare
people
who
seem
to
have
strong
defenses
naturally
in
place
.
And
AI
is
being
used
to
accelerate
everything
from
diagnosis
to
drug
discovery
.
Most
of
all
,
it
’
s
important
to
remember
that
finding
treatments
takes
time
,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
dubious
theories
circulating
online
.
Whatever
you
do
,
please
do
n't
try
drinking
bleach.In
December
,
the
US
approved
its
first
two
Covid-19
vaccines
,
from
Pfizer-BioNTech
and
Moderna
.
This
was
a
blazingly
fast
scientific
achievement
,
all
the
more
so
when
you
consider
that
both
are
the
first-ever
approved
vaccines
that
use
mRNA
to
train
the
immune
system
to
recognize
and
fight
off
SARS-CoV-2
.
Though
very
few
serious
adverse
reactions
have
been
reported
,
many
people
experience
side
effects
,
typically
a
day
or
two
of
feverlike
symptoms
.
The
fact
that
these
vaccines
were
authorized
for
emergency
use
could
have
some
bearing
on
the
fate
of
their
ongoing
trials
.
And
now
that
they
've
been
approved
for
use
in
adults
,
trials
for
use
in
teens
and
tweens
are
underway
.
In
late
February
,
the
FDA
also
approved
a
third
vaccine
,
from
Johnson
&
Johnson
.
Though
it
paused
the
vaccine
's
use
for
a
short
time
in
April
due
to
concerns
about
rare
blood
clots
,
the
shot
is
now
back
in
use
,
as
its
benefits
outweigh
the
risks.Meanwhile
,
trials
for
a
number
of
other
vaccines
are
ongoing
.
This
is
a
good
thing
:
We
'll
need
many
vaccines
to
inoculate
everyone
,
and
it
's
always
possible
that
vaccines
in
trials
now
may
prove
even
better
than
the
ones
we
already
have
.
Now
that
more
and
more
new
variants
are
emerging
,
research
has
also
begun
to
figure
out
how
to
update
existing
shots.Where
rollout
is
concerned
,
two
questions
have
loomed
large
:
What
order
should
people
get
the
vaccine
in
,
and
how
can
they
get
vaccinated
as
efficiently
as
possible
?
Two
of
the
three
shots
approved
for
use
in
the
US
right
now
,
from
Pfizer-BioNTech
and
Moderna
,
require
two
doses
and
must
be
stored
at
very
cold
temperatures
,
two
factors
that
have
complicated
distribution
.
There
's
also
the
issue
of
supply
.
So
far
,
many
Americans
have
had
difficulty
figuring
out
when
they
're
eligible
and
scheduling
an
appointment
.
Some
experts
have
floated
the
idea
of
setting
up
mass
vaccination
clinics
,
but
even
this
would
n't
fully
address
issues
of
equity
and
access
.
Distribution
plans
disproportionately
favor
people
with
time
and
internet
access
,
often
sidelining
those
most
in
need
.
On
top
of
all
this
,
there
's
the
importance
of
building
trust
among
the
vaccine-hesitant
,
especially
within
communities
that
have
historically
borne
the
brunt
of
medical
racism
.
For
the
pandemic
to
truly
end
,
even
vaccinated
people
need
to
take
precautions
and
everyone
worldwide
will
need
access
to
vaccines.Whether
you
’
re
raising
a
family
or
living
alone
,
it
’
s
best
to
isolate
at
home
and
keep
your
space
clean
.
And
whether
you
’
re
sick
or
healthy
,
it
’
s
important
to
look
after
your
mind
and
body.We
know
that
the
virus
is
passed
from
person
to
person
when
someone
coughs
or
sneezes
.
Germy
dust
could
also
be
a
disease
vector
.
Outbreaks
spread
exponentially
at
first
but
that
rate
slows
over
time
,
especially
if
additional
measures
are
taken
to
flatten
the
curve
.
And
some
researchers
are
exploring
the
possibility
that
the
virus
could
return
seasonally
like
the
common
cold
.
Flu
season
was
a
nonevent
during
the
pandemic
,
which
means
that
our
measures
for
curbing
spread
work
,
and
also
that
[
future
flu
seasons
]
(
https
:
//www.wired.com/story/covid-lockdowns-prevented-other-infections-is-that-good/
)
could
be
worse
than
we
're
used
to.Some
countries
opted
for
strict
lockdowns
.
Others
,
like
South
Korea
,
Singapore
,
and
Taiwan
,
seemed
to
have
squashed
the
curve
early
on
thanks
to
widespread
testing
and
tracing
efforts
.
Though
travelers
coming
from
the
US
and
Europe
later
spurred
an
increase
of
cases
,
there
’
s
still
a
lot
for
the
US
to
learn
.
As
far
as
disseminating
information
,
censorship
and
misinformation
have
proven
to
be
issues
worldwide.To
build
useful
models
and
fully
understand
the
coronavirus
,
we
need
to
know
how
it
has
spread
.
Lots
of
countries
are
either
using
smartphone
apps
and
location
data
to
track
the
spread
of
the
virus
or
are
working
to
put
a
contact
tracing
system
in
place
.
To
mitigate
concern
that
this
contact
tracing
would
be
an
infringement
of
privacy
,
companies
like
Apple
and
Google
collaborated
on
a
Bluetooth-based
system
that
would
track
coronavirus
and
notify
people
who
have
been
exposed
without
surveilling
users.Beyond
smartphones
,
some
countries
and
workplaces
have
started
using
thermal
cameras
to
detect
potential
fevers
,
and
wearable
devices
and
sewage
surveillance
may
also
prove
helpful
.
In
some
places
,
the
QR
code
is
having
its
moment
.
And
some
city
and
state
officials
are
skeptical
about
digital
tracing
,
employing
thousands
of
people
to
do
the
tracing
instead
.
At
the
federal
level
,
there
has
been
talk
of
creating
a
national
pandemic
prediction
agency
to
study
Covid
and
get
ahead
of
future
pandemics.As
vaccination
becomes
more
widespread
,
there
's
also
the
question
of
if
and
how
to
keep
track
of
who
has
received
their
shots
.
Vaccine
passports
,
or
ways
to
verify
immunity
,
are
in
the
works
.
But
even
before
many
exist
,
they
've
already
been
the
source
of
controversy
.
Some
have
also
floated
plans
for
registries
and
apps.From
video
games
to
streaming
services
,
we
’
re
living
in
the
golden
age
of
digital
entertainment
!
You
can
cope
with
cabin
fever
by
working
out
,
meditating
,
or
getting
really
into
bread
baking
like
everyone
else
on
the
internet
.
Maybe
there
's
a
drive-in
movie
theater
near
you
,
or
you
have
access
to
a
roof
.
And
if
you
’
re
really
feeling
ambitious
,
you
can
always
do
your
taxes
.
Whatever
you
do
,
promise
you
'll
try
to
avoid
doomscrolling
?
Even
if
you
’
re
lucky
enough
to
be
working
from
home
,
staying
productive
out
of
the
office
is
an
adjustment
.
The
right
gear
and
a
good
internet
connection
make
a
world
of
difference
.
So
does
mastering
the
art
of
Zoom
.
Our
recommendation
:
Commit
to
the
home
office
and
invest
in
a
standing
desk
,
or
even
a
treadmill
desk
!
Staying
social
is
important
for
staving
off
isolation
while
we
’
re
all
sheltering
at
home
.
The
right
gear
can
help
,
and
a
well-placed
joke
and
sense
of
self-awareness
go
a
long
way
.
And
if
you
’
re
a
parent
,
it
’
s
worth
noticing
how
this
may
be
affecting
your
child
or
teenager
differently.It
goes
without
saying
that
this
pandemic
has
done
a
number
on
everyone
's
mental
health
.
Here
are
a
few
tips
for
staying
relaxed
and
calm
,
and
for
finding
a
therapist
who
works
for
you
during
this
crazy
time
.
Especially
as
the
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
seems
like
it
's
coming
into
focus
,
it
's
important
to
be
gentle
with
yourself
.
And
as
your
world
does
begin
to
reopen
bit
by
bit
,
small
tricks
and
routines
can
help
with
reentry.As
unemployment
rates
and
death
tolls
rose
last
spring
,
it
was
evident
that
this
pandemic
was
affecting
everyone
.
But
the
way
it
’
s
hit
some
of
America
’
s
most
vulnerable
populations—children
and
patients
without
an
internet
connection
at
home
,
people
without
a
home
to
shelter
in
,
members
of
the
Navajo
Nation
,
incarcerated
individuals—illuminates
many
of
the
chasms
that
divide
society
.
How
much
you
make
determines
how
well
you
're
able
to
prevent
getting
sick
.
It
's
been
particularly
distressing
to
see
the
disease
's
disproportionate
impact
on
communities
of
color
,
a
reality
much
of
the
Covid-19
data
we
do
have
does
n't
fully
reveal
.
Churches
and
courts
are
two
of
many
institutions
that
have
struggled
with
the
unequal
impact
of
this
pandemic
.
Hot
spots
have
also
emerged
in
poorer
,
densely
populated
cities
in
the
global
south
.
And
even
in
Silicon
Valley
,
Big
Tech
's
shadow
workforce
is
barely
scraping
by.From
airlines
to
influencers
,
every
industry
will
be
changed
by
this
pandemic
.
Those
that
have
adapted
quickly—whether
that
means
taking
your
business
online
or
placing
robots
on
the
assembly
line—indicate
that
embracing
technology
may
be
necessary
for
survival
.
For
essential
businesses
,
this
crisis
has
spurred
new
conversations
about
workers
’
basic
protections
and
benefits
,
like
sick
pay
.
As
some
businesses
reopen
,
workers
who
fear
returning
face
difficult
decisions
.
From
pro
sports
to
patio
dining
,
everyone
is
trying
to
come
up
with
ways
to
keep
patrons
and
participants
safe
.
And
creatives
are
coming
up
with
new
ways
to
make
and
put
out
their
work
.
Tech
companies
whose
employees
are
all
at
home
have
modified
their
workplace
perks
accordingly
.
And
when
those
of
us
working
remotely
do
return
to
the
office
,
it
likely
wo
n't
look
the
same
.
Some
may
never
go
back
to
the
office
at
all
,
or
they
may
go
back
only
some
of
the
time.When
and
how
to
reopen
schools
for
in-person
classes
remains
a
hot
topic
across
the
country
.
For
students
and
institutions
alike
,
the
switch
to
remote
learning
last
spring
was
a
challenge
.
No
one
knows
exactly
how
much
of
a
risk
it
is
to
resume
in
person
,
and
decisions
about
reopening
have
been
made
on
a
slapdash
,
case-by-case
basis
.
Many
schools
have
opted
for
a
hybrid
model
and
some
went
fully
remote
,
though
the
digital
divide
makes
this
tough
for
some
students
.
And
those
school
buildings
that
are
open
for
in-person
classes
have
mulled
or
adopted
new
technologies
like
facial
recognition
thermal
cameras
and
improved
ventilation
.
Parents
have
been
faced
with
a
slew
of
challenging
questions
,
from
how
to
set
up
a
good
learning
environment
at
home
to
whether
or
not
to
pod.As
for
higher
education
,
the
American
college
experience
has
n't
been
anything
like
usual
,
whether
students
are
learning
in-person
or
online
.
Many
institutions
bungled
their
reopenings
last
fall
.
But
there
are
some
changes
that
have
occurred
during
the
pandemic
that
could
actually
make
higher
education
more
accessible
in
the
long
run.You
’
ve
probably
seen
pictures
of
car-free
city
streets
and
unpolluted
skies
,
but
the
pandemic
’
s
effect
on
climate
change
hasn
’
t
been
uniformly
positive
,
and
the
good
changes
probably
wo
n't
last
.
Single-use
plastic
is
making
a
comeback
,
the
Trump
administration
rolled
back
emissions
regulations
,
and
the
renewable
energy
industry
is
taking
a
serious
hit
.
Coronavirus
deaths
tend
to
be
higher
in
areas
with
worse
air
pollution
.
Not
to
mention
,
dealing
with
natural
disasters
is
much
harder
when
we
're
also
faced
with
a
pandemic
,
as
we
've
seen
with
wildfire
and
hurricane
seasons.Urbanists
have
heralded
the
pandemic
as
a
potential
opportunity
to
boost
small
cities
and
remake
big
ones
for
the
better
,
prioritizing
the
experience
of
pedestrians
and
bikers
over
cars
and
figuring
out
ways
to
make
buildings
breathe
better
.
Other
researchers
have
noticed
that
the
ways
urban
crime
dropped
in
2020
provide
important
information
that
could
help
cities
increase
safety
,
and
do
so
more
equitably
,
even
after
the
pandemic
.
Still
,
there
's
no
doubt
that
the
pandemic
has
taken
a
toll
on
urban
life
.
One
example
:
Mass
transit
,
the
lifeblood
of
cities
like
New
York
,
is
in
serious
jeopardy.One
of
America
's
many
pandemic
blunders
is
the
extent
to
which
states
have
been
left
to
fend
for
themselves
.
Last
spring
,
that
created
confusion
as
each
governor
charted
a
different
path
toward
reopening
businesses
.
And
as
cases
worsened
in
the
winter
,
piecemeal
decisionmaking
spelled
disaster
for
some
states
amid
rising
Covid
cases
.
To
coordinate
decisionmaking
,
states
in
the
Midwest
,
Northeast
,
and
West
Coast
formed
unprecedented
regional
alliances
.
Some
experts
said
states
should
also
be
uniting
to
figure
out
testing
,
while
some
states
are
worked
on
developing
their
own
contact
tracing
apps.On
his
first
day
in
office
,
President
Biden
affirmed
that
the
single
priority
of
his
administration
is
to
tackle
the
pandemic
,
marking
what
many
hope
will
be
a
new
phase
in
national
pandemic
policy
.
Under
President
Trump
,
the
federal
government
failed
to
speak
with
a
unified
voice
,
denying
the
very
real
toll
of
this
pandemic
rather
than
take
decisive
action
to
mitigate
its
effects
.
Despite
expert
advice
to
the
contrary
,
the
president
expressed
his
eagerness
to
get
people
back
to
work
.
This
came
after
the
White
House
ignored
warnings
dating
back
years
about
the
threat
of
a
pandemic
,
and
fell
short
where
preparedness
is
concerned
,
and
the
president
himself
contracted
coronavirus
.
Agencies
like
the
FDA
and
CDC
also
woefully
mismanaged
the
situation
and
politicized
what
should
have
been
a
public
health
issue.Want

Biden
meets
target
of
100
million
vaccinations
58
days
into
his
termPresident
Biden
announced
that
today
,
58
days
into
his
presidency
,
his
administration
will
meet
its
goal
of
doling
out
100
million
coronavirus
vaccines
within
its
first
100
days
.
Yesterday
the
White
House
also
announced
that
it
plans
to
“
loan
”
a
combined
4
million
doses
of
the
AstraZeneca
vaccine
to
Mexico
and
Canada
.
The
vaccine
has
been
authorized
for
use
by
the
WHO
but
not
yet
by
regulators
in
the
States
,
and
the
US
has
stockpiled
tens
of
millions
of
doses
while
awaiting
emergency
use
authorization.Individual
states
have
also
made
good
progress
.
After
President
Biden
announced
last
week
that
he
aims
to
make
vaccines
available
to
all
adults
by
May
1
,
at
least
17
states
have
moved
even
more
quickly
.
In
Mississippi
and
Alaska
,
appointments
are
already
open
to
anyone
age
16
and
older
.
In
Ohio
,
all
adults
will
be
able
to
sign
up
for
shots
starting
March
29
,
and
a
number
of
other
states
have
outlined
plans
for
expanding
eligibility
in
April
.
However
,
there
is
concern
about
who
an
age-based
system
leaves
behind
.
Disability
rights
advocates
have
expressed
anger
at
the
way
vulnerable
populations
are
being
forgotten
.
And
in
some
places
,
vaccinating
incarcerated
people
continues
to
be
a
struggle.CDC
amends
school
guidelines
,
paving
the
way
for
more
classrooms
to
reopenOn
Friday
morning
the
CDC
updated
its
guidelines
for
schools
,
saying
that
with
universal
masking
,
students
should
stay
3
feet
apart
from
one
another
,
rather
than
6
.
This
change
is
expected
to
allow
many
more
schools
to
resume
in-person
classes
.
Earlier
this
week
,
the
Biden
administration
also
said
it
would
put
$
10
billion
toward
screening
students
and
teachers
so
that
more
schools
can
reopen.Outside
of
the
classroom
,
many
states
have
inched
closer
to
reopening
this
week
:
New
Jersey
is
increasing
indoor
capacity
for
gyms
and
restaurants
,
and
New
York
announced
that
Yankees
and
Mets
games
will
be
open
to
fans
this
season
.
Still
,
experts
warn
that
accelerating
reopening
now
would
be
a
mistake
.
While
the
national
daily
case
average
continues
to
fall
,
as
do
hospitalization
rates
nationwide
,
the
average
number
of
cases
has
gone
up
at
least
10
percent
in
15
states
.
And
worryingly
,
Michigan
in
particular
is
seeing
a
dramatic
increase
in
hospitalizations.Cases
surge
in
Europe
as
regulators
affirm
AstraZeneca
’
s
safetyThe
European
Medicines
Agency
asserted
that
the
AstraZeneca
vaccine
is
safe
after
more
than
a
dozen
countries
paused
their
rollout
of
the
shot
amid
concerns
that
it
could
cause
blood
clots
.
The
EMA
did
add
that
a
new
warning
label
will
be
appended
to
the
vaccine
so
professionals
are
on
guard
for
a
potential
rare
complication
that
could
lead
to
blood
clots
and
bleeding
in
the
brain
;
however
,
experts
remain
staunch
in
their
insistence
that
the
science
proves
the
vaccine
is
safe
.
Overall
,
they
say
,
the
shot
will
prevent
much
more
illness
and
death
than

nears
approval
in

,
a
panel
of
experts
will
review
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
Johnson

’
s
single-dose
Covid-19
vaccine
,
the
last
step
before
the
FDA
decides
whether
or
not
to
approve
the
shot
.
That
decision
is
expected
Saturday
.
Earlier
this
week
,
an
FDA
review
found
that
the
vaccine
was
66
percent
effective
at
protecting
people
from
moderate
to
severe
cases
of
Covid-19
,
and
even
more
effective
at
protecting
against
severe
disease
.
J
&
J
has
said
that
if
approved
,
it
will
deliver
around
20
million
doses
to
the
US
by
the
end
of
March.In
addition
,
two
other
vaccines
,
from
Novavax
and
AstraZeneca
,
expect
to
apply
for
emergency
use
authorization
in
the
US
in
April
.
And
Pfizer
and
Moderna
both
told
US
lawmakers
this
week
that
they
’
re
expecting
a
major
boost
in
vaccine
deliveries
over
the
next
five
weeks
,
saying
they
’
ve
overcome
manufacturing
challenges
.
As
of
Thursday
,
6.5
percent
of
the
US
had
been
fully
vaccinated
,
and
almost
14
percent
had
received
the
first
dose
.
All
of
the
vaccine
news
of
the
last
week
indicates
that
those
numbers
will
continue
to
increase.Experts
look
at
whether
vaccines
reduce
transmission
and
protect
against
variantsThis
week
,
two
new
studies—both
of
which
have
yet
to
be
peer
reviewed—made
headlines
for
announcing
that
vaccinations
reduce
viral
spread
.
Experts
not
affiliated
with
the
studies
say
they
have
flaws
and
can
’
t
realistically
tell
us
exactly
how
much
vaccines
reduce
transmission
,
but
the
good
news
is
that
they
show
the
vaccines
are
working
well
.
For
the
moment
,
public
health
authorities
say
,
stay
masked
and
vigilant

even
once
you
’
re
vaccinated.Meanwhile
,
both
Moderna
and
Pfizer
are
working
to
modify
their
vaccines
so
that
they
better
protect
against
variants
.
On
Wednesday
,
Moderna
announced
that
a
new
version
of
its
vaccine
designed
to
target
the
variant
first
found
in
South
Africa
is
ready
for
human
testing
.
And
Pfizer
has
said
it
’
s
exploring
adding
a
third
booster
dose
to
specifically
target
the
same
mutation.International

week
,
the
WHO-led
Covax

,
sent
its
first
shipments
to
Ghana

.
Leaders
in

met
this

is
it
like
to
live
without
smell
?
Many
have
become
more
aware
of
smell
disorders
in
the
past
year
,
as
thousands
who
’
ve
had
Covid-19
have
lost
their
sense
of
smell
,
sometimes
for
months
.
But
smell
disorders
are
actually
deceptively
common
.
Losing
all
or
some
of
your
sense
of
smell
can
be
disorienting
,
to
say
the
least
:
You
can
’
t
experience
scent
memories
or
taste
food
the
same
way
.
And
there
are
health
and
safety
issues
that
the
condition
presents
,
like
missing
gas
leaks
or
not
being
able
to
tell
when
food
is
spoiled.The
emergence
of
this
worrying
variant
comes
at
a
pivotal
moment
in
the
course
of
the
pandemic
:
Public
health
officials
are
just
now
trying
to
decide
who
should
be
prioritized
to
receive
the
first
Covid-19
vaccines
approved
for
distribution
in
the
US
.
Reports
that
so
many
mutations
have
arisen
all
at
once
in
the
new
coronavirus—and
that
these
mutations
could
have
epidemiological
consequences—add
an
important
,
but
so
far
unappreciated
,
wrinkle
to
these
deliberations
.
The
pathogen
likely
has
more
opportunity
to
develop
mutations
in
immunocompromised
individuals
than
in
other
carriers
.
As
a
result
,
to
guard
against
the
emergence
of
new
and
more
dangerous
variants
of
SARS-CoV-2
,
we
should
consider
moving
immunocompromised
people—who
are
themselves
at
higher
risk
of
dying
from
Covid-19—closer
to
the
front
of
the
vaccination
line.Scientists
are
still
puzzling
over
how
the
streak
of
new
mutations
arose
in
the
UK
variant
.
It
could
just
be
a
fluke
of
how
the
virus
has
been
tracked
,
where
they
somehow
missed
a
gradual
accumulation
of
changes
as
it
passed
from
person
to
person
through
the
population
.
But
the
abruptness
with
which
the
suite
of
new
mutations
cropped
up
has
left
researchers
worried
that
all
or
most
of
the
changes
developed
in
a
single
person
.
When
an
active
infection
lingers
in
someone
’
s
body
,
an
arms
race
may
develop
between
the
virus
and
the
immune
system
.
Over
time
,
mutations
that
allow
the
virus
to
evade
successive
waves
of
defenses
such
as
antibodies
could
stack
up
;
and
the
longer
an
infection
lasts
in
a
person
,
the
more
opportunities
the
virus
has
to
add
such
variants.Since
early
in
the
pandemic
,
doctors
have
suspected
that
people
who
are
immunocompromised
are
particularly
prone
to
just
that
kind
of
extended
illness
.
Most
people
with
Covid-19
are
thought
to
stop
shedding
infectious
virus
after
around
10
days
from
the
time
they
were
infected
,
but
numerous
outlier
cases
have
been
identified
.
These
tend
to
involve
people
with
weakened
immune
systems
.
A
71-year-old
woman
who
became
infected
with
the
virus
at
a
Washington
nursing
home
in
February
,
and
who
had
a
kind
of
cancer
that
limited
her
antibody
production
,
ended
up
harboring
the
coronavirus
for
at
least
105
days
and
being
infectious
for
at
least
70.Could
the
virus
mutate
rapidly
under
such
conditions
?
It
’
s
certainly
pretty
stable
over
the
course
of
a
normal
,
shorter
bout
of
Covid
.
A
study
posted
online
,
which
has
not
yet
been
formally
reviewed
and
published
in
a
journal
,
found
very
little
viral
mutation
occurring
in
a
general
sampling
of
more
than
1,000
people
with
the
disease
.
At
the
same
time
,
studies
that
have
closely
followed
immunocompromised
individuals
have
been
less
reassuring
.
Michigan
researchers
followed
a
60-year-old
man
with
cancer
who
was
on
medication
to
suppress
his
immune
system
’
s
B
cells
,
which
normally
produce
antibodies
.
Over
the
four
months
that
they
tracked
him
,
the
researchers
found
that
SARS-CoV-2
’
s
spike
protein
,
which
is
the
principal
target
of
Covid
vaccines
,
remained
unchanged
.
However
they
did
observe
other
mutations
that
popped
up
elsewhere
in
the
virus
,
unrelated
to
the
spike
protein.Meanwhile
,
scientists
who
studied
the
immunocompromised
woman
from
the
Washington
nursing
home
“
observed
marked
within-host
genomic
evolution
of
SARS-CoV-2
with
continuous
turnover
of
dominant
viral
variants.
”
In
other
words
,
the
virus
was
definitely
evolving
variants—including
those
with
changes
to
the
spike
protein
sequence—during
the
course
of
her
infection.Another
group
,
writing
in
The
New
England
Journal
of
Medicine
earlier
this
month
,
detailed
the
trajectory
of
the
virus
in
a
45-year-old
man
with
an
autoimmune
disorder
for
which
he
was
receiving
immunosuppressants
.
In
this
case
they
found
there
was
“
accelerated
”
evolution
of
the
virus
in
the
individual
,
and
many
of
the
mutations
were
in
the
spike
protein
.
Most
immunocompromised
people
clear
SARS-CoV-2
infections
without
major
complications
,
they
wrote
,
but
“
this
case
highlights
the
potential
for
persistent
infection
and
accelerated
viral
evolution
associated
with
an
immunocompromised
state.
”
The
same
phenomenon
has
been
observed
in
other
conditions
where
the
immune
system
is
hampered
.
HIV
attacks
immune
function
,
which
allows
it
to
evolve
at
an
astoundingly
high
rate
,
making
it
even
harder
for
the
body
to
keep
producing
antibodies
that
bind
and
neutralize
the
virus
.
By
the
same
mechanism
,
HIV
infections
allow
other
viruses
in
the
individual
to
last
longer
and
morph
.
Herpes
simplex
virus
can
evolve
unusual
drug-resistance
in
AIDS
patients
,
for
example.Still
,
we
need
a
better
understanding
of
exactly
which
immunocompromised
patients
are
most
vulnerable
to
long-lasting
SARS-CoV-2
infection
.
The
category
of
``
immunocompromised
''
captures
such
a
wide
range
of
different
conditions
,
and
they
may
not
all
confer
the
same
risk
of
persistent
Covid-19
.
Brian
Wasik
,
a
virologist
at
Cornell
University
,
points
out
that
the
term
may
include
people
born
with
rare
disorders
that
diminish
their
ability
to
fight
off
pathogens
,
as
well
as
those
who
are
taking
immunosuppressants
to
allow
for
a
transplant
or
quell
an
autoimmune
disease.Evidence
for
the
links
between
immunocompromised
individuals
and
persistent
SARS-CoV-2
infections
,
and
between
persistent
infections
and
viral
evolution
,
is
compelling
enough
to
be
considered
in
discussions
about
vaccine
priority
.
On
Sunday
,
a
panel
from
the
US
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
recommended
that
immunocompromised
people
be
placed
in
“
Phase
1c
”
—the
third
wave—of
vaccine
rollout
.
That
means
they
’
re
due
to
receive
the
injections
at
the
same
time
as
those
with
cancer
,
coronary
heart
disease
,
or
obesity
,
among
other
conditions
.
That
decision
was
meant
to
address
the
particular
risks
posed
by
Covid-19
to
people
with
immune
system
issues
,
but
it
left
out
the
possibility
that
vaccinating
these
individuals
could
help
prevent
the
development
of
new
SARS-CoV-2
variants
that
would
make
this
pandemic
even
worse
than
it
already
is
.
For
that
reason
,
even
though
there
are
only
a
handful
of
directly
relevant
case
reports
,
public
health
officials
should
consult
with
virologists
about
whether
it
might
be
wise
to
move
immunocompromised
people
into
the
earlier
Phase
1b
group.At
the
very
least
,
we
need
better
monitoring
of
potential
changes
to
SARS-CoV-2
.
The
US
government
should
do
more
to
help
organize
viral
sequencing
efforts
.
The
CDC
has
a
program
nicknamed
Spheres
that
has
tried
to
capture
sequence
data
during
the
pandemic
,
but
it
’
s
falling
short
:
Where
the
UK
has
sequenced
an
estimated
10
percent
of
its
Covid-19
cases
,
the
US
has
only
managed
0.3
percent
.
“
It
’
s
a
little
bit
patchy
,
”
says
Adam
Lauring
of
the
University
of
Michigan
Medical
School
,
who
adds
that
his
team
has
uploaded
around
2
percent
of
the
sequence
variant
data
in
the
US
.
“
There
are
vast
swaths
of
the
country
where
there
aren
’
t
people
who
are
spending
a
lot
of
time
and
effort
”
on
this
task
.
Better
monitoring
of
viral
evolution
might
also
help
to
clarify
the
question
of
exactly
where—in
which
sick
people—these
changes
are
most
likely
to
accumulate.As
we
monitor
for
SARS-CoV-2
mutations
,
we
have
to
acknowledge
that
understanding
their
epidemiological
and
clinical
significance
requires
further
work
.
Meanwhile
,
the
virus
is
still
rampant
,
which
provides
more
opportunities
for
it
to
mutate
even
as
it
spreads
from
person
to
person
.
But
the
long-lasting
infections
in
some
immunocompromised
individuals
,
and
the
associated
potential
for
viral
evolution
,
should
be
a
focus
of
attention.But
retreat
does
not
always
mean
defeat
.
And
the
emergence
of
several
worrisome
new
coronavirus
variants
with
new
tricks
for
spreading
faster
or
evading
immune
responses
presents
another
possibility
:
that
the
current
reprieve
will
only
be
temporary
.
Public
health
experts
are
urging
governments
to
prepare
for
a
possible
new
wave
of
infections
driven
by
variants
like
B.1.1.7
,
which
has
already
been
identified
in
more
than
1,200
US
cases
and
in
nearly
every
state
,
according
to
data
from
the
US
Centers
for
Disease
Prevention
and
Control.That
’
s
more
than
double
the
number
reported
two
weeks
earlier
.
But
the
real
number
is
likely
far
higher
.
How
much
higher
?
No
one
knows
.
That
’
s
because
the
only
way
to
tell
which
version
of
the
coronavirus
is
causing
an
infection
is
to
sequence
its
genome
.
In
this
country
,
that
should
be
easy
enough—the
US
is
a
sequencing
superpower
.
It
has
dozens
of
academic
institutions
and
massive
commercial
labs
with
the
capacity
to
crank
out
genomes
at
a
rapid
clip
.
But
the
federal
government
’
s
response
through
much
of
the
pandemic
didn
’
t
include
a
plan
to
mobilize
America
’
s
DNA-mappers
into
a
coordinated
coronavirus-monitoring
corps
.
SARS-CoV-2
surveillance
,
well
,
sucked.At
the
end
of
last
year
,
the
CDC
finally
got
the
green
light
to
roll
out
additional
programs
and
funding
aimed
at
changing
that
.
Since
then
,
the
US
has
boosted
its
sequencing
from
about
3,000
viral
genomes
per
week
to
more
than
7,000
.
But
scientists
say
it
’
s
still
not
close
to
enough
.
And
we
’
re
running
out
of
time
to
catch
up
.
Because
while
Congress
debates
a
bill
that
could
provide
the
necessary
infusion
of
funds
for
building
out
the
genomic
surveillance
system
the
US
should
have
had
all
along
,
variants—both
the
ones
scientists
know
to
be
worried
about
and
the
ones
they
haven
’
t
discovered
yet—are
expanding
their
territory.
“
Across
the
US
right
now
,
we
’
re
seeing
a
doubling
of
B.1.1.7
every
10
days
,
”
says
Karthik
Gangavarapu
,
a
computational
biologist
at
the
Scripps
Institute
in
La
Jolla
,
California
.
He
’
s
part
of
a
team
of
researchers
that
has
been
tracking
the
rapid
spread
of
the
extra-contagious
lineage
,
which
is
still
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
“
UK
variant
,
”
In
a
study
posted
online
earlier
this
month
,
the
team
analyzed
more
than
200
viral
genomes
of
the
B.1.1.7
lineage
collected
from
around
the
country
,
and
they
found
that
the
variant
most
likely
arrived
in
the
US
in
November
,
a
month
before
it
was
first
detected
here
.
Then
they
calculated
how
fast
the
variant
spread
during
the
months
of
December
and
January
:
between
35
and
45
percent
faster
than
existing
US
strains
.
Though
it
has
not
yet
been
published
in
a
peer-reviewed
journal
,
the
data
provides
the
first
hard
evidence
bolstering
a
forecast
issued
in
January
by
the
CDC
,
projecting
that
B.1.1.7
would
become
the
dominant
variant
in
the
US
by
late
March.
“
What
we
’
ve
seen
over
the
last
few
weeks
is
that
things
are
basically
trending
the
way
we
thought
they
would
,
”
says
William
Lee
,
the
vice
president
of
science
at
Helix
and
a
coauthor
on
the
study
.
Helix
,
a
San
Diego-based
DNA
testing
lab
in
partnership
with
Illumina
,
is
one
of
three
commercial
labs
contracted
by
the
CDC
to
conduct
genomic
surveillance
of
SARS-CoV-2
.
Technically
,
Illumina
does
the
sequencing
and
Helix
provides
the
viral
material
,
recovered
from
nasal
swabs
the
company
uses
to
test
for
coronavirus
.
And
because
of
a
quirk
in
the
test
’
s
design
,
Helix
can
easily
flag
the
samples
most
likely
to
contain
B.1.1.7.It
’
s
not
a
unique
quirk
,
but
like
many
other
Covid-19
tests
,
Helix
’
s
hunts
for
three
snippets
of
the
virus
’
s
genome
.
One
of
those
snippets
is
on
the
S
gene
,
which
codes
for
the
virus
’
s
infection-enabling
spike
protein
.
The
B.1.1.7
variant
happens
to
have
a
six-letter
deletion
on
that
section
of
the
S
gene
.
So
the
test
for
a
person
infected
with
it
still
comes
back
positive
,
but
missing
the
S
gene
signal
.
Scientists
have
dubbed
it
“
S
gene
dropout
”
or
“
S
gene
target
failure
,
”
SGTF
for
short
.
It
can
be
a
useful
shortcut
for
estimating
how
widely
B.1.1.7
is
circulating
in
an
area
,
but
because
other
innocuous
variants
also
have
the
same
deletion
,
the
only
way
to
know
for
sure
is
to
sequence.After
the
UK
sounded
the
alarm
over
B.1.1.7
in
late
December
,
Helix
began
sending
every
SGTF
sample
off
to
Illumina
for
sequencing
.
Back
then
,
they
’
d
find
about
100
instances
of
S
gene
dropout
every
day
.
And
most
of
them
didn
’
t
turn
out
to
be
B.1.1.7
.
But
now
,
says
Lee
,
in
places
like
Florida
and
Southern
California
,
all
the
S
gene
dropouts
are
B.1.1.7
.
It
’
s
no
longer
feasible
to
sequence
them
all
,
because
there
are
just
too
many—at
least
in
those
two
locations
,
which
represent
about
50
percent
of
the
tests
Helix
conducts
.
“
In
Florida
,
we
’
re
seeing
B.1.1.7
now
representing
about
15
percent
of
all
new
Covid-19
cases
,
”
says
Lee
.
“
Six
weeks
ago
,
it
was
less
than
1
percent.
”
The
Florida
Department
of
Health
did
not
respond
to
WIRED
’
s
questions
.
But
the
fate
of
that
state
over
the
next
few
weeks
may
be
a
bellwether
of
what
’
s
to
come
for
the
rest
of
the
US
.
According
to
the
CDC
,
B.1.1.7
prevalence
is
still
low—approaching
1
percent—across
the
country
.
But
Helix
’
s
data
suggests
other
hot
spots
are
beginning
to
emerge
,
including
in
Georgia
,
Texas
,
and
Pennsylvania
.
That
means
the
decisions
government
officials
in
those
areas
make
in
the
coming
days
and
weeks
regarding
reopening
schools
and
businesses
will
be
critical
.
Actions
to
slow
the
spread
of
more
contagious
variants
are
most
effective
during
the
earliest
phases
of
circulation.
“
Because
we
’
ve
detected
this
early
,
that
gives
us
precious
time
to
try
to
bring
down
current
levels
of
transmission
and
vaccinate
as
many
people
as
possible
,
”
says
Gangavarapu
.
Those
two
metrics
,
he
says
,
are
what
will
dictate
whether
or
not
the
US
sees
a
big
spike
due
to
the
new
lineages
.
“
It
’
s
a
race
against
time
,
”
he
continues
.
“
If
we
don
’
t
do
those
things
,
an
even
bigger
wave
than
what
we
saw
this
winter
is
possible
.
If
you
open
up
everything
right
now
,
that
’
s
almost
guaranteed
to
happen.
”
Gangavarapu
says
his
team
of
collaborators
has
found
plenty
of
B.1.1.7
in
circulation
.
But
so
far
,
their
sequencing
efforts
haven
’
t
captured
either
of
the
two
variants
that
are
suspected
to
be
the
best
immune
evasion
artists—the
B.1.351
and
P.1
variants
,
discovered
in
South
Africa
and
Brazil
,
respectively
.
According
to
CDC
data
,
only
a
handful
of
those
have
been
reported
in
the
US
so
far
,
mostly
in
people
who
recently
returned
from
traveling
.
But
imports
aren
’
t
the
only
thing
to
worry
about
.
There
are
homegrown
variants
too.Jeremy
Kamil
is
one
of
the
people
looking
for
them
.
A
virologist
at
Louisiana
State
University
Health
Sciences
Center
Shreveport
,
Kamil
normally
studies
the
cytomegalovirus
family
,
but
starting
last
spring
,
he
combined
forces
with
Vaughn
Cooper
,
the
director
of
the
Center
for
Evolutionary
Biology
and
Medicine
at
the
University
of
Pittsburgh
who
runs
a
microbial
sequencing
startup
,
to
set
up
genomic
surveillance
for
SARS-CoV-2
in
Louisiana
.
For
months
,
they
sequenced
hundreds
of
samples
from
coronavirus
tests
randomly
collected
from
around
the
state
,
watching
for
anything
unusual
.
On
January
27
,
Kamil
noticed
exactly
that—a
batch
of
samples
that
all
contained
a
mutation
he
hadn
’
t
seen
before
.
When
he
looked
closer
,
he
saw
that
each
of
the
mutant
viruses
were
closely
related—they
all
belonged
to
the
same
genetic
lineage
.
And
though
that
lineage
was
quite
young
,
dating
back
only
to
the
beginning
of
December
in
his
data
,
it
was
growing
more
common
every
day.Kamil
uploaded
the
genomes
to
an
online
database
called
GISAID
,
used
by
researchers
around
the
world
.
The
next
day
,
scientists
at
the
University
of
New
Mexico
contacted
him
.
They
had
found
the
same
variant
in
their
state
.
Meanwhile
,
Cooper
was
scouring
the
database
looking
for
more
viruses
with
the
same
mutation—a
genetic
alteration
which
changes
the
677th
amino
acid
in
the
coronavirus
’
s
spike
protein
.
He
found
more
,
and
not
just
in
Louisiana
and
New
Mexico
,
but
also
North
Carolina
,
Massachusetts
,
and
eight
other
states
.
The
researchers
realized
they
needed
a
phylogenist
to
get
their
viral
family
tree
in
order
,
so
they
enlisted
the
help
of
Emma
Hodcroft
at
the
University
of
Bern
in
Switzerland
.
Within
a
week
,
her
team
had
traced
the
emergence
of
seven
new
variants
in
the
US
,
each
of
which
had
evolved
the
same
mutation
independently.The
researchers
described
this
pattern
as
an
example
of
“
convergent
evolution
”
in
a
preprint
posted
Sunday
.
“
It
’
s
a
pretty
strong
indication
of
an
adaptation
,
even
if
we
don
’
t
yet
know
what
that
adaptation
is
,
”
says
Cooper
,
a
coauthor
of
the
study
,
which
has
not
yet
been
peer-reviewed.We
tend
to
use
the
singular
word
“
coronavirus
”
when
referring
to
the
bug
that
causes
Covid-19
.
But
a
more
accurate
way
to
think
about
SARS-CoV-2
is
as
a
population
of
viruses
.
And
that
population
is
in
a
state
of
constant
flux—expanding
and
contracting
,
mutating
,
and
evolving
new
lineages
as
it
spreads
from
person
to
person
.
Genetic
epidemiologists
can
track
those
minute
changes
,
following
them
like
the
branches
of
a
family
tree
to
identify
clusters
of
cases
all
linked
to
one
another
.
With
enough
viral
genomes
,
they
can
also
zoom
out
to
compare
how
fast
different
branches
are
growing
.
If
one
branch
starts
to
take
off
,
it
can
indicate
that
the
genetic
changes
those
viruses
have
acquired
provide
some
kind
of
competitive
advantage
.
And
if
a
bunch
of
different
branches
independently
acquire
the
same
mutation
,
and
they
all
start
to
take
off
,
well
,
that
’
s
convergent
evolution.Though
the
seven
variants
identified
by
Cooper
,
Kamil
,
Hodcroft
,
and
company
appear
to
have
become
more
common
in
recent
months—accounting
for
up
to
15
percent
of
the
transmission
in
some
places
where
they
have
been
found—there
’
s
still
much
the
researchers
don
’
t
understand
about
them
.
Where
did
they
first
emerge
?
Are
they
spreading
faster
because
the
677
mutation
changes
the
virus
’
s
behavior
,
as
is
the
case
with
the
other
major
variants
of
concern
first
detected
abroad
?
Or
did
holiday
travel
and
family
gatherings
in
the
US
spread
it
farther
and
faster
than
other
domestic
strains
?
Even
basic
questions
about
the
real
prevalence
of
each
new
variant
are
hard
to
answer
,
because
the
nation
is
still
so
far
behind
on
sequencing.
“
What
we
’
ve
discovered
is
just
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
,
”
says
Cooper
.
Currently
the
US
has
sequenced
the
genomes
of
just
0.4
percent
of
all
coronavirus
cases
,
according
to
a
WIRED
analysis
of
GISAID
data
.
By
comparison
,
the
UK
is
doing
about
10
percent
.
Denmark
,
the
world
leader
,
has
surpassed
the
50
percent
mark.The
good
news
is
that
all
the
sequencing
being
done
elsewhere
in
the
world
is
finding
that
the
virus
keeps
settling
on
the
same
genetic
changes
in
its
hunt
for
an
advantage
.
That
suggests
it
has
chanced
upon
a
run
of
good
cards
,
but
there
might
not
be
many
better
ones
left
in
the
deck
.
“
In
that
sense
,
”
says
Cooper
,
“
convergence
is
actually
our
friend
here
,
because
it
limits
the
roster
of
mutations
we
have
to
pay
attention
to.
”
That
’
s
not
just
good
for
surveillance
and
testing
,
but
also
for
vaccine
makers
trying
to
future-proof
their
shots
.
Any
constraints
on
the
number
and
placement
of
useful
mutations
should
make
it
easier
to
develop
an
arsenal
of
boosters
that
will
be
effective
against
whatever
variants
are
yet
to
emerge.But
that
doesn
’
t
change
the
fact
that
the
US
is
still
disastrously
unprepared
to
spot
them
when
they
do
.
As
WIRED
has
previously
reported
,
scaling
up
a
national
SARS-CoV-2
monitoring
network
involves
coordinating
a
patchwork
of
players—academics
like
Kamil
and
Gangavarapu
,
industry
players
like
Helix
,
and
labs
on
the
front
lines
,
operated
by
public
health
departments
and
hospitals
.
Connecting
sequencing
facilities
to
patient
samples
and
data
requires
coordination—both
in
terms
of
logistics
and
of
agreeing
to
do
things
in
a
standardized
way.All
of
that
takes
time
and
money
.
Each
viral
sequence
costs
between
$
25
and
$
400
to
generate
.
So
far
,
the
CDC
has
funded
seven
universities
to
the
tune
of
$
14.5
million
;
signed
contracts
with
Illumina
,
Helix
,
and
medical
testing
behemoths
LabCorp
and
Quest
Diagnostics
for
$
12.5
million
;
and
released
a
further
$
15
million
to
public
health
labs
.
But
this
week
,
the
Biden
administration
announced
it
is
providing
a
much
needed
infusion
of
cash—almost
$
200
million—intended
to
ramp
up
the
nation
’
s
sequencing
capacity
from
7,000
to
25,000
samples
per
week
.
That
would
put
the
US
on
track
to
capture
about
5
percent
of
new
coronavirus
cases
,
provided
they
continue
to
decline
.
It
’
s
a
threshold
scientists
at
Illumina
estimate
the
country
needs
to
hit
in
order
to
detect
a
new
variant
before
it
grows
to
more
than
1
percent
of
total
cases.A
spokesperson
for
the
CDC
declined
to
say
whether
the
agency
was
setting
specific
targets
.
“
There
is
currently
no
consensus
in
the
US
or
globally
on
the
optimal
rate
for
genomic
surveillance
,
”
she
wrote
in
an
email
to
WIRED
.
In
a
briefing
Wednesday
,
White
House
testing
czar
Carole
Johnson
described
the
funding
as
a
“
pilot
”
to
tide
the
CDC
over
until
Congress
passes
the
proposed
$
1.9
trillion
American
Rescue
Plan
.
The
House
version
of
that
bill
sets
aside
$
1.75
billion
for
genomic
surveillance.
“
It
’
s
really
great
that
we
have
interest
from
Congress
to
invest
in
this
,
”
says
Lane
Warmbrod
,
coauthor
of
a
new
report
from
the
Johns
Hopkins
Center
for
Health
Security
,
outlining
recommendations
for
what
an
effective
SARS-CoV-2
surveillance
program
should
look
like
.
In
the
short
term
,
she
says
,
labs
need
money
to
buy
reagents
and
sequencers
,
and
to
hire
and
train
personnel
to
run
them
.
That
includes
building
up
a
bioinformatics
workforce
in
public
health
labs—people
who
can
sort
,
clean
,
and
interpret
the
reams
of
genomic
data
produced
by
surveillance
sequencing.
“
The
much
bigger
barrier
is
the
informatics
side
,
”
says
Warmbrod
.
In
addition
to
people
,
that
also
means
computational
firepower
.
She
and
her
colleagues
suggest
that
CPU-strapped
public
health
departments
could
partner
with
the
Department
of
Energy
,
which
operates
supercomputers
around
the
country
,
to
process
increasing
loads
of
genomic
data
.
“
We
have
the
capacity
and
the
expertise
in
this
country
,
”
she
says
.
“
We
just
need
to
incentivize
it
and
put
resources
where
it
’
ll
be
most
efficient.
”
She
and
her
colleagues
recommend
that
funds
should
go
toward
coordinating
the
characterization
of
variants—which
ones
should
be
studied
and
what
experiments
scientists
should
perform
.
Right
now
,
the
old
standards
of
science
are
still
largely
being
applied
.
Whoever
discovers
a
variant
gets
to
hold
onto
it
and
study
it
.
But
when
those
discoveries
could
have
such
a
huge
effect
on
human
health
,
Warmbrod
argues
,
the
government
might
want
to
step
in
to
make
sure
studies
are
being
done
swiftly
,
safely
,
and
in
the
public
eye
.
In
the
longer
term
,
she
also
believes
the
US
should
invest
some
of
those
congressional
funds
in
a
national
pandemic
prediction
agency
to
safeguard
against
emerging
threats
even
after
the
Covid
crisis
subsides.But
for
now
,
building
up
sequencing
capacity
in
whatever
way
gets
it
done
the
fastest
should
be
the
highest
priority
,
says
Warmbrod
.
“
We
know
variants
are
here
.
We
know
they
’
re
going
to
keep
coming
as
long
as
there
’
s
transmission
.
These
variants
could
pop
up
anywhere
,
”
she
says
.
“
And
right
now
,
in
most
places
in
the
country
,
a
new
variant
could

how
will

pandemic
hits
grim
milestones
in
the
USThis
week
,
coronavirus
numbers
in
the
US
continued
to
get
bleaker
.
On
Thursday
,
as
cases
and
hospitalization
rates
rose
further
,
the
country
hit
a
grim
milestone
:
The
total
number
of
Americans
who
have
died
from
Covid-19
surpassed
the
number
of
US
service
people
who
died
in
combat
during
World
War
II
.
The
day
before
,
the
US
set
a
new
record
for
the
most
Covid-19
deaths
in
a
day
at
3,054
,
a
total
that
exceeds
the
death
tolls
of
9/11
or
Pearl
Harbor
.
CDC
director
Robert
Redfield
warned
that
deaths
are
likely
to
exceed
those
numbers
for
the
next
60
to
90
days.In
response
,
many
states
are
implementing
new
restrictions
.
Virginia
imposed
a
new
curfew
and
expanded
its
mask
mandate
,
while
Maryland
and
New
York
City
did
away
with
indoor
dining
.
New
Mexico
has
temporarily
suspended
all
nonessential
surgeries
to
alleviate
the
strain
on
the
state
’
s
hospitals
.
A
plan
has
also
been
put
in
place
that
would
allow
doctors
to
ration
supplies
and
determine
who
to
care
for
based
on
their
likelihood
of
survival
,
should
that
be
necessary
.
Part
of
the
challenge
is
that
policymakers
and
public
health
experts
know
the
sum
of
all
these
different
interventions
reduces
spread
,
but
it
’
s
unclear
which
are
the
most
effective
on
their
own
.
Without

information
,
it
’
s
essential
that
everyone
follows
all
the
guidelines
we

we

does
it
mean
to
test
positive
for
Covid-19
?
When
you
receive
a
Covid-19
test
,
it
comes
back
either
positive
or
negative
.
But
some
experts
say
we
’
d
benefit
from
developing
a
more
nuanced
approach
that
takes
into
account
the
sensitivity
of
different
kinds
of
tests
and
how
much
virus
they
detect
.
Even
the
way
labs
analyze
tests
can
have
an
impact
on
your
results
:
Not
all
of
them
use
the
same
thresholds
for
figuring
out
if
a
sample
is
positive
for
the
presence
of
the
virus
.
And
a
patient
’
s
viral
load
rises
and
falls
over
the
course
of
a
few
days
,
which
means
some
people
who
receive
positive
tests
may
actually
be
nearing
the
end
of
their
illness
,
and
some
who
receive
negative
results
may
in
fact
have
the
virus
but
not
be
sick
yet
.
It
’
s
one
of
many
reasons
why
testing
is
not
,
on
its
own
,
an
effective
way
of
curbing
Covid-19
.

What
you
need
to
know
According
to
the
World
Health
Organization
(
WHO
)
,
“
Coronaviruses
(
CoV
)
are
a
large
family
of
viruses
that
cause
illness
ranging
from
the
common
cold
to
more
severe
diseases
such
as
Middle
East
Respiratory
Syndrome
(
MERS-CoV
)
and
Severe
Acute
Respiratory
Syndrome
(
SARS-CoV
)
.
A
novel
coronavirus
(
nCoV
)
is
a
new
strain
that
has
not
been
previously
identified
in
humans.
”
This
means
that
,
in
general
,
the
human
population
has
no
acquired
immunity
to
the
new
coronavirus
and
while
most
people
who
contract
the
virus
will
experience
no
or
mild
symptoms
,
some
people
will
develop
severe
or
even
life-threatening
symptoms.The
coronavirus
--
labeled
as
COVID-19
by
WHO
--
was
first
identified
in
the
city
of
Wuhan
in
the
Hubei
province
of
China
in
December
.
Since
it
first
emerged
in
China
,
COVID-19
has
spread
around
the
world
and
has
now
been
identified
in
at
least
157
countries
.
Researchers
suspect
the
virus
originated
in
an
animal
population
-
likely
bats
-
and
was
transferred
to
humans
via
a
secondary
source
.
Symptoms
include
respiratory
issues
,
fever
,
cough
,
shortness
of
breath
and
breathing
difficulties
.
In
more
severe
cases
,
infection
can
cause
pneumonia
,
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
,
kidney
failure
,
and
can
even
be
fatal
.
How
can
you
prevent
the
spread
of
coronavirus
and
avoid
infection
?
WHO
recommends
washing
your
hands
regularly
;
covering
your
mouth
and
nose
when
coughing
and
sneezing
;
and
cooking
meat
and
eggs
thoroughly
.
Most
officials
are
recommending
that
people
with
symptoms
stay
home
and
self-isolate
to
avoid
spreading
the
virus
to
others
.
In
many
countries
,
governments
and
medical
communities
have
advised
all
people
-
with
or
without
symptoms
-
to
stay
home
and
avoid
large
gatherings
to
prevent
the
spread
of
the
disease
,
and
some
countries
are
temporarily
shutting
down
schools
and
universities
,
as
well
as
other
facilities
and
restricting
travel
.
These
measures
are
part
of
a
widespread
effort
to
slow
and
reduce
the
spread
of
the
virus
so
that
healthcare
systems
can
provide
thorough
treatment
and
allow
researchers
,
medical
professionals
,
and
government
officials
time
to
develop
treatments
and
implement
public
health
protocols
.
To
best
“
flatten
the
curve
”
--
a
graphical
representation
of
reducing
the
exponential
spread
of
the
virus
--
officials
are
urging
people
to
stay
at
home.While
no
vaccine
exists
yet
for
COVID-19
,
the
National
Institute
of
Health
(
NIH
)
in
the
United
States
reports
that
scientists
are
working
on
“

)

”
Other
countries
have
also
stepped
up
their
research
and
are
working
hard
to
develop
a
vaccine
as
soon
as
possible
.
Researchers
have
already
started
some
human
trials
,
though
it
likely
will
be
many
months
before
a
vaccine
is
available
worldwide.The
good
news
is
that
healthy
young
people
--
college
or
university
students
like
you
--
are
at
low
risk
of
contracting
the
virus
,
and
if
you
do
,
the
symptoms
are
milder
.
However
,
you
can
be
a
carrier
of
the
virus
without
even
knowing
it
so
students
are
still
encouraged
to
take
the
necessary
precautions
to
protect
themselves
and
prevent
the
spread
of
the
virus
to
those
more
vulnerable

Best
practices
and
social
distancingAs
a
college
or
university
student
,
especially
international
students
studying
abroad
,
there
’
s
a
lot
of
information
to
consider
,
and
you
’
ll
want
to
make
sure
you
stay
informed
and
up-to-date
.
Many
of
the
top
universities
and
colleges
around
the
world
are
encouraging
students
to
stay
home
,
many
have
canceled
in-person
classes
and
are
shifting
courses
online
and
into
the
virtual
classroom.In
the
US
top
academic
institutions
are
closing
campuses
across
the
country
.
Harvard
University
is
among
the
many
who
are
making
tough
decisions
to
close
campuses
and
cancel
in-person
classes
.
``
The
decision
to
move
to
virtual
instruction
was
not
made
lightly
,
''
Harvard
's
President
Lawrence
Bacow
said
in
a
statement
reports
InsideHigherEd.com
.
``
The
goal
of
these
changes
is
to
minimize
the
need
to
gather
in
large
groups
and
spend
prolonged
time
in
close
proximity
with
each
other
in
spaces
such
as

Best
practices
and
social
distancing
are
the
best
things
you
can
do
right
now.Meanwhile
,
over
1,000
students
at
the
University
of
Cambridge
have
written
to
Graham
Virgo
,
the
pro-vice
chancellor
for
education
,
calling
on
the
university
to
radically
change
the
way
its
summer
exams
are
conducted
,
amid
widespread
concern
the
virus
will
affect
exam
performance
.
They
suggest
alternative
modes
of
assessment
,
such
as
vivas
conducted
via
video
or
coursework
or
postponing
exams
and
dissertation
deadlines
,
until
restrictions
such
as
social
distancing
and
quarantining
have
been
eased
.
Some
of
the
institution
's
degrees
are
typically
graded
entirely
on
final-year
exams.What
is
“
social
distancing
”
?
This
now-viral
term
is
one
that
“
epidemiologists
are
using
to
refer
to
a
conscious
effort
to
reduce
close
contact
between
people
and
hopefully
stymie
community
transmission
of
the
virus
,
”
reports
Kaitlyn
Tiffany
for
The
Atlantic
.
An
appropriate
social
distance
is
staying
three
to
six
feet
apart
,
and
in
lieu
of
handshaking
or
hugging
,
an
elbow
bump
or
fist
bump
,
or
no
physical
contact
at
all
,
is
suggested
.
In
short
,
it
means
whenever
possible
,
avoiding
contact
with
other
people
.
Limiting
your
interactions
in
public
means
not
going
out
to
dinner
,
finding
an
alternative
way
to
workout
instead
of
going
to
the
gym
,
and
chatting
on
the
phone
with
your
friends
using
services
such
as
FaceTime
,
Skype
,
and
WhatsApp
.
Many
people
are
finding
creative
ways
to
stay
social
via
the
virtual
realm
while
limiting
their
person-to-person
contact
.
TikTok
in
particular
has
been
central
to
this
,
with
people
on
the
social
network
sharing
information
and
fun
‘
challenges
’
to
keep
spirits
up
(
such
as
keepy-uppies
with
a
toilet
roll
instead
of
a
football
)
and
interact
with
friends
and
others
.
Even
celebrities
are
joining
the
fun
-
musicians
such
as
John
Legend
,
Coldplay
's
Chris
Martin
,
and
Pink
are
holding
solitary
,
impromptu
concerts
on
social

,
while
others
are
reading
children
’

books
online
to
help
quarantined
families
with
bedtime
and
teachers
whose
schools
have
closed
are
offering
their
help
to
parents
and
children
virtually.Also
,
house-bound
people
in
Spain
and
Italy
have
mobilized
themselves
on
social

and
demonstrated
their
support
for
the
health
workers
fighting
the
coronavirus
by
collectively
applauding
them
from
their
windows
and
balconies
,
while
others
have
sang

together
from

It
may
be
comforting
to
consider
how
past
great
thinkers
,
artists
,
writers
,
and
makers
continued
to
work
through
historic
quarantines
like
the
plague
all
while
staying
both
creative

productive
.
Memes
of
how
Shakespeare
survived
the
pestilence
are
popping

everywhere
,
providing
levity
and
perspective
.
Great
works
were
even
inspired
by
the
turbulent
times
these
creators
lived
through
.
For
example
,
in
1665
,
Sir
Isaac
Newton
made
“
social
distancing
”
work
for
him
and
ended
up
producing
theories
that
would
turn
out
to
greatly
impact
humanity
and
our
understanding
of
the
way
the
world
works
.
During
an
outbreak
of
the
plague
in
London
Newton
“
returned
to
his
family
’
s
home
in
Cambridge
,
where
he
had
long
stretches
of
time
to
work
alone
on
various
questions
that
had
been
on
his
mind
.
While
there
,
he
had
a
breakthrough
regarding
the
nature
of
motion
and
gravity
,

Your

,
many
countries
have
taken
extreme
measures
to
contain
and
slow
the
spread
of
the
virus
,
including
limiting
travel
and
closing

.
In
most
cases
,
citizens

residents
of
those
countries
have
been
urged
to
return
home
as
soon
as
possible
and
many
countries
are
working

What
you
need
to
know
According
to
the
World
Health
Organization
(
WHO
)
,
“
Coronaviruses
(
CoV
)
are
a
large
family
of
viruses
that
cause
illness
ranging
from
the
common
cold
to
more
severe
diseases
such
as
Middle
East
Respiratory
Syndrome
(
MERS-CoV
)
and
Severe
Acute
Respiratory
Syndrome
(
SARS-CoV
)
.
A
novel
coronavirus
(
nCoV
)
is
a
new
strain
that
has
not
been
previously
identified
in
humans.
”
This
means
that
,
in
general
,
the
human
population
has
no
acquired
immunity
to
the
new
coronavirus
and
while
most
people
who
contract
the
virus
will
experience
no
or
mild
symptoms
,
some
people
will
develop
severe
or
even
life-threatening
symptoms.The
coronavirus
--
labeled
as
COVID-19
by
WHO
--
was
first
identified
in
the
city
of
Wuhan
in
the
Hubei
province
of
China
in
December
.
Since
it
first
emerged
in
China
,
COVID-19
has
spread
around
the
world
and
has
now
been
identified
in
at
least
157
countries
.
Researchers
suspect
the
virus
originated
in
an
animal
population
-
likely
bats
-
and
was
transferred
to
humans
via
a
secondary
source
.
Symptoms
include
respiratory
issues
,
fever
,
cough
,
shortness
of
breath
and
breathing
difficulties
.
In
more
severe
cases
,
infection
can
cause
pneumonia
,
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
,
kidney
failure
,
and
can
even
be
fatal
.
How
can
you
prevent
the
spread
of
coronavirus
and
avoid
infection
?
WHO
recommends
washing
your
hands
regularly
;
covering
your
mouth
and
nose
when
coughing
and
sneezing
;
and
cooking
meat
and
eggs
thoroughly
.
Most
officials
are
recommending
that
people
with
symptoms
stay
home
and
self-isolate
to
avoid
spreading
the
virus
to
others
.
In
many
countries
,
governments
and
medical
communities
have
advised
all
people
-
with
or
without
symptoms
-
to
stay
home
and
avoid
large
gatherings
to
prevent
the
spread
of
the
disease
,
and
some
countries
are
temporarily
shutting
down
schools
and
universities
,
as
well
as
other
facilities
and
restricting
travel
.
These
measures
are
part
of
a
widespread
effort
to
slow
and
reduce
the
spread
of
the
virus
so
that
healthcare
systems
can
provide
thorough
treatment
and
allow
researchers
,
medical
professionals
,
and
government
officials
time
to
develop
treatments
and
implement
public
health
protocols
.
To
best
“
flatten
the
curve
”
--
a
graphical
representation
of
reducing
the
exponential
spread
of
the
virus
--
officials
are
urging
people
to
stay
at
home.While
no
vaccine
exists
yet
for
COVID-19
,
the
National
Institute
of
Health
(
NIH
)
in
the
United
States
reports
that
scientists
are
working
on
“
a
Phase

clinical
trial
evaluating
an
investigational
vaccine
designed
to
protect
against
coronavirus
disease
2019
(
COVID-19
)
at
Kaiser
Permanente
Washington
Health
Research
Institute
(
KPWHRI
)
in
Seattle.
”
Other
countries
have
also
stepped
up
their
research
and
are
working
hard
to
develop
a
vaccine
as
soon
as
possible
.
Researchers
have
already
started
some
human
trials
,
though
it
likely
will
be
many
months
before
a
vaccine
is
available
worldwide.The
good
news
is
that
healthy
young
people
--
college
or
university
students
like
you
--
are
at
low
risk
of
contracting
the
virus
,
and
if
you
do
,
the
symptoms
are
milder
.
However
,
you
can
be
a
carrier
of
the
virus
without
even
knowing
it
so
students
are
still
encouraged
to
take
the
necessary
precautions
to
protect
themselves
and
prevent
the
spread
of
the
virus
to
those
more
vulnerable

Best
practices
and

distancingAs
a
college

student
,
especially
international
students
studying
abroad
,
there
’

a
lot
of
information
to
consider
,
and
you
’

want
to
make
sure
you
stay
informed
and
up-to-date
.
Many
of
the
top
universities
and
colleges
around
the
world
are
encouraging
students
to
stay
home
,
many
have
canceled
in-person
classes
and
are
shifting
courses
online
and
into
the
virtual
classroom.In
the
US
top
academic
institutions
are
closing
campuses
across
the
country
.
Harvard
University
is
among
the
many
who
are
making
tough
decisions
to
close
campuses
and
cancel
in-person
classes
.
``
The
decision
to
move
to
virtual
instruction
was
not
made
lightly
,
''
Harvard
's
President
Lawrence
Bacow
said
in
a
statement
reports
InsideHigherEd.com
.
``
The
goal
of
these
changes
is
to
minimize
the
need
to
gather
in
large
groups
and
spend
prolonged
time
in
close
proximity
with
each
other
in
spaces
such
as
classrooms
,
dining
halls
,
and
residential
buildings
.
''
Best
practices
and
social
distancing
are
the
best
things
you
can
do
right
now.Meanwhile
,
over
1,000
students
at
the
University
of
Cambridge
have
written
to
Graham
Virgo
,
the
pro-vice
chancellor
for
education
,
calling
on
the
university
to
radically
change
the
way
its
summer
exams
are
conducted
,
amid
widespread
concern
the
virus
will
affect
exam
performance
.
They
suggest
alternative
modes
of
assessment
,
such
as
vivas
conducted
via
video
or
coursework
or
postponing
exams
and
dissertation
deadlines
,
until
restrictions
such
as
social
distancing
and
quarantining
have
been
eased
.
Some
of
the
institution
's
degrees
are
typically
graded
entirely
on
final-year
exams.What
is
“
social
distancing
”
?
This
now-viral
term
is
one
that
“
epidemiologists
are
using
to
refer
to
a
conscious
effort
to
reduce
close
contact
between
people
and
hopefully
stymie
community
transmission
of
the
virus
,
”
reports
Kaitlyn
Tiffany
for
The
Atlantic
.
An
appropriate
social
distance
is
staying
three
to
six
feet
apart
,
and
in
lieu
of
handshaking
or
hugging
,
an
elbow
bump
or
fist
bump
,
or
no
physical
contact
at
all
,
is
suggested
.
In
short
,
it
means
whenever
possible
,
avoiding
contact
with
other
people
.
Limiting
your
interactions
in
public
means
not
going
out
to
dinner
,
finding
an
alternative
way
to
workout
instead
of
going
to
the
gym
,
and
chatting
on
the
phone
with
your
friends
using
services
such
as
FaceTime
,
Skype
,
and
WhatsApp
.
Many
people
are
finding
creative
ways
to
stay
social
via
the
virtual
realm
while
limiting
their
person-to-person
contact
.
TikTok
in
particular
has
been
central
to
this
,
with
people
on
the
social
network
sharing
information

It
may
be
comforting
to
consider
how
past
great
thinkers
,
artists
,
writers
,
and
makers
continued
to
work
through
historic
quarantines
like
the
plague
all
while
staying
both
creative
and
productive
.
Memes
of
how
Shakespeare
survived
the
pestilence
are
popping
up
everywhere
,
providing
levity
and
perspective
.
Great
works
were
even
inspired
by
the
turbulent
times
these
creators
lived
through
.
For
example
,
in
1665
,
Sir
Isaac
Newton
made
“
social
distancing
”
work
for
him
and
ended
up
producing
theories
that
would
turn
out
to
greatly
impact
humanity
and
our
understanding
of
the
way
the
world
works
.
During
an
outbreak
of
the
plague
in
London
Newton
“
returned
to
his
family
’
s
home
in
Cambridge
,
where
he
had
long
stretches
of
time
to
work
alone
on
various
questions
that
had
been
on
his
mind
.
While
there
,
he
had
a
breakthrough
regarding
the
nature
of
motion
and
gravity
,
”
finds
Tobias
Carroll
for
InsideHook.com
.
Time
will
tell
how
this
particular
moment
impacts
our
best
minds
and
makers.However
,
today
,
the
most
important
best
practices
remain
1
)
common
sense
,
and
2
)
washing
your
hands
.
Hand
washing
technique
memes
have
popped
up
all
over
the
internet
with
humorous
sayings
written
underneath
the
traditional
graphics
for
handwashing
with
soap
and
water
.
Keeping
a
sense
of
humour
about
it
all
in
these
tough
times
might
just
save
your
sanity
,
and
keep
morale
up
among
your
peers

For
example
,
did
you
catch
“
TikTok

that
went

?
If

,
take
a

to
enjoy
this
creative
genius
,
and
don

forget
that
aside
from
regular
hand

,
using

Creative
solutions
to
continue
your
studiesIn
response
to
the
outbreak
of
COVID-19
some
colleges
and
universities
are
canceling
or
suspending
exchange
programs
and
study
abroad
programs
.
And
in
affected
areas
,
some
colleges
and
universities
are
delaying
the
start
of
classes
after
Spring
Break
,
closing
campuses
,
or
changing
the
mode
of
instruction
.
If
you
are
part
of
an
exchange
or
study

program
,
monitor
your
email
and
texts
,
and
make
sure
you
are
signed
up
to
receive
the
alerts
from
your
college

.
While
some
classes
and
programs
may
be
canceled
entirely
,
technology
is
helping
students
around
the
world
continue
their
studies
during
the
outbreak
.
As
well
as
allowing
classes
to
proceed
while
university
campuses
are
shut
,
online
learning
options
help
to
limit
students
’
exposure
in
affected
areas
.
Your
college
or
university
might
temporarily
shift
your
classes
to
an
online
platform
,
which
will
require
your
professors
and
you
to
log
in
remotely
and
conduct
classes
virtually
.
At
the
start
of
the
outbreak
in
Asia
,

—
had
just
a

,
”
reports
Anya

,
who
also
finds
that
“
colleges

universities
around
the
United

are
now
asking

,
and
to
familiarize
themselves
with
video

programs
like
Zoom
,
in
the
event
that
an

keeps
students
confined
at

others
like
it
,
are
essential
tools
to

Another
helpful
trend
is
media
companies
,
like
Comcast

Charter
Communications
in
the
US
,
who
are
providing
free
internet
service
for
low-income

Zoom
CEO
Eric

“
Students

In
most
cases
,
citizens

of
those
countries
have
been
urged
to
return
home
as
soon
as
possible
and
many
countries
are
working
to
evacuate
their
citizens

Finally

About
a
year
ago
,
more
than
200
data
entries
from
the
genetic
sequencing
of
early
cases
of
Covid-19
in
Wuhan
disappeared
from
an
online
scientific
database.Now
,
by
rooting
through
files
stored
on
Google
Cloud
,
a
researcher
in
Seattle
reports
that
he
has
recovered
13
of
those
original
sequences
—
intriguing
new
information
for
discerning
when
and
how
the
virus
may
have
spilled
over
from
a
bat
or
another
animal
into
humans.The
new
analysis
,
released
on
Tuesday
,
bolsters
earlier
suggestions
that
a
variety
of
coronaviruses
may
have
been
circulating
in
Wuhan
before
the
initial
outbreaks
linked
to
animal
and
seafood
markets
in
December
2019.As
the
Biden
administration
investigates
the
contested
origins
of
the
virus
,
known
as
SARS-CoV-2
,
the
study
neither
strengthens
nor
discounts
the
hypothesis
that
the
pathogen
leaked
out
of
a
famous
Wuhan
lab
.
But
it
does
raise
questions
about
why
original
sequences
were
deleted
,
and
suggests
that
there
may
be
more
revelations
to
recover
from
the
far
corners
of
the
internet.
“
This
is
a
great
piece
of
sleuth
work
for
sure
,
and
it
significantly
advances
efforts
to
understand
the
origin
of
SARS-CoV-2
,
”
said
Michael
Worobey
,
an
evolutionary
biologist
at
the
University
of
Arizona
who
was
not
involved
in
the
study.Jesse
Bloom
,
a
virologist
at
the
Fred
Hutchinson
Cancer
Research
Center
who
wrote
the
new
report
,
called
the
deletion
of
these
sequences
suspicious
.
It
“
seems
likely
that
the
sequences
were
deleted
to
obscure
their
existence
,
”
he
wrote
in
the
paper
,
which
has
not
yet
been
peer-reviewed
or
published
in
a
scientific
journal.Dr
.
Bloom
and
Dr.
Worobey
belong
to
an
outspoken
group
of
scientists
who
have
called
for
more
research
into
how
the
pandemic
began
.
In
a
letter
published
in
May
,
they
complained
that
there
wasn
’
t
enough
information
to
determine
whether
it
was
more
likely
that
a
lab
leak
spread
the
coronavirus
,
or
that
it
leapt
to
humans
from
contact
with
an
infected
animal
outside
of
a
lab.The
genetic
sequences
of
viral
samples
hold
crucial
clues
about
how
SARS-CoV-2
shifted
to
our
species
from
another
animal
,
most
likely
a
bat
.
Most
precious
of
all
are
sequences
from
early
in
the
pandemic
,
because
they
take
scientists
closer
to
the
original
spillover
event.As
Dr.
Bloom
was
reviewing
what
genetic
data
had
been
published
by
various
research
groups
,
he
came
across
a
March
2020
study
with
a
spreadsheet
that
included
information
on
241
genetic
sequences
collected
by
scientists
at
Wuhan
University
.
The
spreadsheet
indicated
that
the
scientists
had
uploaded
the
sequences
to
an
online
database
called
the
Sequence
Read
Archive
,
managed
by
the
U.S.
government
’
s
National
Library
of
Medicine.But
when
Dr.
Bloom
looked
for
the
Wuhan
sequences
in
the
database
earlier
this
month
,
his
only
result
was
“
no
item
found.
”
Puzzled
,
he
went
back
to
the
spreadsheet
for
any
further
clues
.
It
indicated
that
the
241
sequences
had
been
collected
by
a
scientist
named
Aisi
Fu
at
Renmin
Hospital
in
Wuhan
.
Searching
medical
literature
,
Dr.
Bloom
eventually
found
another
study
posted
online
in
March
2020
by
Dr.
Fu
and
colleagues
,
describing
a
new
experimental
test
for
SARS-CoV-2
.
The
Chinese
scientists
published
it
in
a
scientific
journal
three
months
later.In
that
study
,
the
scientists
wrote
that
they
had
looked
at
45
samples
from
nasal
swabs
taken
“
from
outpatients
with
suspected
Covid-19
early
in
the
epidemic.
”
They
then
searched
for
a
portion
of
SARS-CoV-2
’
s
genetic
material
in
the
swabs
.
The
researchers
did
not
publish
the
actual
sequences
of
the
genes
they
fished
out
of
the
samples
.
Instead
,
they
only
published
some
mutations
in
the
viruses.But
a
number
of
clues
indicated
to
Dr.
Bloom
that
the
samples
were
the
source
of
the
241
missing
sequences
.
The
papers
included
no
explanation
as
to
why
the
sequences
had
been
uploaded
to
the
Sequence
Read
Archive
,
only
to
disappear
later.Perusing
the
archive
,
Dr.
Bloom
figured
out
that
many
of
the
sequences
were
stored
as
files
on
Google
Cloud
.
Each
sequence
was
contained
in
a
file
in
the
cloud
,
and
the
names
of
the
files
all
shared
the
same
basic
format
,
he
reported.Dr
.
Bloom
swapped
in
the
code
for
a
missing
sequence
from
Wuhan
.
Suddenly
,
he
had
the
sequence
.
All
told
,
he
managed
to
recover
13
sequences
from
the
cloud
this
way.With
this
new
data
,
Dr.
Bloom
looked
back
once
more
at
the
early
stages
of
the
pandemic
.
He
combined
the
13
sequences
with
other
published
sequences
of
early
coronaviruses
,
hoping
to
make
progress
on
building
the
family
tree
of
SARS-CoV-2.Working
out
all
the
steps
by
which
SARS-CoV-2
evolved
from
a
bat
virus
has
been
a
challenge
because
scientists
still
have
a
limited
number
of
samples
to
study
.
Some
of
the
earliest
samples
come
from
the
Huanan
Seafood
Wholesale
Market
in
Wuhan
,
where
an
outbreak
occurred
in
December
2019.But
those
market
viruses
actually
have
three
extra
mutations
that
are
missing
from
SARS-CoV-2
samples
collected
weeks
later
.
In
other
words
,
those
later
viruses
look
more
like
coronaviruses
found
in
bats
,
supporting
the
idea
that
there
was
some
early
lineage
of
the
virus
that
did
not
pass
through
the
seafood
market.Dr
.
Bloom
found
that
the
deleted
sequences
he
recovered
from
the
cloud
also
lack
those
extra
mutations
.
“
They
’
re
three
steps
more
similar
to
the
bat
coronaviruses
than
the
viruses
from
the
Huanan
fish
market
,
”
Dr.
Bloom
said.This
suggests
,
he
said
,
that
by
the
time
SARS-CoV-2
reached
the
market
,
it
had
been
circulating
for
awhile
in
Wuhan
or
beyond
.
The
market
viruses
,
he
argued
,
aren
’
t
representative
of
full
diversity
of
coronaviruses
already
loose
in
late
2019.
“
Maybe
our
picture
of
what
was
present
early
in
Wuhan
from
what
has
been
sequenced
might
be
somewhat
biased
,
”
he
said.In
his
report
,
Dr.
Bloom
acknowledged
that
this
conclusion
would
have
to
be
confirmed
with
a
deeper
analysis
of
the
virus
sequences
.
Dr.
Worobey
said
that
he
and
his
colleagues
are
working
on
a
large-scale
study
of
SARS-CoV-2
genes
to
better
understand
its
origin
and
that
they
’
ll
now
add
Dr.
Bloom
’
s
13
recovered
sequences.
“
These
additional
data
will
play
a
big
role
in
that
effort
,
”
Dr.
Worobey
said.It
’
s
not
clear
why
this
valuable
information
went
missing
in
the
first
place
.
Scientists
can
request
that
files
be
deleted
by
sending
an
email
to
the
managers
of
the
Sequence
Read
Archive
.
The
National
Library
of
Medicine
,
which
manages
the
archive
,
said
that
the
13
sequences
were
removed
last
summer.
“
These
SARS-CoV-2
sequences
were
submitted
for
posting
in
SRA
in
March
2020
and
subsequently
requested
to
be
withdrawn
by
the
submitting
investigator
in
June
2020
,
”
said
Renate
Myles
,
a
spokeswoman
for
the
National
Institutes
of
Health.She
said
that
the
investigator
,
whom
she
did
not
name
,
told
the
archive
managers
that
the
sequences
were
being
updated
and
would
be
added
to
a
different
database
.
But
Dr.
Bloom
has
searched
every
database
he
knows
of
,
and
has
yet
to
find
them
.
“
Obviously
I
can
’
t
rule
out
that
the
sequences
are
on
some
other
database
or
web
page
somewhere
,
but
I
have
not
been
able
to
find
them
any
of
the
obvious
places
I
’
ve
looked
,
”
he
said.Three
of
the
co-authors
of
the
2020
testing
study
that
produced
the
13
sequences
did
not
immediately
respond
to
emails
inquiring
about
Dr.
Bloom
’
s
finding
.
That
study
did
not
give
contact
information
for
another
co-author
,
Dr.
Fu
,
who
was
also
named
on
the
spreadsheet
from
the
other
study.Some
scientists
are
skeptical
that
there
is
anything
sinister
behind
the
removal
of
the
sequences
.
“
I
don
’
t
really
understand
how
this
points
to
a
cover-up
,
”
said
Stephen
Goldstein
,
a
virologist
at
the
University
of
Utah.Dr
.
Goldstein
noted
that
the
testing
paper
listed
the
individual
mutations
the
Wuhan
researchers
found
in
their
tests
.
Although
the
full
sequences
are
no
longer
in
the
archive
,
the
key
information
has
been
public
for
over
a
year
,
he
said
.
It
was
just
tucked
away
in
a
format
that
is
hard
for
researchers
to
find.
“
We
all
missed
this
relatively
obscure
paper
,
”
Dr.
Goldstein
said.
“
You
can
’
t
really
say
why
they
were
removed
,
”
Dr.
Bloom
acknowledged
in
an
interview
.
“
You
can
say
that
the
practical
consequence
of
removing
them
was
that
people
didn
’
t
notice
they
existed.
”
He
also
noted
that
the
Chinese
government
ordered
the
destruction
of
a
number
of
early
samples
of
the
virus
and
barred
the
publication
of
papers
on
the
coronavirus
without
its
approval.For
his
part
,
Dr.
Worobey
still
wants
answers
.
“
I
hope
we
hear
from
the
authors
who
generated
,
but
then
deleted
,
these
crucial
sequences
so
we
can
understand
more
about
their
motivation
for
doing
so
,
”
he
said
.
“
It
certainly
is
strange
at
face
value
and
really
demands
an
explanation.
”
Regardless
of
what
happened
to
these
13
sequences
,
Dr.
Bloom
now
wonders
what
other
clues
might
be
discovered
online
.
In
order
to
reconstruct
the
origin
of
Covid-19
,
all
those
clues
potentially
matter.
“
Ideally
,
we
need
to
try
to
find
as
many
other
early
sequences
as
possible
,
”
he
said
.
“
And
I
think
this
study
suggests
that
we
should
look
everywhere.
”
The
super-contagious
Delta
variant
of
the
coronavirus
is
now
responsible
for
about
one
in
every
five
Covid-19
cases
in
the
United
States
,
and
its
prevalence
has
doubled
in
the
last
two
weeks
,
health
officials
said
on
Tuesday.First
identified
in
India
,
Delta
is
one
of
several
“
variants
of
concern
,
”
as
designated
by
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
and
the
World
Health
Organization
.
It
has
spread
rapidly
through
India
and
Britain.Its
appearance
in
the
United
States
is
not
surprising
.
And
with
vaccinations
ticking
up
and
Covid-19
case
numbers
falling
,
it
’
s
unclear
how
much
of
a
problem
Delta
will
cause
here
.
Still
,
its
swift
rise
has
prompted
concerns
that
it
might
jeopardize
the
nation
’
s
progress
in
beating
back
the
pandemic.
“
The
Delta
variant
is
currently
the
greatest
threat
in
the
U.S.
to
our
attempt
to
eliminate
Covid-19
,
”
Dr.
Anthony
S.
Fauci
,
the
nation
’
s
leading
infectious
disease
expert
,
said
at
the
briefing
.
The
good
news
,
he
said
,
is
that
the
vaccines
authorized
in
the
United
States
work
against
the
variant
.
“
We
have
the
tools
,
”
he
said
.
“
So
let
’
s
use
them
,
and
crush
the
outbreak.
”
Here
are
answers
to
some
common
questions
about
the
Delta
variant.Delta
,
formerly
known
as
B.1.617.2
,
is
believed
to
be
the
most
transmissible
variant
yet
,
spreading
more
easily
than
both
the
original
strain
of
the
virus
and
the
Alpha
variant
first
identified
in
Britain
.
Public
health
officials
there
have
said
that
Delta
could
be
50
percent
more
contagious
than
Alpha
,
though
precise
estimates
of
its
infectiousness
vary.Other
evidence
suggests
that
the
variant
may
be
able
to
partially
evade
the
antibodies
made
by
the
body
after
a
coronavirus
infection
or
vaccination
.
And
the
variant
may
also
render
certain
monoclonal
antibody
treatments
less
effective
,
the
C.D.C
.
notes.Delta
may
also
cause
more
severe
illness
.
A
recent
Scottish
study
,
for
instance
,
found
that
people
infected
by
the
Delta
variant
were
roughly
twice
as
likely
to
be
hospitalized
than
were
those
infected
with
Alpha
.
But
uncertainties
remain
,
scientists
said.
“
The
severe
disease
piece
I
think
is
the
one
question
that
really
hasn
’
t
been
answered
yet
,
”
said
Dr.
Michael
Osterholm
,
director
of
the
Center
for
Infectious
Disease
Research
and
Policy
at
the
University
of
Minnesota.Delta
has
been
reported
in
80
countries
.
It
is
now
the
most
common
variant
in
India
and
Britain
,
where
it
accounts
for
more
than
90
percent
of
cases.Delta
was
first
identified
in
the
United
States
in
March
.
Although
Alpha
remains
the
most
prevalent
variant
here
,
Delta
has
spread
quickly
.
In
early
April
,
Delta
represented
just
0.1
percent
of
cases
in
the
United
States
,
according
to
the
C.D.C
.
By
early
May
,
the
variant
accounted
for
1.3
percent
of
cases
,
and
by
early
June
,
that
figure
had
jumped
to
9.5
percent
.
As
of
a
few
days
ago
,
the
estimate
hit
20.6
percent
,
Dr.
Fauci
said
at
the
briefing.The
Delta
variant
is
unlikely
to
pose
much
risk
to
people
who
have
been
fully
vaccinated
,
experts
said.
“
If
you
’
re
fully
vaccinated
,
I
would
largely
not
worry
about
it
,
”
said
Dr.
Ashish
K.
Jha
,
dean
of
the
Brown
University
School
of
Public
Health.According
to
one
recent
study
,
the
Pfizer-BioNTech
vaccine
was
88
percent
effective
at
protecting
against
symptomatic
disease
caused
by
Delta
,
nearly
matching
its
93
percent
effectiveness
against
the
Alpha
variant
.
But
a
single
dose
of
the
vaccine
was
just
33
percent
effective
against
Delta
,
the
study
found.
“
Fully
immunized
individuals
should
do
well
with
this
new
phase
of
the
epidemic
,
”
said
Dr.
Peter
Hotez
,
dean
of
the
National
School
of
Tropical
Medicine
at
Baylor
College
of
Medicine
.
“
However
,
the
protection
offered
by
a
single
dose
appears
low
,
and
of
course
if
you
are
not
at
all
vaccinated
,
consider
yourself
at
high
risk.
”
Delta
is
likely
to
infect
“
large
numbers
”
of
unvaccinated
people
,
he
said.The
pandemic
is
waning
in
the
United
States
,
with
cases
,
hospitalizations
and
deaths
all
on
the
decline
.
The
seven-day
case
average
,
roughly
10,350
a
day
,
is
the
lowest
since
March
2020
,
Dr.
Rochelle
Walensky
,
director
of
the
C.D.C.
,
said
at
the
briefing
on
Tuesday
.
“
These
numbers
demonstrate
the
extraordinary
progress
we
’
ve
made
against
a
formidable
foe
,
”
she
said.So
while
Delta
may
account
for
an
increasing
percentage
of
cases
,
it
is
not
yet
clear
whether
it
will
drive
the
total
number
of
cases
higher.
“
I
think
we
are
not
going
to
see
another
big
,
national
surge
in
the
United
States
because
we
have
enough
vaccination
to
prevent
that
,
”
Dr.
Osterholm
said.Still
,
vaccination
rates
have
been
highly
uneven
,
and
are
lower
in
certain
states
and
demographic
groups
.
Delta
could
fuel
outbreaks
in
the
South
,
where
vaccinations
lag
,
or
among
young
people
,
who
are
less
likely
to
be
vaccinated
than
their
elders.
“
In
places
where
there
’
s
still
a
lot
of
susceptibility
to
the
virus
,
it
opens
a
window
for
cases
to
start
going
up
again
,
”
said
Justin
Lessler
,
an
infectious
disease
epidemiologist
at
Johns
Hopkins
University
.
“
But
even
in
those
states
,
and
certainly
nationally
,
we
’
re
probably
not
getting
back
to
the
numbers
we
were
seeing
last
winter.
”
Still
,
he
said
,
it
could
prolong
our
path
out
of
the
pandemic
.
“
It
continues
the
doldrums
,
”
he
said.Get
vaccinated
.
If
you
’
re
already
vaccinated
,
encourage
your
family
,
friends
and
neighbors
to
get
vaccinated
.
Vaccination
is
likely
to
slow
the
spread
of
all
the
variants
and
reduce
the
odds
that
new
,
even
more
dangerous
variants
emerge.
“
I
encourage
people
who
are
vaccinated
to
trust
in
the
vaccines
but
be
cognizant
that
new
variants
will
continue
to
occur
where
transmission
exists
,
”
said
Saskia
Popescu
,
an
infectious
disease
epidemiologist
at
George
Mason
University
.
“
So
it
’
s
really
about
ensuring
local
,
national
and
global
vaccination.
”
At
a
Senate
hearing
on
efforts
to
combat
Covid-19
last
month
,
Senator
Rand
Paul
of
Kentucky
asked
Dr.
Anthony
S.
Fauci
whether
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
had
funded
“
gain-of-function
”
research
on
coronaviruses
in
China.
“
Gain-of-function
research
,
as
you
know
,
is
juicing
up
naturally
occurring
animal
viruses
to
infect
humans
,
”
the
senator
said.Dr
.
Fauci
,
the
nation
’
s
top
infectious
disease
expert
,
flatly
rejected
the
claim
:
“
Senator
Paul
,
with
all
due
respect
,
you
are
entirely
and
completely
incorrect
,
that
the
N.I.H
.
has
not
ever
and
does
not
now
fund
gain-of-function
research
in
the
Wuhan
Institute.
”
This
exchange
,
and
the
bit
of
scientific
jargon
at
the
heart
of
it
,
has
gained
traction
in
recent
weeks
,
usually
by
people
suggesting
that
the
coronavirus
was
engineered
,
rather
than
having
jumped
from
animals
to
humans
,
the
explanation
favored
by
most
experts
on
coronaviruses
.
The
uproar
has
also
drawn
attention
back
to
a
decade-long
debate
among
scientists
over
whether
certain
gain-of-function
research
is
too
risky
to
allow.Spurred
by
some
contested
bird
flu
experiments
in
2012
,
the
U.S.
government
adjusted
its
policies
for
oversight
of
certain
types
of
pathogen
studies
.
But
some
critics
in
the
scientific
community
say
that
the
policy
is
overly
restrictive
and
that
its
enforcement
has
been
far
from
transparent.The
stakes
of
the
debate
could
not
be
higher
.
Too
little
research
on
emerging
viruses
will
leave
us
unprepared
for
future
pandemics
.
But
too
little
attention
to
the
safety
risks
will
increase
the
chances
that
an
experimental
pathogen
may
escape
a
lab
through
an
accident
and
cause
an
outbreak
of
its
own.Sorting
out
the
balance
of
risks
and
benefits
of
the
research
has
proved
over
the
years
to
be
immensely
challenging
.
And
now
,
the
intensity
of
the
politics
and
rhetoric
over
the
lab
leak
theory
threatens
to
push
detailed
science
policy
discussions
to
the
sidelines.
“
It
’
s
just
going
to
make
it
harder
to
get
back
to
a
serious
debate
,
”
said
Marc
Lipsitch
,
an
epidemiologist
at
the
Harvard
T.H
.
Chan
School
of
Public
Health
who
has
urged
the
government
to
be
more
transparent
about
its
support
of
gain-of-function
research.In
the
1970s
,
researchers
were
learning
for
the
first
time
to
move
genes
from
one
organism
to
another
to
make
bacteria
produce
human
insulin
.
From
the
start
,
critics
worried
that
such
experiments
could
accidentally
create
deadly
pathogens
if
they
escaped
from
labs.Tinkering
with
genes
isn
’
t
the
only
way
that
a
scientist
can
give
an
organism
new
abilities
.
Researchers
can
also
stage
evolutionary
experiments
,
in
which
pathogens
are
grown
in
the
cells
of
an
unfamiliar
host
species
.
At
first
,
they
don
’
t
replicate
well
.
But
new
mutations
can
help
them
adapt
,
gradually
improving
their
performance.A
decade
ago
,
researchers
used
serial
passage
,
as
this
procedure
is
known
,
to
learn
how
new
strains
of
influenza
evolve
.
Flu
strains
start
off
in
the
guts
of
birds
,
and
sometimes
manage
to
mutate
into
a
form
that
can
spread
among
people.Two
teams
of
researchers
—
one
from
the
University
of
Wisconsin
in
Madison
and
the
other
at
Erasmus
Medical
Center
in
Rotterdam
,
the
Netherlands
—
designed
experiments
to
identify
which
genetic
mutations
were
essential
for
a
successful
jump
from
birds
to
people
.
They
injected
bird
flu
viruses
into
the
noses
of
ferrets
,
waited
for
the
viruses
to
replicate
,
and
then
transferred
the
new
viruses
to
new
ferrets
.
Soon
the
viruses
evolved
to
become
better
at
replicating
in
the
ferrets.When
news
of
the
experiments
broke
in
late
2011
,
a
controversy
exploded
.
Some
critics
said
the
research
was
reckless
and
shouldn
’
t
be
published
,
for
fear
that
other
researchers
would
copy
the
work
and
accidentally
release
a
new
pandemic
strain
of
flu.A
year
later
,
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
held
a
meeting
to
consider
what
it
called
“
gain-of-function
research.
”
The
name
took
hold
,
but
scientific
experts
have
grown
increasingly
frustrated
with
it
ever
since.
“
It
’
s
a
horribly
imprecise
term
,
”
said
Gigi
Gronvall
,
a
senior
scholar
at
the
Johns
Hopkins
Center
for
Health
Security.Many
gain-of-function
experiments
could
never
pose
an
existential
threat
;
instead
,
they
have
provided
huge
benefits
to
humanity
.
In
1937
,
researchers
found
that
when
they
passed
the
yellow
fever
virus
through
chicken
cells
,
it
lost
the
ability
to
cause
disease
in
humans
—
a
discovery
that
led
to
a
vaccine
for
yellow
fever
.
Likewise
,
herpes
viruses
have
been
engineered
to
gain
a
new
function
of
their
own
:
attacking
cancer
cells
.
They
’
re
now
an
approved
treatment
for
melanoma.But
the
bird
flu
experiments
raised
concerns
that
certain
gain-of-function
studies
could
pose
a
tiny
but
real
risk
of
dangerous
outbreaks
.
In
2014
,
U.S.
officials
announced
that
18
such
studies
would
be
paused
.
The
experiments
were
not
just
on
influenza
viruses
,
but
on
the
coronaviruses
that
caused
SARS
and
MERS.Three
years
later
,
the
government
rolled
out
a
new
policy
—
the
“
P3CO
framework
”
—
for
research
on
“
enhanced
potential
pandemic
pathogens.
”
The
rule
requires
the
agencies
under
the
H.H.S
.
umbrella
,
like
N.I.H
.
and
its
several
institutes
,
to
carry
out
a
special
review
of
grant
applications
for
any
research
on
“
a
credible
source
of
a
potential
future
human
pandemic.
”
In
2019
,
after
conducting
such
a
scientific
review
,
the
agency
gave
the
green
light
for
two
influenza
projects
to
restart
,
triggering
more
debate
about
whether
its
policy
was
thorough
enough.When
questioning
Dr.
Fauci
last
month
,
Senator
Paul
brought
up
one
of
the
most
cited
examples
of
gain-of-function
research
,
a
study
of
coronaviruses
done
by
Ralph
Baric
at
the
University
of
North
Carolina
published
in
Nature
Medicine
in
2015
.
Working
with
data
sent
from
Shi
Zhengli
,
the
director
of
the
Wuhan
Institute
of
Virology
,
Dr.
Baric
and
his
colleagues
built
a
new
coronavirus
from
an
existing
one
.
All
of
the
work
was
done
in
the
North
Carolina
lab
,
and
neither
Dr.
Shi
nor
members
of
her
lab
participated.The
so-called
chimeric
virus
that
resulted
was
not
more
pathogenic
than
the
parental
virus
,
Dr.
Baric
said
.
“
This
work
was
approved
by
the
N.I.H
..
,
was
peer-reviewed
,
P3CO
reviewed
and
approved
,
”
Dr.
Baric
wrote
in
an
email
last
month
.
The
work
also
“
involved
a
very
different
strain
of
beta
coronavirus
than
the
one
that
causes
Covid-19
,
”
he
said
,
and
was
considered
low
risk
because
of
the
particular
strain
in
question.In
the
paper
,
he
and
his
colleagues
cautioned
others
about
similar
research
.
“
The
potential
to
prepare
for
and
mitigate
future
outbreaks
must
be
weighed
against
the
risk
of
creating
more
dangerous
pathogens
,
”
they
wrote.The
P3CO
policy
has
a
significant
shortcoming
,
according
to
David
Relman
,
a
member
of
the
U.S.
National
Science
Advisory
Board
for
Biosecurity
and
a
microbiologist
at
Stanford
University
:
It
only
applies
to
the
grant
process
in
agencies
that
are
part
of
H.H.S
.
Grants
from
the
National
Science
Foundation
,
the
Pentagon
or
other
agencies
could
include
dangerous
research
and
also
need
oversight
,
he
said
.
Then
there
is
the
even
thornier
question
of
private
research
,
not
funded
by
the
government.Dr
.
Relman
has
also
criticized
the
government
’
s
process
for
screening
and
approving
gain-of-function
research
.
At
a
January
2020
meeting
of
the
advisory
board
,
he
objected
to
the
lack
of
information
released
about
how
two
research
proposals
were
approved.Rozanne
Sandri-Golin
,
editor
in
chief
of
the
Journal
of
Virology
,
a
scientist
who
works
on
the
herpes
virus
and
a
fellow
member
of
the
board
,
said
Dr.
Relman
made
a
strong
case
about
the
lack
of
transparency
in
the
grant-screening
process
.
The
board
was
told
that
a
committee
made
the
decision
but
“
their
names
weren
’
t
published
,
their
backgrounds
weren
’
t
published
and
the
process
that
they
used
for
deciding
whether
or
not
it
was
going
to
be
all
right
to
now
proceed
with
this
research
was
not
clearly
defined
,
”
she
said.The
secrecy
of
the
screening
process
was
the
most
worrisome
part
of
government
oversight
of
potentially
dangerous
research
,
according
to
Angela
Rasmussen
,
a
virologist
at
University
of
Saskatchewan
’
s
Vaccine
and
Infectious
Disease
Organization
,
who
was
doing
research
in
the
United
States
at
that
time
.
“
It
’
s
not
clear
how
they
decide
what
’
s
acceptable
gain
of
function
and
what
’
s
not
,
”
she
said.However
,
the
“
star
chamber
”
nature
of
the
process
was
not
its
biggest
problem
,
said
Richard
Ebright
,
a
molecular
biologist
at
Rutgers
who
has
also
been
one
of
the
most
vocal
proponents
of
the
lab
leak
theory
,
and
a
longtime
advocate
of
stricter
control
of
research
on
dangerous
pathogens
.
An
even
bigger
issue
,
he
said
,
was
that
gain-of-function
research
was
simply
not
being
screened
in
accordance
with
the
policy
established
by
H.H.S.
,
which
includes
the
National
Institute
of
Allergy
and
Infectious
Diseases
,
run
by
Dr.
Fauci.The
ideal
solution
,
he
said
,
would
be
the
creation
of
an
independent
body
to
provide
the
oversight
of
dangerous
pathogen
research
,
similar
to
what
the
Nuclear
Regulatory
Commission
does
for
studies
of
radioactive
materials.In
the
United
States
,
“
there
are
no
biosafety
rules
or
regulations
that
have
the
force
of
law
,
”
he
said
.
“
And
this
is
in
contrast
to
every
other
aspect
of
biomedical
research.
”
There
are
enforceable
rules
,
for
example
,
for
experiments
with
human
subjects
,
vertebrate
animals
,
radioactive
materials
and
lasers
,
but
none
for
research
with
disease-causing
organisms.Dr
.
Relman
,
who
also
supports
the
need
for
independent
regulation
,
cautioned
that
legal
restrictions
,
as
opposed
to
guidelines
or
more
flexible
regulations
,
could
also
pose
problems
.
“
The
law
is
cumbersome
and
slow
,
”
he
said
.
At
one
point
in
the
evolution
of
laws
relating
to
biological
warfare
,
for
example
,
Congress
prohibited
the
possession
of
smallpox
.
But
the
rule
’
s
language
,
Dr.
Relman
said
,
also
seemed
to
ban
possession
of
the
vaccine
because
of
its
genetic
similarity
to
the
virus
itself
.
“
To
try
to
fix
it
took
forever
,
”
he
said.The
current
H.H.S
.
policy
also
doesn
’
t
offer
much
guidance
about
working
with
scientists
in
other
countries
.
Some
have
different
policies
about
gain-of-function
research
,
while
others
have
none
at
all.Dr
.
Gronvall
of
Johns
Hopkins
argued
that
the
U.S.
government
can
not
dictate
what
scientists
do
in
other
parts
of
the
world
.
“
You
have
to
embrace
self-governance
,
”
she
said
.
“
You
’
re
not
able
to
sit
on
everyone
’
s
shoulder.
”
Even
if
other
countries
fall
short
on
gain-of-function
research
policies
,
Dr.
Lipsitch
said
that
shouldn
’
t
stop
the
United
States
from
developing
better
ones
.
As
the
world
’
s
leader
in
biomedical
research
,
the
country
could
set
an
example
.
“
The
United
States
is
sufficiently
central
,
”
Dr.
Lipsitch
said
.
“
What
we
do
really
does
matter.
”
Ironically
,
the
pandemic
put
deliberations
over
such
issues
on
hold
.
But
there
’
s
no
question
the
coronavirus
will
influence
the
shape
of
the
debate
.
Jesse
Bloom
,
a
virologist
at
the
Fred
Hutchinson
Cancer
Research
Center
,
said
that
before
the
pandemic
,
the
idea
of
a
new
virus
sweeping
the
world
and
causing
millions
of
deaths
felt
hypothetically
plausible
.
Now
he
has
seen
what
such
a
virus
can
do.
“
You
have
to
think
really
carefully
about
any
kind
of
research
that
could
lead
to
that
sort
of
mishap
in
the
future
,
”
Dr.
Bloom
said.In
December
,
British
researchers
discovered
that
a
new
variant
was
sweeping
through
their
country
.
When
it
arrived
in
other
countries
,
the
variant
,
now
known
as
Alpha
,
tended
to
become
more
common
in
its
new
homes
as
well
.
By
April
,
it
had
become
the
dominant
variant
in
the
United
States
,
and
it
has
remained
so
ever
since.Alpha
’
s
swift
success
has
left
scientists
wondering
how
the
variant
conquered
the
world
.
A
new
study
points
to
one
secret
to
its
success
:
Alpha
disables
the
first
line
of
immune
defense
in
our
bodies
,
giving
the
variant
more
time
to
multiply.
“
It
’
s
very
impressive
,
”
said
Dr.
Maudry
Laurent-Rolle
,
a
physician
and
virologist
at
the
Yale
School
of
Medicine
who
was
not
involved
in
the
new
study
.
“
Any
successful
virus
has
to
get
beyond
that
first
defense
system
.
The
more
successful
it
is
at
doing
that
,
the
better
off
the
virus
is.
”
The
report
was
posted
online
on
Monday
and
has
not
yet
been
published
in
a
scientific
journal.Alpha
has
23
mutations
that
set
it
apart
from
other
coronaviruses
.
When
the
variant
started
to
surge
in
Britain
,
researchers
began
inspecting
these
genetic
tweaks
to
look
for
explanations
as
to
why
it
was
spreading
faster
than
other
variants.A
lot
of
researchers
focused
their
attention
on
the
nine
mutations
that
alter
the
so-called
spike
protein
that
covers
the
coronavirus
and
allows
it
to
invade
cells
.
One
of
those
mutations
helps
the
virus
bind
more
tightly
to
cells
,
potentially
improving
its
chances
of
a
successful
infection.But
other
scientists
have
focused
on
how
Alpha
affects
the
human
immune
response
.
Gregory
Towers
,
a
virologist
at
the
University
College
London
,
and
his
colleagues
grew
coronaviruses
in
human
lung
cells
,
comparing
Alpha-infected
cells
with
those
infected
with
earlier
variants
of
the
coronavirus.They
found
that
lung
cells
with
Alpha
made
drastically
less
interferon
,
a
protein
that
switches
on
a
host
of
immune
defenses
.
They
also
found
that
in
the
Alpha
cells
,
the
defensive
genes
normally
switched
on
by
interferon
were
quieter
than
in
cells
infected
with
other
variants.Somehow
,
the
immune
system
’
s
most
important
alarm
bells
were
barely
ringing
in
the
presence
of
the
Alpha
variant
.
“
It
’
s
making
itself
more
invisible
,
”
Dr
.
Towers
said.To
investigate
how
Alpha
achieved
this
invisibility
,
the
researchers
looked
at
how
the
coronavirus
replicated
inside
of
infected
cells
.
They
found
that
Alpha-infected
cells
make
a
lot
of
extra
copies
—
some
80
times
more
than
other
versions
of
the
virus
—
of
a
gene
called
Orf9b.
“
It
’
s
off
the
chart
,
”
said
Nevan
Krogan
,
a
molecular
biologist
at
the
University
of
California
,
San
Francisco
,
and
a
co-author
of
the
new
study.In
previous
research
,
Dr.
Krogan
and
his
colleagues
had
found
that
Orf9b
makes
a
viral
protein
that
locks
onto
a
human
protein
called
Tom70
.
And
it
just
so
happens
that
Tom70
is
essential
for
a
cell
’
s
release
of
interferon
in
the
face
of
an
invading
virus.Putting
all
of
the
evidence
together
,
Dr.
Krogan
and
his
colleagues
argue
that
the
Alpha
variant
carries
a
mutation
that
forces
the
production
of
a
lot
more
Orf9b
proteins
.
Those
proteins
swarm
the
human
Tom70
proteins
,
dampening
the
production
of
interferon
and
a
full
immune
response
.
The
virus
,
protected
from
attack
,
has
better
odds
of
making
copies
of
itself.An
infected
cell
can
gradually
remove
the
Orf9b
proteins
from
its
Tom70
molecules
,
however
.
By
about
12
hours
after
infection
,
the
alarm
system
starts
coming
back
online
.
And
because
of
that
immune
response
,
Dr
.
Towers
said
,
“
all
hell
breaks
loose.
”
Dr
.
Towers
speculated
that
when
the
delayed
immune
response
finally
happens
,
people
infected
with
Alpha
have
a
more
robust
reaction
than
they
would
with
other
variants
,
coughing
and
shedding
virus-laden
mucus
from
not
only
their
mouths
,
but
also
their
noses
—
making
Alpha
even
better
at
spreading.
“
What
they
’
re
showing
makes
sense
,
”
Dr.
Laurent-Rolle
said
.
But
she
would
like
to
see
more
lines
of
evidence
in
support
of
their
conclusion
.
For
example
,
the
scientists
did
not
run
a
standard
test
to
measure
the
number
of
Orf9b
proteins.
“
That
’
s
one
thing
that
could
be
concerning
,
”
she
said
.
Dr.
Krogan
said
he
and
his
colleagues
were
developing
that
test
now.Dr
.
Krogan
’
s
team
has
also
started
similar
experiments
on
other
variants
,
including
the
variant
first
identified
in
South
Africa
,
known
as
Beta
,
and
the
one
first
identified
in
India
,
known
as
Delta
.
The
preliminary
results
surprised
them.Both
Beta
and
Delta
drive
down
interferon
in
infected
cells
.
But
there
’
s
no
sign
that
they
do
so
by
flooding
the
cells
with
Orf9b
proteins
.
They
may
have
independently
evolved
their
own
tricks
for
manipulating
our
immune
system.
“
They
’
re
all
turning
down
the
immune
response
in
different
ways
,
”
Dr.
Krogan
said.Cecile
King
,
an
immunologist
at
the
University
of
New
South
Wales
in
Sydney
,
Australia
,
who
was
not
involved
in
the
study
,
said
that
understanding
how
the
virus
was
evolving
these
escapes
would
help
scientists
design
better
vaccines
for
Covid-19.The
current
crop
of
vaccines
direct
the
immune
system
to
recognize
spike
proteins
.
But
studies
on
people
who
recover
naturally
from
Covid-19
have
shown
that
their
immune
systems
learn
to
recognize
other
viral
proteins
,
including
Orf9b.A
number
of
researchers
are
putting

But
they
need
to
take
caution

because
some
of
the

may
actually
dampen
immunity.
“
It

s
quite
a
tricky
enterprise
,
but
becoming
more
possible
as
we

”
Dr.
King
said.FRESNO
,
Calif.
—
On
a
Tuesday
afternoon
in
April
,
among
tables
of
vegetables
,
clothes
and
telephone
chargers
at
Fresno
’
s
biggest
outdoor
flea
market
were
prescription
drugs
being
sold
as
treatments
for
Covid.Vendors
sold
$
25
injections
of
the
steroid
dexamethasone
,
several
kinds
of
antibiotics
and
the
anti-parasitic
drug
ivermectin
.
Chloroquine
and
hydroxychloroquine
—
the
malaria
drugs
pushed
by
President
Donald
J.
Trump
last
year
—
make
regular
appearances
at
the
market
as
well
,
as
do
sham
herbal
supplements.Health
and
consumer
protection
agencies
have
repeatedly
warned
that
several
of
these
treatments
,
as
well
as
vitamin
infusions
and
expensive
injections
of
“
peptide
therapies
”
sold
at
alternative
wellness
clinics
for
more
than
$
1,000
,
are
not
supported
by
reliable
scientific
evidence.But
such
unproven
remedies
,
often
promoted
by
doctors
and
companies
on
social
media
,
have
appealed
to
many
people
in
low-income
immigrant
communities
in
places
across
the
country
where
Covid-19
rates
have
been
high
but
access
to
health
care
is
low
.
Some
turn
to
unregulated
drugs
because
mainstream
medicine
is
too
expensive
or
is
inaccessible
because
of
language
or
cultural
barriers.
“
It
’
s
disappointing
but
not
surprising
”
that
people
living
below
the
poverty
line
have
spent
large
sums
of
money
for
unproven
treatments
for
Covid-19
,
said
Rais
Vohra
,
the
interim
head
of
Fresno
County
’
s
health
department
.
“
People
are
desperate
and
bombarded
with
misinformation
and
may
not
have
the
skills
,
time
or
context
to
interpret
medical
evidence.
”
The
trend
is
not
new
.
In
2014
,
Dr.
Vohra
published
a
case
report
on
a
Hmong
woman
who
showed
up
at
an
emergency
room
in
Fresno
with
life-threatening
poisoning
after
overdosing
on
chloroquine
that
she
had
bought
at
the
flea
market
under
the
label
“
red
Tylenol.
”
He
and
his
colleagues
subsequently
went
to
the
market
and
to
three
smaller
shops
and
found
35
different
medications
that
were
prescription-only
or
had
been
deemed
unsafe
by
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
.
“
It
was
a
real
eye
opener
,
”
he
said.During
the
pandemic
,
many
immigrants
shut
out
of
mainstream
health
care
have
turned
to
such
markets
for
Covid-19
treatments
.
About
20
percent
of
Hispanic
people
in
the
United
States
lack
health
insurance
,
and
the
proportion
is
far
higher
among
undocumented
immigrants.What
’
s
more
,
some
immigrants
mistrust
doctors
who
don
’
t
speak
their
language
or
who
treat
them
curtly
—
and
those
concerns
have
been
amplified
by
harsh
political
rhetoric
directed
at
Mexicans
and
Central
Americans.
“
My
community
fears
that
the
government
might
be
trying
to
get
rid
of
us

said
Oralia
Maceda
Méndez
,
an
advocate
at
a
Fresno-based
community
group
for
Indigenous
people
from
Oaxaca
,
Mexico
.
She
has
heard
many
stories
from
immigrants
in
her
community
who
treat
themselves
for
Covid-19
with
penicillin
,
other
antibiotics
or
a
mix
of
vitamins
and
herbal
therapies
bought
from
shops
or
travelers
selling
medications
bought
in
Mexico.
“
I
am
not
surprised
that
people
are
taken
advantage
of
,
”
she
said
.
“
We
don

t
have
the
care
we
need.
”
Some
farmworkers
have
received
unproven
treatments
at
specialty
clinics
.
A
woman
in
Fresno
recently
described
how
her
husband
,
a
farmworker
,
had
fallen
so
sick
from
Covid-19
that
he
couldn
’
t
breathe
or
walk
,
but
he
refused
to
go
to
the
hospital
because
he
had
heard
rumors
that
undocumented
immigrants
had
checked
in
and
never
left
.
She
took
him
to
a
wellness
clinic
,
where
a
doctor
gave
him
injectable
peptide
treatments
,
recalled
the
woman
,
who
requested
anonymity
because
of
her
immigration
status.She
wasn
’
t
prepared
,
she
said
,
for
the
$
1,400
bill
,
which
included
the
cost
of
syringes
and
vials
labeled
thymosin-alpha
1
,
BPC-157
and
LL-37
.
Pulling
them
out
of
a
cabinet
in
the
kitchen
of
her
mobile
home
,
she
said
she
didn
’
t
know
exactly
what
they
were
,
and
she
still
feels
the
sting
of
the
price.
“
I
was
shocked
,
but
I
was
trying
to
act
like
it
was
OK
because
I
had
to
be
strong
for
my
husband
and
my
kids
,
”
she
said
.
He
grew
sicker
despite
the
injections
,
but
the
family
had
no
funds
left
for
care
.
More
than
a
month
passed
before
he
was
well
enough
to
return
to
the
fields.Sandra
Celedon
,
the
president
of
a
coalition
of
grass-roots
organizations
called
Fresno
Building
Health
Communities
,
said
she
and
her
colleagues
have
heard
from
several
farmworkers
and
other
low-income
Latino
immigrants
who
spent
their
savings
on
vitamin
infusions
and
peptide
therapies
for
Covid
.
“
These
folks
are
the
poorest
of
the
poor
,
and
yet
the
doctors
were
requesting
cash
for
their
unproven
treatments
,
”
she
said.Some
unregulated
drugs
can
be
dangerous
.
And
even
if
they
aren
’
t
a
health
risk
by
themselves
,
they
can
lead
people
to
postpone
seeking
help
from
doctors
,
which
can
be
deadly
.
Delayed
treatment
is
one
reason
Black
and
Hispanic
people
have
died
from
Covid
at
twice
the
rate
as
white
people
in
the
United
States.Alternative
therapies
can
also
limit
a
patient
’
s
treatment
options
because
doctors
worry
about
toxic
drug
interactions
,
said
Dr.
Kathleen
Page
,
an
infectious-disease
specialist
at
Johns

University
School
of
Medicine
in
Baltimore.Undocumented
immigrants
from
Mexico
and
Central
America
who
have
gone
to
the
emergency
room
at
her
hospital
often
mention
home
remedies
,
vitamins
or
antibiotics
they
have
injected
or
ingested
before
seeking
care
.
“
I
’
m
not
upset
at
patients
when
they
tell
me
what
they
’
ve
taken
,
”
Dr
.
Page
said
.
“
I

upset
about
the
system

get

from
regular
health
care.

”
he
said.When
Dr.
Bautista
came
down
with
Covid-19
himself
last
year
,
he
tried
peptides
,
along
with
a
host
of
standard
treatments
.
He
said
that
he
hadn
’
t
used
peptides
to
treat
Covid-19
in
his
patients
but
that
he
didn
’
t
fault
doctors
who
had
used
experimental
therapies
that
they
believed
could
help
people
recover
from
a
never-before-seen
virus.
“
Physicians
were
doing
everything
possible
to
keep
patients
outside
of
the
hospital
,
”
he
said
,
citing
the
distress
of
intubation
and
medical
bills
that
could
wipe
out
the
savings
of
his
low-income
patients
from
Fresno
and
the
broader
San
Joaquin

.
“
There
’
s
not
a

”
The
U.S.
government
spent
more
than
$
18
billion
last
year
funding
drugmakers
to
make
a
Covid
vaccine
,
an
effort
that
led
to
at
least
five
highly
effective
shots
in
record
time
.
Now
it
’
s
pouring
more
than
$
3
billion
on
a
neglected
area
of
research
:
developing
pills
to
fight
the
virus
early
in
the
course
of
infection
,
potentially
saving
many
lives
in
the
years
to
come.The
new
program
,
announced
on
Thursday
by
the
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
,
will
speed
up
the
clinical
trials
of
a
few
promising
drug
candidates
.
If
all
goes
well
,
some
of
those
first
pills
could
be
ready
by
the
end
of
the
year
.
The
Antiviral
Program
for
Pandemics
will
also
support
research
on
entirely
new
drugs
—
not
just
for
the
coronavirus
,
but
for
viruses
that
could
cause
future
pandemics.A
number
of
other
viruses
,
including
influenza
,
H.I.V
.
and
hepatitis
C
,
can
be
treated
with
a
simple
pill
.
But
despite
more
than
a
year
of
research
,
no
such
pill
exists
to
treat
someone
with
a
coronavirus
infection
before
it
wreaks
havoc
.
Operation
Warp
Speed
,
the
Trump
administration
’
s
program
for
accelerating
Covid-19
research
,
invested
far
more
money
in
the
development
of
vaccines
than
of
treatments
,
a
gap
that
the
new
program
will
try
to
fill.Dr
.
Anthony
Fauci
,
the
director
of
the
National
Institute
of
Allergy
and
Infectious
Diseases
and
a
key
backer
of
the
program
,
said
he
looked
forward
to
a
time
when
Covid-19
patients
could
pick
up
antiviral
pills
from
a
pharmacy
as
soon
as
they
tested
positive
for
the
coronavirus
or
develop
Covid-19
symptoms.
“
I
wake
up
in
the
morning
,
I
don
’
t
feel
very
well
,
my
sense
of
smell
and
taste
go
away
,
I
get
a
sore
throat
,
”
Dr.
Fauci
said
in
an
interview
.
“
I
call
up
my
doctor
and
I
say
,
‘
I
have
Covid
and
I
need
a
prescription.
’
”
Dr
.
Fauci
’
s
support
for
research
on
antiviral
pills
stems
from
his
own
experience
fighting
AIDS
three
decades
ago
.
In
the
1990s
,
his
institute
conducted
research
that
led
to
some
of
the
first
antiviral
pills
for
H.I.V.
,
“
protease
inhibitors
”
that
block
an
essential
virus
protein
and
can
keep
the
virus
at
bay
for
a
lifetime.In
the
early
2000s
,
researchers
found
that
an
antiviral
called
sofosbuvir
could
cure
hepatitis
C
close
to
100
percent
of
the
time
.
Tamiflu
,
a
pill
for
influenza
,
can
cut
the
time
it
takes
to
recover
from
an
infection
,
and
reduce
the
chances
that
a
bout
of
the
flu
will
land
someone
in
the
hospital.At
the
start
of
the
pandemic
,
researchers
began
testing
existing
antivirals
in
people
hospitalized
with
severe
Covid-19
.
But
many
of
those
trials
failed
to
show
any
benefit
from
the
antivirals
.
In
hindsight
,
the
choice
to
work
in
hospitals
was
a
mistake
.
Scientists
now
know
that
the
best
time
to
try
to
block
the
coronavirus
is
in
the
first
few
days
of
the
disease
,
when
the
virus
is
replicating
rapidly
and
the
immune
system
has
not
yet
mounted
a
defense.Many
people
crush
their
infection
and
recuperate
,
but
in
others
,
the
immune
system
misfires
and
starts
damaging
tissues
instead
of
viruses
.
It
’
s
this
self-inflicted
damage
that
sends
many
people
with
Covid-19
to
the
hospital
,
as
the
coronavirus
replication
is
tapering
off
.
So
a
drug
that
blocks
replication
early
in
an
infection
might
very
well
fail
in
a
trial
on
patients
who
have
progressed
to
later
stages
of
the
disease.So
far
,
only
one
antiviral
has
demonstrated
a
clear
benefit
to
people
in
hospitals
:
remdesivir
.
Originally
investigated
as
a
potential
cure
for
Ebola
,
the
drug
seems
to
shorten
the
course
of
Covid-19
when
given
intravenously
to
patients
.
In
October
,
it
became
the
first
—
and
so
far
,
the
only
—
antiviral
drug
to
gain
full
F.D.A
.
approval
to
treat
the
disease.Yet
remdesivir
’
s
performance
has
left
many
researchers
underwhelmed
.
In
November
,
the
World
Health
Organization
recommended
against
using
the
drug.Remdesivir
might
work
more
effectively
if
people
could
take
it
earlier
in
the
course
of
Covid-19
as
a
pill
.
But
in
its
approved
formulation
,
the
compound
doesn
’
t
work
orally
.
It
can
’
t
survive
the
passage
from
the
mouth
to
the
stomach
to
the
circulatory
system.Researchers
from
around
the
world
are
testing
other
antivirals
already
known
to
work
in
pill
form
.
One
such
compound
,
called
molnupiravir
,
was
developed
in
2019
by
researchers
at
Emory
University
and
has
been
tested
against
viruses
including
influenza
and
Venezuelan
equine
encephalitis
virus.In
partnership
with
Ridgeback
Biotherapeutics
of
Miami
,
the
Emory
team
carried
out
experiments
in
mice
that
were
so
impressive
that
Merck
approached
them
to
bring
the
drug
into
human
clinical
trials
for
Covid-19.
“
We
thought
this
molecule
was
really
amazing
,
”
said
Daria
Hazuda
,
vice
president
of
infectious
disease
and
vaccine
research
at
Merck.In
a
trial
of
hospitalized
patients
,
however
,
molnupiravir
seemed
to
have
no
effect
on
the
disease
.
In
April
,
the
companies
announced
they
were
scrapping
the
trial.
“
I
see
that
,
and
I
’
m
like
,
‘
Yeah
,
no
duh
,
’
”
said
Dr.
Tim
Sheahan
,
a
virologist
at
the
University
of
North
Carolina
.
“
It
’
s
not
surprising
to
me
that
those
kinds
of
medications
would
not
make
a
dramatic
improvement
in
someone
’
s
outcome
when
they
’
ve
been
sick
for
several
days.
”
The
companies
began
a
second
study
last
fall
,
this
time
testing
the
drug
on
people
recently
diagnosed
with
Covid-19
.
That
trial
is
continuing
,
and
Merck
is
recruiting
volunteers
with
a
higher
risk
of
infection
,
such
as
older
people
with
obesity
and
diabetes
.
Dr.
Hazuda
said
the
trial
should
deliver
clear
results
by
October.Last
year
,
the
government
’
s
funding
of
Covid-19
treatments
focused
on
a
handful
of
candidates
,
such
as
monoclonal
antibodies
and
remdesivir
.
Many
other
studies
on
antivirals
were
small
and
underfunded
.
In
January
,
the
incoming
Biden
administration
began
designing
a
new
program
dedicated
to
antiviral
pills.Last
week
saw
the
first
results
of
this
planning
.
The
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
announced
that
it
would
purchase
from
Merck
1.7
million
doses
of
molnupiravir
at
a
cost
of
$
1.2
billion
,
provided
that
the
current
trial
leads
to
authorization
by
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
.
The
government
may
seek
similar
deals
for
two
other
antivirals
far
along
in
clinical
trials
,
according
to
Dr.
David
Kessler
,
the
chief
science
officer
of
the
Biden
administration
’
s
Covid-19
response
team.The
hope
“
is
that
we
can
get
an
antiviral
by
the
end
of
the
fall
that
can
help
us
close
out
this
chapter
of
the
epidemic
,
”
Dr.
Kessler
said
in
an
interview.One
of
the
drugs
the
government
is
considering
is
AT-527
,
developed
by
Atea
Pharmaceuticals
.
The
compound
has
already
proven
safe
and
effective
as
a
treatment
for
hepatitis
C
,
and
early
studies
suggested
it
might
also
work
against
Covid-19
.
Roche
has
partnered
with
Atea
to
test
it
in
people
,
and
the
companies
are
currently
running
a
late-stage
clinical
trial.The
other
drug
on
the
government
’
s
radar
was
created
by
scientists
at
Pfizer
,
adapted
from
a
molecule
initially
designed
in
the
early
2000s
as
a
potential
drug
for
SARS
.
That
drug
had
sat
on
the
shelf
for
years
,
but
last
spring
,
the
scientists
decided
to
modify
its
structure
so
that
it
would
work
against
the
new
coronavirus
’
s
protease
.
More
than
200
Pfizer
researchers
joined
forces
on
the
effort
on
the
molecule
,
known
for
now
as
PF-07321332.The
drug
had
been
designed
to
be
taken
intravenously
,
but
the
Pfizer
researchers
succeeded
in
altering
its
structure
to
work
as
a
pill
.
When
mice
were
given
the
drug
orally
,
it
reached
high
enough
levels
in
the
body
to
block
the
coronavirus
.
Pfizer
launched
a
clinical
trial
in
March
to
study
its
safety
in
people
,
and
expects
to
move
to
later-stage
testing
next
month.Dr
.
Kessler
acknowledged
that
there
will
be
challenges
in
using
such
pills
to
drive
down
hospitalizations
and
deaths
from
Covid-19
.
People
will
need
to
gain
access
to
the
drugs
as
soon
as
they
test
positive
.
“
Your
testing
programs
are
going
to
have
to
be
linked
to
your
treatment
,
”
he
said.And
if
the
history
of
antiviral
research
is
any
guide
,
the
first
drugs
for
Covid-19
will
probably
only
offer
modest
benefit
against
the
disease
,
Dr.
Fauci
said
.
But
that
would
be
a
good
start.
“
With
all
of
these
drugs
that
we
’
ve
dealt
with
over
the
years
,
we
’
ve
never
hit
a
home
run
the
first
time
at
bat
,
”
Dr.
Fauci
said
.
“
A
line
drive
off
the
left-field
wall
to
start
would
be
really
good.
”
The
government
will
also
spend
up
to
$
1.2
billion
on
research
centers
where
scientists
will
carry
out
early-stage
studies
on
drugs
that
block
the
coronavirus
in
other
ways
.
Some
drugs
may
interfere
with
other
essential
viral
proteins
,
while
others
may
make
it
impossible
to
copy
the
virus
’
s
genes.Even
if
the
next
generation
of
pills
doesn
’
t
arrive
for
a
few
years
,
many
scientists
say
that
the
research
will
be
a
good
investment
.
“
It
could
help
with
this
pandemic
and
potentially
provide
a
first
line
of
defense
for
the
next
one
,
”
said
Mark
Namchuk
,
the
director
of
therapeutic
translation
at
Harvard
Medical
School.The
program
will
support
not
only
research
on
pills
that
work
against
coronaviruses
,
but
also
against
other
high-risk
pathogens
,
such
as
flaviviruses
,
which
cause
diseases
such
as
dengue
fever
and
West
Nile
fever
,
and
togaviruses
,
which
cause
mosquito-borne
diseases
like
chikungunya
and
eastern
equine
encephalitis.
“
There
will
always
be
a
threat
,
”
Dr.
Fauci
said
.
“
I
think
there
’
s
going
to
be
a
long-range
need
for
drugs.
”
On
the
heels
of
President
Biden
’
s
abrupt
order
to
U.S.
intelligence
agencies
to
investigate
the
origins
of
the
coronavirus
,
many
scientists
reacted
positively
,
reflecting
their
push
in
recent
weeks
for
more
information
about
the
work
of
a
virus
lab
in
Wuhan
,
China
.
But
they
cautioned
against
expecting
an
answer
in
the
three-month
time
frame
of
the
president
’
s
request.After
long
steering
clear
of
the
debate
,
some
influential
scientists
have
lately
become
more
open
to
expressing
uncertainties
about
the
origins
of
the
virus
.
If
the
two
most
vocal
poles
of
the
argument
are
natural
spillover
vs.
laboratory
leak
,
these
new
voices
have
added
a
third
point
of
view
:
a
resounding
undecided.
“
In
the
beginning
,
there
was
a
lot
of
pressure
against
speaking
up
,
because
it
was
tied
to
conspiracies
and
Trump
supporters
,
”
said
Akiko
Iwasaki
,
an
immunologist
at
Yale
University
.
“
There
was
very
little
rational
discussion
going
on
in
the
beginning.
”
Virologists
still
largely
lean
toward
the
theory
that
infected
animals
—
perhaps
a
bat
,
or
another
animal
raised
for
food
—
spread
the
virus
to
humans
outside
of
a
lab
.
There
is
no
direct
evidence
for
the
“
lab
leak
”
theory
that
Chinese
researchers
isolated
the
virus
,
which
then
infected
a
lab
worker.But
China
’
s
integral
role
in
a
joint
inquiry
with
the
World
Health
Organization
made
its
dismissal
of
the
lab
leak
theory
difficult
to
accept
,
Dr.
Iwasaki
and
17
other
scientists
argued
in
the
journal
Science
this
month.
“
I
typically
only
speak
about
a
topic
publicly
if
I
have
some
new
scientific
result
that
makes
me
confident
about
a
new
discovery
or
conclusion
,
”
said
one
of
the
organizers
of
that
letter
,
Jesse
Bloom
,
who
studies
the
evolution
of
viruses
at
the
Fred
Hutchinson
Cancer
Research
Center
.
“
In
the
case
of
SARS-CoV-2
origins
,
I
still
am
not
confident
about
what
happened.
”
But
“
as
time
went
on
,
it
became
clear
that
not
saying
anything
about
the
origins
was
being
interpreted
as
agreeing
with
the
idea
that
the
virus
definitely
originated
from
a
zoonosis
,
”
he
said
,
referring
to
an
animal
spillover.On
Wednesday
,
two
weeks
after
that
letter
was
published
,
President
Biden
called
on
intelligence
agencies
to
“
redouble
their
efforts
”
and
deliver
a
report
to
him
within
90
days
.
On
Thursday
Mr.
Biden
said
he
expected
to
release
the
report
to
the
public.While
researchers
generally
welcome
a
sustained
search
for
answers
,
some
warn
that
those
answers
may
not
arrive
any
time
soon
—
if
ever.
“
At
the
end
of
this
process
,
I
would
not
be
surprised
if
we
did
not
know
much
more
than
we
know
now
,
”
said
W.
Ian
Lipkin
,
a
virologist
at
the
Mailman
School
of
Public
Health
at
Columbia
University
who
was
one
of
the
first
U.S.
scientists
to
visit
China
in
early
2020
and
consult
with
public
health
authorities
there.China
’
s
lack
of
cooperation
with
the
W.H.O
.
has
long
fueled
suspicions
about
how
the
coronavirus
,
known
as
SARS-CoV-2
,
had
emerged
seemingly
from
nowhere
to
seize
the
world.In
February
2020
,
the
Chinese
government
agreed
to
host
a
scientific
mission
,
but
it
came
under
fire
from
critics
because
it
was
constructed
as
a
cooperative
study
with
international
experts
and
Chinese
scientists
,
and
the
Chinese
controlled
access
to
data
.
In
addition
,
the
mission
had
no
mandate
to
investigate
laboratories
where
research
on
viruses
was
conducted.In
early
days
,
speculations
even
circulated
that
a
Chinese
biological
warfare
program
had
produced
the
virus
.
In
March
2020
,
Dr.
Lipkin
and
colleagues
published
a
letter
in
which
they
dismissed
that
possibility.
“
There
was
no
evidence
to
suggest
this
had
been
weaponized
,
”
Dr.
Lipkin
said
.
“
I
haven
’
t
changed
my
view
on
that.
”
Evolution
was
more
than
capable
of
brewing
a
new
pandemic
virus
,
he
and
other
experts
said
.
Bats
and
many
other
animals
are
hosts
to
coronaviruses
.
When
an
animal
is
infected
by
two
strains
of
coronaviruses
,
they
can
swap
genetic
material
in
a
process
called
recombination.As
scientists
find
more
animal
coronaviruses
,
they
can
recognize
more
and
more
pieces
of
SARS-CoV-2
spread
out
among
them
.
Researchers
have
also
been
able
to
reconstruct
some
of
the
evolutionary
steps
by
which
SARS-CoV-2
evolved
into
a
potential
human
pathogen
while
it
was
still
infecting
animals.This
pattern
is
probably
one
that
’
s
been
followed
by
many
viruses
that
are
now
major
burdens
on
human
health
.
H.I.V.
,
for
example
,
most
likely
had
its
origin
in
the
early
1900s
,
when
hunters
in
West
Africa
got
infected
with
viruses
that
infected
chimpanzees
and
other
primates.But
some
scientists
thought
it
was
too
soon
to
conclude
something
similar
happened
in
the
case
of
SARS-CoV-2
.
After
all
,
the
coronavirus
first
came
to
light
in
the
city
of
Wuhan
,
home
to
the
Wuhan
Institute
of
Virology
,
where
researchers
study
dozens
of
strains
of
coronaviruses
collected
in
caves
in
southern
China.Still
,
that
a
top
lab
studying
this
family
of
viruses
happens
to
be
located
in
the
same
city
where
the
epidemic
emerged
could
very
well
be
a
coincidence
.
Wuhan
is
an
urban
center
larger
than
New
York
City
,
with
a
steady
flow
of
visitors
from
other
parts
of
China
.
It
also
has
many
large
markets
dealing
in
wildlife
brought
from
across
China
and
beyond
.
When
wild
animals
are
kept
in
close
quarters
,
viruses
have
an
opportunity
to
jump
from
species
to
species
,
sometimes
resulting
in
dangerous
recombinations
that
can
lead
to
new
diseases.That
lab
’
s
research
began
after
another
coronavirus
led
to
the
SARS
epidemic
in
2002
.
Researchers
soon
found
relatives
of
that
virus
,
called
SARS-CoV
,
in
bats
,
as
well
as
civet
cats
,
which
are
sold
in
Chinese
markets
.
The
discovery
opened
the
eyes
of
scientists
to
all
the
animal
coronaviruses
with
the
potential
of
spilling
over
the
species
line
and
starting
a
new
pandemic.Virologists
can
take
many
measures
to
reduce
the
risk
of
getting
infected
with
the
viruses
they
study
.
But
over
the
years
,
some
accidents
have
happened
.
Researchers
have
gotten
sick
,
and
they
’
ve
infected
others
with
their
experimental
viruses.In
2004
,
for
example
,
a
researcher
at
the
National
Institute
of
Virology
in
Beijing
got
infected
with
the
coronavirus
that
causes
SARS
.
She
passed
it
on
to
others
,
including
her
mother
,
who
died
from
the
infection.In
2020
,
the
origins
of
the
Covid-19
pandemic
became
a
new
front
in
a
long-running
debate
over
lab
security
,
one
that
turns
on
the
question
of
whether
the
risks
of
studying
and
sometimes
manipulating
animal
viruses
outweigh
the
potential
for
that
work
to
help
guard
against
future
outbreaks.
“
This
kind
of
research
has
been
controversial
,
”
said
Filippa
Lentzos
,
a
biosecurity
researcher
at
King
’
s
College
London.Chinese
scientists
and
government
officials
have
denied
that
the
Covid-19
pandemic
was
the
result
of
a
lab
leak
.
And
a
number
of
outside
scientists
also
dismissed
the
idea.Robert
Garry
,
a
virologist
at
Tulane
Medical
School
and
a
co-author
of
Dr.
Lipkin
’
s
letter
,
observed
that
Chinese
scientists
would
have
to
have
collected
SARS-CoV-2
and
then
grown
it
in
a
colony
of
cells
,
but
somehow
never
publish
any
details
of
it
even
as
they
published
reports
on
other
coronaviruses
for
years.
“
It
makes
no
sense
to
me
.
Why
did
they
hold
onto
the
virus
?
”
Dr.
Garry
said.Other
scientists
felt
that
,
at
the
very
least
,
the
possibility
of
a
lab
leak
should
be
explored
.
But
when
Trump
administration
officials
claimed
the
virus
might
be
a
bioweapon
,
some
researchers
said
,
it
cast
a
shadow
over
the
idea
of
a
lab
leak.Those
researchers
pinned
their
hopes
on
a
joint
inquiry
by
the
W.H.O
.
and
China
,
even
as
the
Chinese
government
repeatedly
tried
to
bend
the
investigation
to
its
advantage.At
the
same
time
,
believers
in
the
possibility
of
a
lab
leak
were
trying
to
prepare
the
ground
for
scientists
to
speak
more
openly
about
their
misgivings
.
In
a
series
of
open
letters
,
a
collection
of
researchers
that
became
known
as
the
Paris
group
took
pains
to
express
concerns
about
the
joint
inquiry
and
uncertainty
over
the
virus
’
s
origins
without
overtly
selling
the
lab
leak
theory.
“
I
toned
down
some
of
the
letters
myself
,
”
said
Nikolai
Petrovsky
,
a
professor
of
medicine
at
Flinders
University
in
Australia
.
“
The
minute
we
went
too
far
down
the
path
that
we
think
it
’
s
a
lab
leak
,
it
was
just
going
to
be
crucified.
”
In
March
2021
,
the
W.H.O.-China
team
released
a
report
that
dedicated
only
four
out
of
313
pages
to
the
possibility
of
a
lab
leak
,
without
any
substantial
data
to
back
up
their
conclusion
that
it
was
highly
unlikely.Dr
.
Iwasaki
and
like-minded
scientists
decided
they
had
to
push
back
with
their
own
letter
.
“
We
feel
that
it
’
s
really
time
to
speak
up
about
it
,
and
get
more
science
behind
what
’
s
going
on
,
”
she
said.Yet
Dr.
Iwasaki
stressed
that
she
did
not
see
a
clear
case
for
a
lab
leak
.
“
I
’
m
completely
open-minded
about
the
possibilities
,
”
she
said
.
“
There
’
s
so
little
evidence
for
either
of
these
things
,
that
it
’
s
almost
like
a
tossup.
”
Marc
Lipsitch
,
an
epidemiologist
at
the
Harvard
T.H
.
Chan
School
of
Public
Health
and
co-author
of
the
letter
with
Dr.
Iwasaki
,
said
that
it
made
other
scientists
more
comfortable
talking
about
what
they
did
and
did
not
yet
know
about
the
pandemic
’
s
origins
.
“
That
’
s
what
we
wanted
to
have
happen
,
”
he
said.Speaking
recently
to
the
former
New
York
Times
journalist
Donald
McNeil
Jr.
,
Dr.
Lipkin
said
he
was
dismayed
to
learn
of
two
coronavirus
studies
from
the
Wuhan
Institute
of
Virology
that
had
been
carried
out
with
only
a
modest
level
of
safety
measures
,
known
as
BSL-2.In
an
interview
with
The
Times
,
Dr.
Lipkin
said
this
fact
wasn
’
t
proof
in
itself
that
SARS-CoV-2
spread
from
the
lab
.
“
But
it
certainly
does
raise
the
possibility
that
must
be
considered
,
”
he
said.A
BSL-2
level
of
research
would
also
add
to
the
difficulty
researchers
will
face
trying
to
pin
down
clear
evidence
that
a
coronavirus
infected
the
staff
.
At
higher
levels
of
security
,
staff
regularly
give
blood
samples
that
can
be
studied
later
for
genetic
material
from
viruses
and
antibodies
against
them
.
There
may
be
no
such
record
for
SARS-CoV-2.A
number
of
researchers
remain
unpersuaded
by
the
possibility
of
a
lab
leak
.
“
This
pathway
remains
the
least
likely
of
all
for
the
origin
of
COVID-19
,
”
said
Peter
Daszak
,
a
virologist
at
EcoHealth
Alliance
who
has
worked
frequently
with
the
Wuhan
virologists.
“
On
the
other
hand
,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
evidence
that
these
viruses
originate
in
wildlife
,
and
have
previously
and
repeatedly
infected
people
who
are
highly
exposed
to
these
animals
,
work
in
the
wildlife
trade
or
in
wildlife
farms
and
markets
,
”
Dr.
Daszak
said.Earlier
this
month
,
Dr.
Garry
of
Tulane
argued
that
the
genetic
variations
in
early
cases
of
Covid-19
in
Wuhan
could
be
explained
by
wild
animals
being
brought
to
animal
markets
in
the
city
.
“
If
you
suppose
that
the
viruses
came
in
through
the
wildlife
trade
,
then
it
’
s
pretty
simple
and
straightforward
,
”
he
said.Even
if
SARS-CoV-2
jumped
from
bats
or
other
animals
to
humans
outside
of
a
lab
,
as
Dr.
Garry
suspects
,
it
will
be
hard
to
find
airtight
proof
for
that
pathway
.
When
animals
die
,
they
take
their
viruses
with
them.While
scientists
have
fairly
good
evidence
for
how
two
coronaviruses
—
the
cause
of
SARS
and
MERS
—
jumped
from
bats
to
humans
,
the
origins
of
the
other
four
coronaviruses
that
infect
humans
remain
a
mystery.
“
Sometimes
you
get
lucky
,
sometimes
you
don
’
t
,
”
Dr.
Garry
said
.
“
It
can
take
decades.
”
When
the
coronavirus
vaccines
were
first
authorized
in
December
,
scientists
knew
little
about
how
well
they
might
work
in
pregnant
women
,
who
had
been
excluded
from
the
clinical
trials.Since
then
,
scientists
have
accumulated
a
small
but
steadily
growing
body
of
evidence
that
the
vaccines
are
safe
and
effective
during
pregnancy
.
Preliminary
results
from
two
continuing
studies
provide
additional
encouraging
news.The
Pfizer-BioNTech
and
Moderna
vaccines
produce
robust
immune
responses
in
pregnant
and
lactating
women
,
and
are
likely
to
provide
at
least
some
protection
against
two
dangerous
coronavirus
variants
,
according
to
a
study
published
in
JAMA
on
Thursday
.
Vaccinated
women
can
also
pass
protective
antibodies
to
their
fetuses
through
the
bloodstream
and
to
their
infants
through
breast
milk
,
the
research
suggests.In
a
second
study
,
published
in
the
journal
Obstetrics
&
Gynecology
on
Tuesday
,
researchers
found
no
evidence
that
either
the
Pfizer
or
Moderna
vaccines
damaged
the
placenta
during
pregnancy.
“
We
can
shift
our
framework
from
,
‘
Let
’
s
protect
pregnant
people
from
the
vaccine
,
’
to
‘
Let
’
s
protect
pregnant
people
and
their
infants
through
the
vaccine
,
’
”
said
Dr.
Emily
S.
Miller
,
an
expert
in
maternal-fetal
medicine
at
Northwestern
University
and
co-author
of
the
placenta
study
.
“
I
think
that
’
s
really
powerful.
”
Covid
presents
serious
risks
during
pregnancy
.
Research
has
shown
,
for
instance
,
that
pregnant
women
with
coronavirus
symptoms
are
more
likely
to
be
admitted
to
the
intensive
care
unit
,
require
mechanical
ventilation
and
to
die
from
the
virus
than
are
symptomatic
women
of
a
similar
age
who
are
not
pregnant.Because
of
these
risks
,
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
has
recommended
that
the
vaccines
at
least
be
made
available
to
pregnant
people
,
many
of
whom
have
opted
to
receive
the
shots.In
the
JAMA
study
,
scientists
at
the
Beth
Israel
Deaconess
Medical
Center
in
Boston
and
Harvard
Medical
School
studied
blood
samples
from
103
women
who
had
received
the
Pfizer
or
Moderna
vaccine
between
December
2020
and
March
2021
.
Of
these
women
,
30
had
received
the
vaccine
while
pregnant
,
16
while
lactating
and
57
while
neither
pregnant
nor
lactating.The
researchers
analyzed
the
blood
samples
for
signs
that
the
shots
had
conferred
some
protection
against
the
coronavirus
.
Immune
responses
are
complex
,
and
may
involve
both
antibodies
—
proteins
that
can
bind
to
and
block
the
virus
—
and
T
cells
,
which
help
the
body
recognize
the
virus
and
destroy
infected
cells.The
vaccines
produced
similar
responses
in
all
three
groups
of
women
,
eliciting
both
antibody
and
T-cell
responses
against
the
coronavirus
,
the
scientists
found
.
Of
particular
note
,
experts
said
,
was
the
fact
that
the
shots
produced
high
levels
of
neutralizing
antibodies
,
which
can
prevent
the
virus
from
entering
cells
,
in
both
pregnant
and
nonpregnant
women.
“
Clearly
,
the
vaccines
were
working
in
these
people
,
”
said
Akiko
Iwasaki
,
an
immunologist
at
Yale
University
who
was
not
involved
in
the
research
.
“
These
levels
are
expected
to
be
quite
protective.
”
The
researchers
also
found
neutralizing
antibodies
in
the
breast
milk
of
vaccinated
mothers
and
in
umbilical
cord
blood
collected
from
infants
at
delivery
.
“
Vaccination
of
pregnant
people
and
lactating
people
actually
leads
to
transfer
of
some
immunity
to
their
newborns
and
lactating
infants
,
”
said
Dr.
Ai-ris
Y.
Collier
,
a
physician-scientist
at
Beth
Israel
who
is
the
first
author
of
the
paper.The
results
are
“
really
encouraging
,
”
Dr.
Iwasaki
said
.
“
There
is
this
added
benefit
of
conferring
protective
antibodies
to
the
newborn
and
the
fetus
,
which
is
all
the
more
reason
to
get
vaccinated.
”
The
scientists
also
measured
the
women
’
s
immune
responses
to
two
variants
of
concern
:
B.1.1.7
,
which
was
first
identified
in
Britain
,
and
B.1.351
,
which
was
first
identified
in
South
Africa
.
All
three
groups
of
women
produced
antibody
and
T-cell
responses
to
both
variants
after
vaccination
,
although
their
antibody
responses
were
weaker
against
the
variants
,
especially
B.1.351
,
than
against
the
original
strain
of
the
virus
,
according
to
the
study.
“
These
women
developed
immune
responses
to
the
variants
,
although
the
asterisk
is
that
the
antibody
responses
were
reduced
several-fold
,
”
said
Dr.
Dan
Barouch
,
a
study
author
and
virologist
at
Beth
Israel
.
(
Dr.
Barouch
and
his
colleagues
developed
the
Johnson
&
Johnson
vaccine
,
which
was
not
included
in
this
study
.
)
“
Overall
,
it
’
s
good
news
,
”
he
added
.
“
And
it
increases
the
data
that
suggests
that
there
is
a
substantial
benefit
for
pregnant
women
to
be
vaccinated.
”
The
researchers
also
found
that
14
percent
of
pregnant
women
reported
a
fever
after
their
second
vaccine
dose
,
compared
to
52
percent
of
nonpregnant
women
.
They
did
not
observe
any
severe
complications
or
side
effects.The
study
will
continue
,
with
researchers
monitoring
women
’
s
longer-term
immune
responses
.
And
larger
epidemiological
studies
are
still
needed
to
confirm
these
lab-based
results
,
Dr.
Collier
noted.In
the
second
study
,
a
research
team
from
Northwestern
University
and
the
Ann
and
Robert
H.
Lurie
Children
’
s
Hospital
of
Chicago
examined
the
placentas
from
200
women
who
gave
birth
between
April
2020
and
April
2021
.
Eighty-four
of
the
women
had
received
either
the
Pfizer
or
Moderna
vaccine
during
pregnancy
;
the
remainder
had
not
received
any
coronavirus
vaccine.The
placentas
from
vaccinated
women
were
not
any
more
likely
to
show
signs
of
injury
or
abnormality
than
those
from
unvaccinated
women
,
the
researchers
found.
“
These
data
build
upon
the
emerging
data
that
’
s
come
out
about
these
vaccines
and
their
safety
in
pregnant
people
,
”
Dr.
Miller
said
.
“
These
are
translational
data
that
suggests
the
placenta
doesn
’
t
see
any
injurious
impact
of
the
vaccine
.
And
that
’
s
really
fantastic.
”
The
findings
have
limitations
,
she
acknowledged
.
Because
the
vaccines
were
only
authorized
recently
,
most
of
the
women
in
the
study
were
vaccinated
in
the
third
trimester
of
pregnancy
,
and
many
of
them
were
health
care
workers
,
who
were
among
the
first
people
eligible
for
the
shots.Dr
.
Miller
and
her
colleagues
are
continuing
to
collect
more
data
,
including
from
patients
who
were
vaccinated
earlier
in
their
pregnancies
and
who
received
the
one-shot
Johnson
&
Johnson
vaccine.
“
This
is
ongoing
work
,
”
Dr.
Miller
said
.
But
they
wanted
to
publish
their
preliminary
data
as
soon
as
they
had
it
,
she
added
,
“
to
help
people
make
the
best
decision
they
can.
”
On
Dec.
29
,
a
National
Guardsman
in
Colorado
became
the
first
known
case
in
the
United
States
of
a
contagious
new
variant
of
the
coronavirus.The
news
was
unsettling
.
The
variant
,
called
B.1.1.7
,
had
roiled
Britain
,
was
beginning
to
surge
in
Europe
and
threatened
to
do
the
same
in
the
United
States
.
And
although
scientists
didn
’
t
know
it
yet
,
other
mutants
were
also
cropping
up
around
the
country
.
They
included
variants
that
had
devastated
South
Africa
and
Brazil
and
that
seemed
to
be
able
to
sidestep
the
immune
system
,
as
well
as
others
homegrown
in
California
,
Oregon
and
New
York.This
mélange
of
variants
could
not
have
come
at
a
worse
time
.
The
nation
was
at
the
start
of
a
post-holiday
surge
of
cases
that
would
dwarf
all
previous
waves
.
And
the
distribution
of
powerful
vaccines
made
by
Moderna
and
Pfizer-BioNTech
was
botched
by
chaos
and
miscommunication
.
Scientists
warned
that
the
variants
—
and
B.1.1.7
in
particular
—
might
lead
to
a
fourth
wave
,
and
that
the
already
strained
health
care
system
might
buckle.That
didn
’
t
happen
.
B.1.1.7
did
become
the
predominant
version
of
the
virus
in
the
United
States
,
now
accounting
for
nearly
three-quarters
of
all
cases
.
But
the
surge
experts
had
feared
ended
up
a
mere
blip
in
most
of
the
country
.
The
nationwide
total
of
daily
new
cases
began
falling
in
April
and
has
now
dropped
more
than
85
percent
from
the
horrific
highs
of
January.
“
It
’
s
pretty
humbling
,
”
said
Kristian
Andersen
,
a
virologist
at
Scripps
Research
in
La
Jolla
,
Calif.
“
We
could
actually
do
a
lot
better
than
I
had
expected.
”
Dr
.
Andersen
and
other
virus
watchers
still
see
variants
as
a
potential
source
of
trouble
in
the
months
to
come
—
particularly
one
that
has
battered
Brazil
and
is
growing
rapidly
in
17
U.S.
states
.
But
they
are
also
taking
stock
of
the
past
few
months
to
better
understand
how
the
nation
dodged
the
variant
threat.Experts
point
to
a
combination
of
factors
—
masks
,
social
distancing
and
other
restrictions
,
and
perhaps
a
seasonal
wane
of
infections
—
that
bought
crucial
time
for
tens
of
millions
of
Americans
to
get
vaccinated
.
They
also
credit
a
good
dose
of
serendipity
,
as
B.1.1.7
,
unlike
some
of
its
competitors
,
is
powerless
against
the
vaccines.
“
I
think
we
got
lucky
,
to
be
honest
,
”
said
Nathan
Grubaugh
,
an
epidemiologist
at
Yale
University
.
“
We
’
re
being
rescued
by
the
vaccine.
”
After
B.1.1.7
emerged
at
the
end
of
December
,
new
variants
with
combinations
of
troubling
mutations
came
to
light
.
Scientists
fretted
about
how
the
competition
between
the
variants
might
play
out.In
January
,
researchers
in
California
discovered
a
variant
with
10
mutations
that
was
growing
more
common
there
and
had
drifted
into
other
states
.
Laboratory
experiments
suggested
that
the
variant
could
dodge
an
antibody
treatment
that
had
worked
well
against
previous
forms
of
the
virus
,
and
that
it
was
perhaps
also
more
contagious.In
the
months
that
have
followed
,
the
United
States
has
drastically
improved
its
surveillance
of
how
the
variants
mutate
.
Last
week
more
than
28,800
virus
genomes
,
almost
10
percent
of
all
positive
test
cases
,
were
uploaded
to
an
international
online
database
called
GISAID
.
That
clearer
picture
has
enabled
scientists
to
watch
how
the
mutants
compete.The
California
variant
turned
out
to
be
a
weak
competitor
,
and
its
numbers
dropped
sharply
in
February
and
March
.
It
is
still
prevalent
in
parts
of
Northern
California
,
but
it
has
virtually
disappeared
from
southern
parts
of
the
state
and
never
found
a
foothold
elsewhere
in
the
country
.
By
April
24
,
it
accounted
for
just
3.2
percent
of
all
virus
samples
tested
in
the
country
,
as
B.1.1.7
soared
to
66
percent.
“
B.1.1.7
went
in
for
the
knockout
,
and
it
’
s
like
,
‘
Bye
bye
,
California
variant
,
’
”
Dr.
Andersen
said.On
the
other
side
of
the
country
,
researchers
reported
in
February
that
a
variant
called
B.1.526
was
spreading
quickly
in
New
York
and
appeared
to
be
a
formidable
adversary
for
B.1.1.7
.
By
February
,
each
of
those
variants
had
grown
to
about
35
percent
of
the
samples
collected
by
Dr.
Grubaugh
’
s
lab
in
Connecticut
.
But
B.1.1.7
came
out
on
top.In
fact
,
B.1.1.7
seems
to
have
the
edge
over
nearly
every
variant
identified
so
far
.
At
a
congressional
hearing
on
Tuesday
,
Dr.
Rochelle
P.
Walensky
,
the
director
of
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
,
said
B.1.1.7
made
up
72
percent
of
cases
in
the
country.
“
We
’
re
really
seeing
B.1.1.7
pushing
out
other
variants
decisively
,
”
said
Emma
Hodcroft
,
an
epidemiologist
at
the
University
of
Bern.The
variants
identified
in
California
and
New
York
turned
out
to
be
only
moderately
more
contagious
than
older
versions
of
the
virus
,
and
much
of
their
initial
success
may
have
been
luck
.
The
overall
boom
in
cases
last
fall
amplified
what
might
otherwise
have
gone
undetected.It
’
s
unclear
what
gives
B.1.1.7
an
edge
over
the
others
.
“
Is
it
the
greatest
of
all
the
variants
?
It
’
s
just
really
hard
to
say
right
now
,
”
said
Angela
Rasmussen
,
a
virologist
at
the
University
of
Saskatchewan
’
s
Vaccine
and
Infectious
Disease
Organization
.
“
We
need
more
research
to
figure
out
more
about
what
all
of
these
combinations
of
mutations
are
doing.
”
Some
answers
may
come
from
California
,
where
researchers
are
staging
a
head-to-head
competition
in
a
lab
,
injecting
mice
with
a
cocktail
of
B.1.1.7
and
six
other
variants.
“
The
idea
is
to
see
which
one
will
win
out
,
”
said
Dr.
Charles
Chiu
,
a
virologist
at
the
University
of
California
,
San
Francisco
,
who
was
the
first
scientist
to
discover
the
California
variant.In
Michigan
,
one
of
the
few
states
that
saw
the
predicted
surge
in
cases
this
spring
,
B.1.1.7
found
a
hook
in
younger
people
who
were
returning
to
schools
and
playing
contact
sports.
“
Because
it
’
s
more
transmissible
,
the
virus
finds
cracks
in
behavior
that
normally
wouldn
’
t
have
been
as
much
of
a
problem
,
”
said
Emily
Martin
,
an
epidemiologist
at
the
University
of
Michigan.But
in
the
rest
of
the
country
,
people
naturally
became
more
cautious
when
confronted
with
the
horrifying
toll
of
the
virus
after
the
holidays
.
B.1.1.7
is
thought
to
be
about
60
percent
more
contagious
than
previous
forms
of
the
virus
,
but
its
mode
of
spread
is
no
different
.
Most
states
had
at
least
partial
restrictions
on
indoor
dining
and
instituted
mask
mandates.
“
B.1.1.7
is
more
transmissible
,
but
it
can
’
t
jump
through
a
mask
,
”
Dr.
Hodcroft
said
.
“
So
we
can
still
stop
its
spread.
”
But
other
experts
are
still
discomfited
by
how
much
the
virus
seems
to
have
defied
predictions.
“
I
can
’
t
necessarily
ascribe
it
just
to
behavior
,
”
said
Sarah
Cobey
,
an
evolutionary
biologist
at
the
University
of
Chicago
.
Respiratory
viruses
sometimes
go
through
seasonal
cycles
,
but
it
’
s
not
clear
why
the
coronavirus
’
s
cycle
would
have
caused
it
to
decline
in
the
middle
of
winter
.
“
That
makes
me
feel
maybe
even
more
ignorant
,
”
she
said.Also
puzzling
is
why
variants
that
pummeled
other
countries
have
not
yet
spread
widely
in
the
United
States
.
B.1.351
rapidly
dominated
South
Africa
and
some
other
African
countries
late
last
year
.
It
was
first
reported
in
the
United
States
on
Jan.
28
,
but
still
accounts
for
only
1
percent
of
cases
.
That
may
be
because
it
can
’
t
get
ahead
of
the
fast-spreading
B.1.1.7.
“
I
think
that
is
because
it
doesn
’
t
really
have
much
transmission
advantage
,
”
said
William
Hanage
,
an
epidemiologist
at
the
Harvard
T.H
.
Chan
School
of
Public
Health.P.1
,
a
variant
that
is
ravaging
Brazil
,
got
off
to
a
slow
start
in
the
United
States
but
is
now
estimated
to
make
up
more
than
10
percent
of
the
country
’
s
cases.
“
I
believe
it
is
a
matter
of
time
before
the
P.1
variant
becomes
one
of
the
most
prevalent
in
the
U.S.A.
,
”
warned
Dr.
André
Ricardo
Ribas
Freitas
,
a
medical
epidemiologist
at
Faculdade
São
Leopoldo
Mandic
in
Brazil.Still
,
Nels
Elde
,
an
evolutionary
biologist
at
the
University
of
Utah
,
said
the
events
of
the
past
four
months
raised
questions
about
whether
it
was
worth
fretting
over
different
variants
,
rather
than
focusing
on
the
behaviors
that
can
rein
in
all
of
them.
“
We
’
re
splitting
hairs
between
a
handful
of
mutations
here
and
there
,
we
’
ve
lost
some
perspective
,
”
he
said
.
“
It
’
s
catnip
for
a
curious
mind.
”
The
United
States
also
has
an
ample
supply
of
powerful
vaccines
that
make
variants
more
an
academic
concern
than
a
cause
of
worry
for
the
average
person
.
The
vaccines
may
be
slightly
less
effective
against
the
variants
identified
in
South
Africa
and
Brazil
,
but
they
prevent
severe
disease
from
all
known
variants.It
’
s
not
impossible
the
situation
could
worsen
.
Only
about
35
percent
of
people
in
the
United
States
have
been
fully
immunized
,
and
the
protection
from
the
vaccines
may
wane
by
the
winter
.
No
one
knows
how
variants
emerging
in
other
parts
of
the
world
,
like
one
that
has
come
to
prominence
in
India
and
is
circulating
at
low
levels
in
the
United
States
,
will
behave
here
.
And
yet
more
variants
will
inevitably
arise
in
places
where
the
virus
is
rampant
,
Dr.
Cobey
warned
:
“
There
’
s
a
lot
of
evolution
to
happen
yet.
”
In
January
,
a
man
in
his
60s
with
heart
disease
and
diabetes
went
to
a
South
Dakota
hospital
with
a
cough
and
fever
,
worried
he
had
Covid
.
A
nurse
swabbed
the
inside
of
his
nose
,
and
the
sample
went
into
a
small
device
resembling
an
inkjet-printer
cartridge
,
which
was
then
placed
into
a
machine
about
the
size
of
a
printer.This
so-called
quad
test
,
now
available
at
thousands
of
hospitals
and
clinics
around
the
country
,
could
detect
not
only
the
coronavirus
,
but
two
types
of
influenza
and
the
respiratory
syncytial
virus
,
or
R.S.V
.
A
little
more
than
a
half-hour
later
,
Dr.
Blake
Gustafson
had
the
patient
’
s
result
:
He
had
the
flu.
“
I
remember
giving
myself
a
fist
bump
like
,
‘
Yes
!
It
’
s
not
Covid
.
It
’
s
the
flu
,
’
”
said
Dr.
Gustafson
,
chief
of
emergency
medicine
of
the
Sanford
USD
Medical
Center
in
Sioux
Falls
,
S.D
.
He
relayed
the
news
to
the
patient
and
his
wife
,
happily
adding
that
there
was
a
treatment
he
could
offer
right
away
,
Tamiflu
.
“
The
relief
in
their
eyes
above
their
masks
was
very
satisfying
,
”
Dr.
Gustafson
said.The
patient
’
s
situation
was
somewhat
unusual
this
past
winter
given
that
the
United
States
,
like
many
other
countries
,
witnessed
a
shocking
absence
of
a
flu
season
.
But
as
the
country
begins
to
reopen
,
doctors
say
that
flu
and
other
pathogens
might
make
a
comeback
this
autumn
.
What
’
s
more
,
even
as
a
growing
number
of
people
get
vaccinated
against
Covid
,
there
are
still
some
40,000
new
infections
every
day
in
the
United
States
,
and
a
significant
number
of
people
who
may
be
resistant
to
taking
the
vaccines.The
Sanford
Health
system
,
which
includes
46
hospitals
and
1,400
physicians
in
South
Dakota
,
carries
out
600
to
800
tests
for
the
coronavirus
a
day
in
its
clinics
using
antigen
tests
,
which
detect
proteins
made
by
the
virus
.
But
according
to
Rochelle
Odenbrett
,
the
senior
executive
director
of
laboratories
,
the
organization
is
now
in
the
process
of
replacing
all
of
those
tests
with
the
quad
tests
used
in
its
emergency
settings.Unlike
the
antigen
tests
,
the
quad
test
looks
for
a
virus
’
s
genetic
material
using
a
polymerase
chain
reaction
,
or
P.C.R
.
for
short
.
The
P.C.R.-based
method
is
far
more
accurate
than
the
antigen
approach
,
Ms.
Odenbrett
says
.
She
notes
that
P.C.R
.
sequencing
of
patient
samples
used
to
be
more
cumbersome
and
relied
on
multistep
procedures
across
different
laboratory
rooms
.
“
It
’
s
just
amazing
how
the
technology
has
evolved
,
”
she
said.The
quad
test
used
by
the
Sanford
system
is
made
by
the
California-based
company
Cepheid
,
which
received
emergency
authorization
from
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
in
late
September.Although
last
year
’
s
flu
season
was
nonexistent
,
Dr.
Geoffrey
Baird
of
the
University
of
Washington
in
Seattle
said
that
a
confluence
of
factors
might
precipitate
its
return
in
the
fall
:
children
returning
to
school
buildings
,
declining
use
of
masks
and
perhaps
a
lack
of
recent
immune
system
exposure
to
the
flu
.
If
more
people
get
sick
in
the
fall
,
he
added
,
they
will
want
to
know
if
it
is
flu
or
the
coronavirus.
“
We
in
the
laboratory
are
preparing
for
another
big
boom
in
testing
,
”
said
Dr.
Baird
,
whose
team
has
run
more
than
two
million
coronavirus
tests
since
the
beginning
of
the
pandemic
.
“
Even
if
people
are
vaccinated
,
they
’
re
going
to
wonder
,
‘
Am
I
the
breakthrough
case
?
’
”
In
addition
to
Cepheid
,
other
companies
have
developed
tests
that
look
for
influenza
and
the
coronavirus
at
the
same
time
,
including
Roche
,
which
has
received
emergency
use
authorization
for
a
test
that
looks
for
the
coronavirus
,
influenza
A
and
influenza
B
at
once.In
recent
years
various
hospitals
have
developed
in-house
versions
of
these
combination
tests
as
well
,
some
of
which
look
for
more
than
a
dozen
different
respiratory
pathogens
simultaneously
using
P.C.R
.
technology
.
Those
“
multiplex
”
tests
are
especially
helpful
in
diagnosing
illnesses
in
people
with
weak
immune
systems
because
they
allow
doctors
to
swiftly
discern
what
pathogen
is
making
a
person
sick
before
it
is
too
late
to
start
the
right
treatments.A
French
company
,
bioMérieux
,
sells
a
P.C.R
.
test
that
looks
for
the
coronavirus
as
well
as
21
other
viruses
and
bacteria
simultaneously
.
And
Roche
recently
bought
a
company
that
sells
a
machine
that
can
screen
for
more
than
20
pathogens
in
one
go.Testing
for
multiple
pathogens
does
not
always
lead
to
a
simple
treatment
,
however
.
Co-infections
,
in
which
a
person
is
infected
with
multiple
viruses
simultaneously
,
are
more
common
than
doctors
expected
,
and
sometimes
the
multiplex
tests
might
detect
a
viral
infection
but
miss
a
bacterial
one
,
said
Dr.
Daniel
Griffin
,
chief
of
infectious
diseases
at
ProHealth
New
York
.
A
patient
could
carry
the
influenza
virus
but
also
test
positive
for
a
bacterium
such
as
pneumococcus
,
for
example.
“
We
initially
thought
that
every
time
we
identified
a
virus
,
we
would
just
be
able
stop
all
antibiotics
and
just
treat
the
virus
if
effective
antiviral
therapy
was
available
,
”
Dr.
Griffin
said
.
“
We
now
know
that
we
often
need
to
continue
antibiotics
,
”
he
explained
,
because
sometimes
the
multiplex
tests
are
not
sensitive
enough
to
rule
out
a
bacterial
culprit.Doctors
and
test
developers
are
still
grappling
with
how
many
pathogens
to
test
patients
for
in
different
settings
.
“
A
burning
question
at
every
company
is
what
panel
is
best
—
is
it
one
,
two
,
four
,
20
?
”
said
Dr.
Mark
Miller
,
chief
medical
officer
at
bioMérieux
.
Relatively
young
and
healthy
adults
might
just
need
a
quad
test
to
know
if
they
should
start
on
Tamiflu
for
influenza
,
for
example
,
but
patients
with
underlying
chronic
diseases
who
are
very
sick
might
benefit
from
receiving
the
test
for
22
different
pathogens
so
that
doctors
can
decide
whether
they
need
to
be
admitted
to
a
hospital.Before
the
pandemic
,
people
were
not
always
as
curious
to
know
the
exact
pathogen
causing
respiratory
symptoms
,
according
to
Dr.
Alexandra
Valsamakis
,
head
of
clinical
development
and
medical
affairs
at
Roche
Diagnostics
Solutions.
“
I
think
there
was
always
this
perception
of
‘
Oh
,
whatever
it
is
,
it
’
s
not
going
to
kill
us
,
’
”
Dr.
Valsamakis
said
.
But
the
terrible
toll
of
Covid-19
has
changed
that
.
“
There
’
s
this
need
to
actually
know
what
’
s
there
,
more
than
there
ever
was
before.
”
The
next
time
the
world
faces
an
outbreak
of
a
fast-spreading
and
deadly
new
pathogen
,
governments
must
act
swiftly
and
be
ready
to
restrict
travel
or
mandate
masks
even
before
anyone
knows
the
extent
of
the
threat
,
according
to
a
pair
of
new
reports
delivered
to
the
World
Health
Organization.The
studies
are
intended
to
address
missteps
over
the
past
year
that
led
to
more
than
3.25
million
deaths
,
some
$
10
trillion
in
economic
losses
and
more
than
100
million
people
pushed
into
extreme
poverty.
“
Current
institutions
,
public
and
private
,
failed
to
protect
people
from
a
devastating
pandemic
,
”
concluded
one
of
the
reports
,
released
on
Wednesday
,
which
called
the
Covid-19
pandemic
“
the
21st
century
’
s
Chernobyl
moment.
”
“
Without
change
,
”
it
said
,
these
institutions
“
will
not
prevent
a
future
one.
”
The
reviews
,
released
in
advance
of
this
month
’
s
meeting
of
the
W.H.O.
’
s
governing
assembly
,
were
written
by
appointees
who
donated
countless
hours
in
the
midst
of
their
own
countries
’
pandemic
fights
to
interview
hundreds
of
experts
,
comb
through
thousands
of
documents
,
gather
data
and
seek
counsel
from
public
and
private
institutions
around
the
world.Pandemics
,
the
authors
concluded
,
are
an
existential
threat
on
the
order
of
a
chemical
or
nuclear
weapon
,
and
preparing
for
them
must
be
the
responsibility
of
the
highest
levels
of
political
leadership
rather
than
only
health
departments
,
often
among
the
least
powerful
of
government
agencies.The
reviews
,
requested
last
year
by
the
194
country
representatives
governing
the
W.H.O.
,
also
called
for
nations
to
provide
predictable
and
sustainable
financing
to
the
W.H.O
.
and
to
their
national
preparedness
systems.
“
W.H.O
.
is
underpowered
and
underfunded
by
its
member
states
,
”
Helen
Clark
,
a
former
prime
minister
of
New
Zealand
and
an
author
of
one
of
the
reports
,
said
at
a
media
conference
this
week.Whether
the
recommendations
lead
to
lasting
change
is
an
open
question
.
Ms.
Clark
’
s
group
,
the
Independent
Panel
for
Pandemic
Preparedness
and
Response
,
pointedly
noted
that
since
the
H1N1
pandemic
in
2009
,
there
have
been
11
high-level
commissions
and
panels
that
produced
more
than
16
reports
,
with
the
vast
majority
of
recommendations
never
implemented.These
reports
“
sit
closed
gathering
dust
in
U.N.
basements
and
government
shelves
,
”
said
Ellen
Johnson
Sirleaf
,
another
author
of
that
report
,
who
served
as
president
of
Liberia
during
the
Ebola
outbreak
there
in
2014
and
2015.Under
the
current
international
health
regulations
,
“
there
’
s
no
enforcement
mechanism
,
”
said
Dr.
Lothar
H.
Wieler
,
president
of
the
Robert
Koch
Institute
in
Berlin
,
who
led
the
second
major
review
,
in
which
scientists
scrutinized
how
those
regulations
functioned
in
the
pandemic.Both
reports
supported
the
creation
of
an
international
pandemic
treaty
that
would
establish
consequences
if
countries
failed
to
live
up
to
their
commitments
.
Those
might
include
quickly
sharing
samples
and
sequences
of
emerging
pathogens
,
providing
rapid
access
to
teams
deployed
by
the
W.H.O
.
for
early
investigation
and
response
,
and
ensuring
equitable
distribution
of
vaccines
,
medicine
and
tests
around
the
world.Both
reviews
also
noted
that
early
in
the
coronavirus
pandemic
,
many
countries
all
but
ignored
the
formal
warning
issued
by
the
W.H.O.
,
known
as
a
Public
Health
Emergency
of
International
Concern
.
Its
unfortunate
acronym
,
Pheic
,
is
often
pronounced
“
fake
,
”
one
of
the
reports
noted
.
(
Whether
the
proposal
to
change
this
to
“
Phemic
”
will
prove
more
stirring
remains
to
be
seen
.
)
The
independent
panel
also
concluded
that
the
warning
could
have
been
declared
at
least
a
week
earlier
than
it
was
—
on
Jan.
22
,
2020
,
instead
of
Jan.
30.Even
then
,
“
so
many
countries
chose
to
wait
and
see
,
”
only
taking
concerted
action
once
intensive
care
beds
were
filled
,
Ms.
Clark
said.Her
group
contends
that
if
its
recommendations
on
political
leadership
,
financing
and
surveillance
systems
had
been
in
place
,
the
coronavirus
outbreak
would
not
have
become
a
pandemic
.
It
also
said
that
digital
tools
,
such
as
those
that
scrape
social
media
for
rumors
of
new
outbreaks
,
should
be
better
incorporated
into
official
responses.Notably
,
the
panel
did
not
delve
into
individual
countries
’
failures
in
its
report
,
determining
that
blame
would
not
be
“
a
very
useful
approach
,
”
said
Dr.
Anders
Nordström
,
who
helped
lead
the
effort.But
the
group
did
commission
a
study
of
28
countries
with
high
,
medium
and
low
Covid
death
rates
.
Some
of
the
countries
with
the
lowest
tolls
had
previously
invested
in
outbreak
control
systems
after
experiencing
SARS
,
MERS
and
Ebola
,
the
report
said
.
Successful
countries
acted
quickly
,
coordinated
across
multiple
government
agencies
,
meticulously
isolated
people
with
the
virus
and
quarantined
those
exposed
to
it.The
worst
performing
countries
had
underfunded
,
fragmented
health
systems
and
“
uncoordinated
approaches
that
devalued
science.
”
Those
with
the
highest
death
tolls
,
including
Brazil
and
the
United
States
,
denied
the
seriousness
of
the
pandemic
and
discouraged
action
,
the
panel
members
said
in
interviews.On
some
key
points
,
the
reports
came
to
different
conclusions
.
The
Independent
Panel
for
Pandemic
Preparedness
and
Response
argued
that
the
international
health
regulations
governing
how
countries
are
supposed
to
prepare
for
and
report
emerging
outbreaks
“
serve
to
constrain
rather
than
to
facilitate
rapid
action.
”
It
noted
that
some
countries
assessed
as
highly
prepared
under
the
framework
also
had
high
death
rates
early
in
the
pandemic.But
the
other
group
,
which
spent
months
reviewing
those
regulations
,
found
that
many
could
have
helped
but
were
“
simply
not
implemented
by
various
countries
,
”
Dr.
Wieler
said.Some
countries
were
not
even
aware
that
the
regulations
existed
,
his
group
reported
.
Others
lacked
laws
vital
to
responding
to
outbreaks
,
such
as
those
authorizing
quarantines.Changing
those
regulations
would
require
“
negotiations
for
years
,
”
Dr.
Wieler
said
,
noting
that
the
latest
set
took
a
decade
to
finalize
.
Instead
,
one
of
his
committee
’
s
major
recommendations
was
to
increase
countries
’
accountability
for
their
obligations
,
including
though
a
pandemic
treaty
and
a
periodic
review
of
their
preparedness
that
would
involve
other
countries.The
independent
panel
also
proposed
creating
an
international
council
led
by
heads
of
state
to
keep
attention
on
health
threats
and
to
oversee
a
multibillion-dollar
financing
program
that
governments
would
contribute
to
based
on
their
ability
.
It
would
promise
quick
payouts
to
countries
contending
with
a
new
outbreak
,
giving
them
an
incentive
to
report.
“
There
’
s
only
going
to
be
the
political
will
to
create
those
things
when
something
catastrophic
happens
,
”
said
Dr.
Mark
Dybul
,
one
of
the
panel
members
.
These
recommendations
stemmed
in
part
from
his
experience
leading
the
President
’
s
Emergency
Program
for
AIDS
Relief
,
known
as
Pepfar
,
and
the
Global
Fund
to
Fight
AIDS
,
Tuberculosis
and
Malaria
,
he
said.But
Dr.
Wieler
,
who
led
the
other
international
review
,
said
that
in
general
,
creating
new
institutions
rather
than
focusing
on
improving
existing
ones
could
increase
costs
,
complicate
coordination
and
damage
the
W.H.O.The
recommendations
of
panels
after
global
emergencies
have
sometimes
been
embraced
.
The
Ebola
outbreak
of
2014
and
2015
led
to
the
creation
of
the
W.H.O.
’
s
health
emergencies
program
,
aimed
at
boosting
the
agency
’
s
role
in
managing
health
crises
as
well
as
providing
technical
guidance
.
A
report
released
this
month
noted
that
the
new
program
had
received
“
increasingly
positive
feedback
”
from
countries
,
donors
and
partner
agencies
as
it
managed
dozens
of
health
and
humanitarian
emergencies.The
W.H.O
.
before
the
Ebola
outbreak
and
after
it
are
“
two
different
agencies
basically
,
”
said
Dr.
Joanne
Liu
,
a
former
international
president
of
Doctors
Without
Borders
and
a
member
of
the
independent
panel
.
Dr.
Liu
was
one
of
the
W.H.O.
’
s
most
trenchant
critics
during
the
Ebola
response
,
and
she
noted
a
“
marked
improvement
”
in
how
quickly
the
agency
had
declared
an
international
emergency
this
time.Dr
.
Liu
said
her
biggest
fear
was
that
as
wealthier
countries
gained
an
upper
hand
on
the
virus
because
of
vaccines
,
they
would
leave
low-
and
middle-income
countries
behind
,
with
Covid-19
becoming
“
a
neglected
pandemic
because
they
are
going
to
be
the
only
ones
fighting
it
—
a
bit
like
H.I.V
.
and
T.B.
”
To
avert
that
,
the
panel
released
a
slew
of
urgent
recommendations
and
called
for
the
world
’
s
entire
population
to
be
immunized
within
a
year.Wealthy
countries
with
a
good
vaccine
pipeline
should
commit
to
making
at
least
a
billion
doses
available
to
the
poorest
countries
by
September
through
programs
like
Covax
,
a
global
effort
to
provide
vaccines
equitably
throughout
the
world
,
the
group
said.On
May
4
,
Dr.
Hina
Talib
,
who
goes
by
the
handle
@
teenhealthdoc
on
Instagram
,
asked
the
parents
among
her
33,000
followers
if
they
were
hesitant
to
get
the
coronavirus
vaccine
for
their
12-
to
15-year-olds
,
and
if
so
,
why
.
Dr.
Talib
,
who
is
a
physician
in
the
adolescent
medicine
division
at
Children
’
s
Hospital
at
Montefiore
in
New
York
,
was
surprised
to
get
600
messages
filled
with
questions
and
concerns.More
often
than
not
,
Dr.
Talib
said
,
the
parents
had
already
had
the
Covid-19
vaccine
themselves
,
and
would
preface
their
message
with
:
“
I
’
m
not
an
anti-vaxxer
or
an
anti-masker
.
I
’
m
just
worried.
”
According
to
recently
released
polls
,
parents
across
the
country
share
those
concerns
,
with
only
about
30
percent
saying
they
would
get
their
children
vaccinated
right
away
.
Parents
of
infants
and
preschoolers
expressed
more
anxiety
about
the
vaccine
than
parents
of
teenagers
did.In
trials
,
there
have
been
no
serious
safety
concerns
for
children
thus
far
,
and
Dr.
Lee
Savio
Beers
,
the
president
of
the
American
Academy
of
Pediatrics
,
heralded
the
recent
emergency
use
approval
of
the
Pfizer-BioNTech
vaccine
for
children
12
to
15
as
“
a
critically
important
step
in
bringing
life-saving
vaccines
to
children
and
adolescents.
”
Despite
evidence
of
the
vaccine
’
s
safety
,
several
parents
I
spoke
to
over
the
past
week
were
similarly
hesitant
about
getting
their
children
the
shot
.
They
were
not
skeptical
about
all
vaccines
;
their
children
tended
to
be
up-to-date
with
recommended
well-child
vaccines
.
Their
overall
fear
was
related
to
the
newness
of
the
vaccine
,
and
unknown
future
outcomes.As
Kimberly
Johnson
,
38
,
the
mom
of
elementary-school-age
twins
in
Pound
Ridge
,
N.Y.
,
put
it
to
me
in
a
Facebook
message
:
“
I
’
m
not
anti-vax
but
this
all
seems
just
too
fast
for
me
.
I
don
’
t
want
my
children
to
be
responding
to
those
lawyer
ads
you
see
on
TV
25
years
from
now
.
You
know
the
ones
,
‘
If
you
were
under
the
age
of
16
in
the
years
2021-2022
and
received
the
Covid-19
vaccination
you
could
be
entitled
to
compensation
…
’
”
Parents
of
adolescents
I
spoke
to
tended
to
be
concerned
about
the
vaccine
affecting
puberty
and
future
fertility
for
their
children
.
Saadia
Faruqi
,
45
,
a
children
’
s
book
author
in
Houston
whose
kids
are
11
and
14
,
said
that
though
she
and
her
husband
got
the
vaccine
,
she
worries
about
how
it
might
affect
her
kids
’
hormones
,
fertility
and
their
growing
bodies.Ms
.
Faruqi
feels
that
if
she
makes
the
wrong
decision
for
her
children
,
“
I
’
m
going
to
be
a
bad
mom
,
”
she
said
.
“
I
don
’
t
want
either
of
my
kids
to
turn
around
when
they
’
re
in
adulthood
and
ask
,
‘
Why
did
you
do
this
?
’
”
Dr
.
Talib
has
also
heard
these
concerns
from
parents
of
teens
,
and
she
said
that
while
she
understands
the
worry
,
there
’
s
no
biological
mechanism
that
would
make
the
Covid-19
vaccine
worse
for
teenagers.
“
Hormones
related
to
puberty
should
not
change
the
immune
response
,
or
the
side
effect
profile
of
this
vaccine
,
”
Dr.
Talib
said
.
In
trials
,
the
Pfizer-BioNTech
Covid
vaccine
was
extremely
effective
for
children
12-15
—
there
were
zero
breakthrough
infections
among
the
kids
who
received
the
inoculation.Akiko
Iwasaki
,
a
professor
of
immunobiology
at
Yale
School
of
Medicine
,
who
wrote
an
article
for
The
Times
debunking
disinformation
about
the
Covid-19
vaccine
and
fertility
,
said
:
“
Even
during
the
vaccine
trials
some
of
the
women
inadvertently
got
pregnant
.
There
’
s
nothing
even
to
empirically
support
”
a
link
between
infertility
and
the
Covid
vaccine
.
“
I
have
two
daughters
myself
,
who
are
in
the
12-14
year
age
group
,
I
totally
understand
the
fear
,
”
she
said
.
“
But
there
’
s
really
no
basis
for
it.
”
Molly
Herman
,
35
,
who
has
a
2-year-old
and
is
32
weeks
pregnant
with
her
second
child
,
said
she
’
s
anxious
about
giving
her
daughter
the
vaccine
,
even
though
she
chose
to
get
the
shot
during
her
pregnancy
.
Her
daughter
has
never
had
antibiotics
and
she
’
s
barely
been
sick
,
so
“
I
don
’
t
know
what
she
’
s
allergic
to
,
”
said
Ms.
Herman
,
who
lives
in
Medfield
,
Mass.
,
and
works
in
higher
education.Nicole
Frehsee
Mazur
,
39
,
who
lives
in
Birmingham
,
Mich.
,
was
also
concerned
about
her
children
,
who
are
4
and
6
,
having
an
allergic
reaction
to
the
vaccine
,
because
she
had
an
averse
response
to
the
Moderna
shot
and
the
kids
have
allergies
.
“
I
’
m
not
opposed
to
vaccinating
them
,
I
would
just
like
to
wait
until
more
kids
are
vaccinated
,
”
she
said.Vaccines
may
be
available
for
children
over
2
by
September
at
the
earliest
,
so
these
concerns
are
theoretical
at
the
moment
.
Dr.
Nia
Heard-Garris
,
a
pediatrician
and
a
researcher
at
Feinberg
School
of
Medicine
at
Northwestern
University
,
said
that
she
understands
parents
’
hesitations
.
“
That
kind
of
conversation
has
been
present
before
we
had
a
feasible
vaccine
,
especially
from
groups
that
have
been
marginalized
and
experimented
on
.
It
’
s
not
a
fear
that
’
s
far-fetched
,
”
she
said.But
Dr.
Heard-Garris
said
she
trusts
the
science
and
the
data
,
and
that
the
abstract
fears
of
the
vaccine
’
s
long-term
effects
should
be
weighed
against
the
real-life
impacts
of
the
virus
.
As
the
A.A.P
.
President
Dr
.
Beers
put
it
:
“
While
fewer
children
than
adults
have
suffered
the
most
severe
disease
,
this
is
not
a
benign
disease
in
children
.
Thousands
of
children
have
been
hospitalized
,
and
hundreds
have
died.
”
The
doctors
I
spoke
to
were
hopeful
that
,
as
the
vaccine
becomes
a
reality
for
young
kids
rather
than
an
idea
,
parents
will
become
less
hesitant
.
They
urged
parents
,
especially
those
whose
kids
have
allergies
,
to
talk
to
their
pediatricians
about
the
best
approach
for
their
children
.
Dr.
Talib
said
that
parents
and
teens
alike
in
her
practice
have
said
they
would
feel
more
comfortable
getting
their
vaccines
in
a
pediatrician
’
s
office
,
closely
monitored
by
a
doctor
they
know
,
than
at
a
large
vaccine
site
like
a
convention
center
or
a
pharmacy
,
the
way
many
adults
have
been
vaccinated
.
Last
week
,
President
Biden
said
that
he
was
shifting
his
administration
’
s
vaccination
strategy
away
from
mass
vaccination
sites
and
toward
more
local
sites
in
order
to
get
more
shots
to
younger
people
and
the
vaccine
hesitant.It
’
s
still
unclear
how
many
states
or
localities
may
encourage
or
require
middle-
or
high-school
students
to
get
the
vaccine
before
attending
in-person
school
this
fall
,
though
more
than
100
colleges
and
universities
have
already
announced
that
students
must
have
the
Covid
vaccine
if
they
want
to
return
to
campus.Ultimately
,
the
biggest
proponents
of
the
vaccine
may
be
the
children
themselves
,
if
they
’
re
old
enough
to
have
an
opinion
.
“
Don
’
t
forget
to
check
in
with
your
teen
and
hear
their
thoughts
and
questions
about
the
vaccine
as
well
,
”
Dr.
Talib
said.Though
in
many
states
,
those
under
18
need
parental
consent
to
get
the
vaccine
,
Dr.
Heard-Garris
said
that
her
patients
in
the
16
and
up
crowd
who
are
already
eligible
for
the
vaccine
are
telling
her
,
“
I
want
this
;
I
know
my
mom
doesn
’
t
want
this.
”
They
want
to
be
able
to
get
back
to
school
,
and
go
to
prom
and
hang
out
with
their
friends
,
without
worrying
about
the
virus
looming
.
They
want
to
return
to
some
semblance
of
“
normal
,
”
just
like
their
parents.Holly
Elgison
and
Len
Schillaci
are
a
mixed
vaxxed
couple
,
and
they
are
far
from
alone.
“
I
was
always
going
to
get
the
vaccine
,
100
percent
,
”
said
Ms.
Elgison
,
a
medical
claims
auditor
in
Valrico
,
Fla.Her
husband
,
a
disaster
insurance
adjuster
,
said
he
will
pass
.
“
To
be
honest
with
you
,
I
think
that
the
worst
of
Covid
is
behind
us
,
”
Mr.
Schillaci
said
.
“
I
’
m
good.
”
As
the
Biden
administration
seeks
to
get
80
percent
of
adult
Americans
immunized
by
summer
,
the
continuing
reluctance
of
men
to
get
a
shot
could
impede
that
goal.Women
are
getting
vaccinated
at
a
far
higher
rate
—
about
10
percentage
points
—
than
men
,
even
though
the
male-female
divide
is
roughly
even
in
the
nation
’
s
overall
population
.
The
trend
is
worrisome
to
many
,
especially
as
vaccination
rates
have
dipped
a
bit
recently.The
reasons
for
the
U.S.
gender
gap
are
many
,
reflecting
the
role
of
women
in
specific
occupations
that
received
early
vaccine
priority
,
political
and
cultural
differences
and
long
standing
patterns
of
women
embracing
preventive
care
more
often
generally
than
men.The
gap
exists
even
as
Covid-19
deaths
worldwide
have
been
about
2.4
times
higher
for
men
than
among
women
.
And
the
division
elucidates
the
reality
of
women
’
s
disproportionate
role
in
caring
for
others
in
American
society.
“
It
could
matter
to
localized
herd
immunity
,
”
said
Alison
Buttenheim
,
an
associate
professor
of
nursing
at
the
University
of
Pennsylvania
and
expert
on
vaccine
hesitancy
.
“
While
most
experts
are
fretting
about
larger
gaps
by
race
,
political
party
,
religion
and
occupational
group
,
”
she
said
,
many
of
which
overlap
with
the
gender
disparities
,
“
I
haven
’
t
heard
of
any
specific
initiatives
to
target
men.
”
In
Los
Angeles
County
,
where
44
percent
of
women
over
16
have
gotten
their
first
shot
—
compared
with
30
percent
of
men
—
officials
are
scrambling
to
figure
out
how
to
do
just
that.
“
We
are
very
concerned
about
it
and
are
planning
to
embark
on
some
targeted
outreach
among
men
,
”
said
Dr.
Paul
Simon
,
the
chief
science
officer
at
the
Los
Angeles
County
Department
of
Public
Health
,
who
said
that
the
disparities
are
of
particular
concern
for
Black
and
Latino
men
.
Only
19
percent
of
Black
males
in
Los
Angeles
County
and
17
percent
of
Latino
males
have
received
at
least
one
dose
of
the
vaccine
,
compared
with
35
percent
of
Asian
men
and
32
percent
of
white
men
,
according
to
the
most
recent
data
available
from
early
this
month.
“
We
don
’
t
fully
understand
it
,
”
Dr.
Simon
said
.
“
One
of
our
messaging
strategies
will
be
that
the
vaccine
is
not
only
important
for
you
but
,
in
addition
,
is
a
means
of
protecting
others
in
your
family.
”
The
early
divisions
in
vaccine
rates
by
gender
could
largely
be
explained
by
demographics
.
Americans
over
70
got
the
first
sets
of
doses
,
and
women
make
up
a
larger
proportion
of
that
age
group
.
In
many
states
,
health
care
workers
and
schoolteachers
were
also
given
vaccine
priority
:
Women
account
for
three-quarters
of
full-time
health
care
workers
and
over
75
percent
of
public
schoolteachers
in
the
United
States
are
female.The
disparities
show
both
where
women
do
the
paid
and
unpaid
labor
of
life
.
For
instance
,
women
lost
the
majority
of
the
earliest
jobs
in
food
services
,
retail
businesses
,
health
care
and
government
jobs
.
The
mothers
among
them
have
done
most
of
the
work
in
the
shift
to
remote
schooling
and
caring
for
parents
and
sick
relatives.The
combination
may
have
increased
their
vaccine
motivation
in
two
ways
:
They
are
seeking
to
protect
the
rest
of
their
family
and
they
are
desperate
to
get
back
in
the
work
force
.
Indeed
,
just
as
women
drove
the
job
losses
last
year
,
they
are
leading
the
economic
recovery
now
;
roughly
half
a
million
women
joined
the
labor
force
in
March
,
in
part
because
in-person
schooling
has
resumed
across
much
of
the
country.
“
In
addition
to
women
being
disproportionately
represented
in
several
essential
jobs
,
”
said
Pilar
Gonalons-Pons
,
an
assistant
professor
of
sociology
at
the
University
of
Pennsylvania
who
specializes
in
gender
issues
,
“
they
are
also
disproportionately
represented
as
unpaid
caregivers
for
older
adults
in
their
families
and
communities
,
and
this
can
also
be
an
additional
motivation
for
getting
the
vaccine.
”
In
many
ways
,
the
pattern
with
vaccines
reflects
longstanding
gender
differences
when
it
comes
to
preventive
health
care
.
Women
are
on
average
more
likely
to
get
annual
physicals
than
men
,
even
when
adjusted
for
pre-existing
health
conditions
and
other
factors
,
and
are
more
likely
than
men
to
get
preventive
care.Men
are
more
likely
than
women
to
engage
in
behaviors
that
hurt
their
health
—
like
heavy
drinking
,
smoking
and
illicit
drug
use
—
and
are
more
overweight
compared
to
women
.
Men
are
less
likely
to
visit
doctors
regularly
and
go
to
the
emergency
room
in
a
crisis
and
to
get
basic
dental
care
,
according
to
federal
data
.
Vaccines
are
no
exception
:
Historically
,
influenza
vaccination
is
much
higher
among
females
—
about
63
percent
compared
to
53
percent
—
though
the
gap
narrows
in
Americans
over
75
years
old.The
coronavirus
vaccine
“
is
the
latest
expression
of
the
tried-and-true
gender
gap
we
’
ve
long
witnessed
in
preventive
health
care
seeking
patterns
,
”
said
Lindsey
Leininger
,
a
health
policy
researcher
and
clinical
professor
at
Tuck
School
of
Business
at
Dartmouth
College.But
experts
say
that
even
in
the
context
of
general
male
health
care
recalcitrance
,
there
may
be
some
factors
that
are
specific
to
this
vaccine
that
are
preventing
more
male
shots
in
arms
.
Because
the
sign
up
has
been
cumbersome
and
confusing
,
men
may
have
had
less
patience
in
navigating
the
system
,
which
has
largely
taken
place
online
,
a
process
that
women
might
find
easier
since
they
tend
to
get
more
of
their
health
care
information
online.
“
We
have
to
figure
out
if
disparities
are
about
access
,
if
men
are
having
more
difficulty
navigating
the
appointment
systems
,
”
Mr.
Simon
of
Los
Angeles
said.Further
,
when
it
comes
to
the
coronavirus
—
which
has
been
the
subject
of
rampant
misinformation
,
evolving
medical
advice
and
politicization
—
other
dynamics
may
be
at
work.
“
Some
men
have
a
sense
that
they
are
not
necessarily
susceptible
,
”
Mr.
Simon
said
health
care
workers
have
told
officials
.
“
They
have
weathered
this
for
more
than
a
year
and
have
a
sense
of
omnipotence.
”
Public
health
and
academic
experts
have
been
long
concerned
with
the
“
macho
”
effect
that
prevents
men
from
getting
all
sorts
of
health
care
,
and
fear
that
it
might
be
exacerbated
with
this
vaccine
.
(
Notably
,
in
the
most
male
service
branch
of
the
military
,
the
Marines
,
about
40
percent
of
those
who
were
offered
the
vaccine
by
the
Defense
Department
have
turned
it
down
.
)
“
This
avoidance
has
been
linked
to
masculinity
ideals
of
men
being
strong
,
invincible
and
not
asking
for
help
,
”
said
Kristen
W.
Springer
,
an
associate
professor
in
the
Department
of
Sociology
at
Rutgers
University
in
New
Jersey
who
has
done
research
on
this
trait.
“
In
other
words
,
these
cultural
ideals
lead
men
to
avoid
important
health
care
in
order
to
act
masculine
,
”
she
said
.
“
Now
that
the
vaccine
is
available
to
everyone
,
it
will
be
interesting
to
watch
male-female
differences
in
vaccine
uptake
,
because
these
will
more
likely
reflect
social
and
cultural
ideas
about
gender
and
health
,
such
as
the
cultural
idea
that
‘
real
men
’
don
’
t
need
preventive
health
care.
”
At
this
stage
,
U.S.
health
authorities
have
not
released
data
on
nonbinary
adults
and
vaccination.There
may
also
be
political
connections
.
Women
are
far
more
likely
than
men
to
register
as
Democrats
,
and
polls
demonstrate
that
Republicans
across
the
country
have
been
far
less
likely
than
Democrats
to
embrace
the
vaccine.So
who
will
men
listen
to
?
Not
their
wives
and
female
friends
or
doctors
,
it
seems
.
For
their
recent
preprint
study
,
Leah
Witus
and
Erik
Larson
,
professors
at
Macalester
College
in
Saint
Paul
,
Minn.
,
watched
videos
with
men
and
women
that
featured
identical
information
about
the
vaccine
.
Among
the
1,184
Americans
who
watched
them
,
most
were
positively
influenced
by
the
male
narrator
while
the
female
narrator
got
a
far
more
mixed
response.
“
The
male-narrated
version
of
the
video
increased
vaccination
intention
in
viewers
,
”
said
Ms.
Witus
,
“
but
the
female-narrated
had
mixed
associations
with
vaccine
propensity
,
and
in
some
viewers
,
those
that
identified
as
conservative
,
actually
decreased
vaccination
intention.
”
This
may
spell
victory
for
Mr.
Schillaci
as
he
and
his
wife
subtly
joust
for
influence
over
their
20-year-old
son
’
s
vaccination
decision
.
Mr.
Schillaci
has
been
sharing
his
views
with
his
son
,
whom
his
wife
is
prodding
to
take
a
shot.
“
I
would
rather
he
got
the
shot
,
and
I
hope
that
he
’
ll
consider
it
,
”
said
Ms.
Elgison.But
Ms.
Elgison
’
s
own
decision
may
benefit
her
son
,
even
if
he
decides
against
the
vaccine.As
often
happens
in
life
,
men
may
find
their
gaps
covered
by
women
.
“
To
the
extent
most
people
live
and
socialize
in
a
mixed-gender
setting
,
the
men
will
benefit
from
the
higher
coverage
among
women
,
”
Ms.
Buttenheim
said.Ms
.
Elgison
,
however
,
still
has
a
trump
card
she
hopes
might
work
.
“
I
would
like
my
son
to
get
it
so
we
can
all
travel
together
,
”
she
said
.
“
I
explained
to
him
that
it
’
s
possible
that
we
could
protect
his
dad.
”
Scott
Cohen
was
on
a
ventilator
struggling
for
his
life
with
Covid-19
last
April
when
his
brothers
pleaded
with
Plainview
Hospital
on
Long
Island
to
infuse
him
with
the
blood
plasma
of
a
recovered
patient.The
experimental
treatment
was
hard
to
get
but
was
gaining
attention
at
a
time
when
doctors
had
little
else
.
After
an
online
petition
drew
18,000
signatures
,
the
hospital
gave
Mr.
Cohen
,
a
retired
Nassau
County
medic
,
an
infusion
of
the
pale
yellow
stuff
that
some
called
“
liquid
gold.
”
In
those
terrifying
early
months
of
the
pandemic
,
the
idea
that
antibody-rich
plasma
could
save
lives
took
on
a
life
of
its
own
before
there
was
evidence
that
it
worked
.
The
Trump
administration
,
buoyed
by
proponents
at
elite
medical
institutions
,
seized
on
plasma
as
a
good-news
story
at
a
time
when
there
weren
’
t
many
others
.
It
awarded
more
than
$
800
million
to
entities
involved
in
its
collection
and
administration
,
and
put
Dr.
Anthony
S.
Fauci
’
s
face
on
billboards
promoting
the
treatment.Mr
.
Cohen
,
who
later
recovered
,
was
one
of
them
.
He
went
on
to
donate
his
own
plasma
11
times.But
by
the
end
of
the
year
,
good
evidence
for
convalescent
plasma
had
not
materialized
,
prompting
many
prestigious
medical
centers
to
quietly
abandon
it
.
By
February
,
with
cases
and
hospitalizations
dropping
,
demand
dipped
below
what
blood
banks
had
stockpiled
.
In
March
,
the
New
York
Blood
Center
called
Mr.
Cohen
to
cancel
his
12th
appointment
.
It
didn
’
t
need
any
more
plasma.A
year
ago
,
when
Americans
were
dying
of
Covid
at
an
alarming
rate
,
the
federal
government
made
a
big
bet
on
plasma
.
No
one
knew
if
the
treatment
would
work
,
but
it
seemed
biologically
plausible
and
safe
,
and
there
wasn
’
t
much
else
to
try
.
All
told
,
more
than
722,000
units
of
plasma
were
distributed
to
hospitals
thanks
to
the
federal
program
,
which
ends
this
month.The
government
’
s
bet
did
not
result
in
a
blockbuster
treatment
for
Covid-19
,
or
even
a
decent
one
.
But
it
did
give
the
country
a
real-time
education
in
the
pitfalls
of
testing
a
medical
treatment
in
the
middle
of
an
emergency
.
Medical
science
is
messy
and
slow
.
And
when
a
treatment
fails
,
which
is
often
,
it
can
be
difficult
for
its
strongest
proponents
to
let
it
go.Because
the
government
gave
plasma
to
so
many
patients
outside
of
a
controlled
clinical
trial
,
it
took
a
long
time
to
measure
its
effectiveness
.
Eventually
,
studies
did
emerge
to
suggest
that
under
the
right
conditions
,
plasma
might
help
.
But
enough
evidence
has
now
accumulated
to
show
that
the
country
’
s
broad
,
costly
plasma
campaign
had
little
effect
,
especially
in
people
whose
disease
was
advanced
enough
to
land
them
in
the
hospital.In
interviews
,
three
federal
health
officials
—
Dr.
Stephen
M.
Hahn
,
the
former
commissioner
of
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
;
Dr.
Peter
Marks
,
a
top
F.D.A
.
regulator
;
and
Dr.
H.
Clifford
Lane
,
a
clinical
director
at
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
—
acknowledged
that
the
evidence
for
plasma
was
limited.
“
The
data
are
just
not
that
strong
,
and
it
makes
it
makes
it
hard
,
I
think
,
to
be
enthusiastic
about
seeing
it
continue
to
be
used
,
”
Dr.
Lane
said
.
The
N.I.H
.
recently
halted
an
outpatient
trial
of
plasma
because
of
a
lack
of
benefit.Doctors
have
used
the
antibodies
of
recovered
patients
as
treatments
for
more
than
a
century
,
for
diseases
including
diphtheria
,
the
1918
flu
and
Ebola.So
when
patients
began
falling
ill
with
the
new
coronavirus
last
year
,
doctors
around
the
world
turned
to
the
old
standby.In
the
United
States
,
two
hospitals
—
Mount
Sinai
in
New
York
City
and
Houston
Methodist
in
Texas
—
administered
the
first
plasma
units
to
Covid-19
patients
within
hours
of
each
other
on
March
28.Dr
.
Nicole
M.
Bouvier
,
an
infectious-disease
doctor
who
helped
set
up
Mount
Sinai
’
s
plasma
program
,
said
the
hospital
had
tried
the
experimental
treatment
because
blood
transfusions
carry
a
relatively
low
risk
of
harm
.
With
a
new
virus
spreading
quickly
,
and
no
approved
treatments
,
“
nature
is
a
much
better
manufacturer
than
we
are
,
”
she
said.As
Mount
Sinai
prepared
to
infuse
patients
with
plasma
,
Diana
Berrent
,
a
photographer
,
was
recovering
from
Covid-19
at
her
home
in
Port
Washington
,
N.Y.
Friends
began
sending
her
Mount
Sinai
’
s
call
for
donors.
“
I
had
no
idea
what
plasma
was
—
I
haven
’
t
taken
a
science
class
since
high
school
,
”
Ms.
Berrent
recalled
.
But
as
she
researched
its
history
in
previous
disease
outbreaks
,
she
became
fixated
on
how
she
could
help.She
formed
a
Facebook
group
of
Covid-19
survivors
that
grew
to
more
than
160,000
members
and
eventually
became
a
health
advocacy
organization
,
Survivor
Corps
.
She
livestreamed
her
own
donation
sessions
to
the
Facebook
group
,
which
in
turn
prompted
more
donations.
“
People
were
flying
places
to
go
donate
plasma
to
each
other
,
”
she
said
.
“
It
was
really
a
beautiful
thing
to
see.
”
Around
the
same
time
,
Chaim
Lebovits
,
a
shoe
wholesaler
from
Monsey
,
N.Y.
,
in
hard-hit
Rockland
County
,
was
spreading
the
word
about
plasma
within
his
Orthodox
Jewish
community
.
Mr.
Lebovits
called
several
rabbis
he
knew
,
and
before
long
,
thousands
of
Orthodox
Jewish
people
were
getting
tested
for
coronavirus
antibodies
and
showing
up
to
donate
.
Coordinating
it
all
was
exhausting.
“
April
,
”
Mr.
Lebovits
recalled
with
a
laugh
,
“
was
like
20
decades.
”
Two
developments
that
month
further
accelerated
plasma
’
s
use
.
With
the
help
of
$
66
million
in
federal
funding
,
the
F.D.A
.
tapped
the
Mayo
Clinic
to
run
an
expanded
access
program
for
hospitals
across
the
country
.
And
the
government
agreed
to
cover
the
administrative
costs
of
collecting
plasma
,
signing
deals
with
the
American
Red
Cross
and
America
’
s
Blood
Centers.The
news
releases
announcing
those
deals
got
none
of
the
flashy
media
attention
that
the
billion-dollar
contracts
for
Covid-19
vaccines
did
when
they
arrived
later
in
the
summer
.
And
the
government
did
not
disclose
how
much
it
would
be
investing.That
investment
turned
out
to
be
significant
.
According
to
contract
records
,
the
U.S.
government
has
paid
$
647
million
to
the
American
Red
Cross
and
America
’
s
Blood
Centers
since
last
April.
“
The
convalescent
plasma
program
was
intended
to
meet
an
urgent
need
for
a
potential
therapy
early
in
the
pandemic
,
”
a
health
department
spokeswoman
said
in
a
statement
.
“
When
these
contracts
began
,
treatments
weren
’
t
available
for
hospitalized
Covid-19
patients.
”
As
spring
turned
to
summer
,
the
Trump
administration
seized
on
plasma
—
as
it
had
with
the
unproven
drug
hydroxychloroquine
—
as
a
promising
solution
.
In
July
,
the
administration
announced
an
$
8
million
advertising
campaign
“
imploring
Americans
to
donate
their
plasma
and
help
save
lives.
”
The
blitz
included
promotional
radio
spots
and
billboards
featuring
Dr.
Fauci
and
Dr.
Hahn
,
the
F.D.A
.
commissioner.A
coalition
to
organize
the
collection
of
plasma
was
beginning
to
take
shape
,
connecting
researchers
,
federal
officials
,
activists
like
Ms.
Berrent
and
Mr.
Lebovits
,
and
major
corporations
like
Microsoft
and
Anthem
on
regular
calls
that
have
continued
to
this
day
.
Nonprofit
blood
banks
and
for-profit
plasma
collection
companies
also
joined
the
collaboration
,
named
the
Fight
Is
In
Us.The
group
also
included
the
Mitre
Corporation
,
a
little-known
nonprofit
organization
that
had
received
a
$
37
million
government
grant
to
promote
plasma
donation
around
the
country.The
participants
sometimes
had
conflicting
interests
.
While
the
blood
banks
were
collecting
plasma
to
be
immediately
infused
in
hospitalized
patients
,
the
for-profit
companies
needed
plasma
donations
to
develop
their
own
blood-based
treatment
for
Covid-19
.
Donations
at
those
companies
’
own
centers
had
also
dropped
off
after
national
lockdowns.
“
They
don
’
t
all
exactly
get
along
,
”
Peter
Lee
,
the
corporate
vice
president
of
research
and
incubations
at
Microsoft
,
said
at
a
virtual
scientific
forum
in
March
organized
by
Scripps
Research.Microsoft
was
recruited
to
develop
a
locator
tool
,
embedded
on
the
group
’
s
website
,
for
potential
donors
.
But
the
company
took
on
a
broader
role
“
as
a
neutral
intermediary
,
”
Dr.
Lee
said.The
company
also
provided
access
to
its
advertising
agency
,
which
created
the
look
and
feel
for
the
Fight
Is
In
Us
campaign
,
which
included
video
testimonials
from
celebrities.In
August
,
the
F.D.A
.
authorized
plasma
for
emergency
use
under
pressure
from
President
Donald
J.
Trump
,
who
had
chastised
federal
scientists
for
moving
too
slowly.At
a
news
conference
,
Dr.
Hahn
,
the
agency
’
s
commissioner
,
substantially
exaggerated
the
data
,
although
he
later
corrected
his
remarks
following
criticism
from
the
scientific
community.In
a
recent
interview
,
he
said
that
Mr.
Trump
’
s
involvement
in
the
plasma
authorization
had
made
the
topic
polarizing.
“
Any
discussion
one
could
have
about
the
science
and
medicine
behind
it
didn
’
t
happen
,
because
it
became
a
political
issue
as
opposed
to
a
medical
and
scientific
one
,
”
Dr.
Hahn
said.The
authorization
did
away
with
the
Mayo
Clinic
system
and
opened
access
to
even
more
hospitals
.
As
Covid-19
cases
,
hospitalizations
and
deaths
skyrocketed
in
the
fall
and
winter
,
use
of
plasma
did
,
too
,
according
to
national
usage
data
provided
by
the
Blood
Centers
of
America
.
By
January
of
this
year
,
when
the
United
States
was
averaging
more
than
130,000
hospitalizations
a
day
,
hospitals
were
administering
25,000
units
of
plasma
per
week.Many
community
hospitals
serving
lower-income
patients
,
with
few
other
options
and
plasma
readily
available
,
embraced
the
treatment
.
At
the
Integris
Health
system
in
Oklahoma
,
giving
patients
two
units
of
plasma
became
standard
practice
between
November
and
January.Dr
.
David
Chansolme
,
the
system
’
s
medical
director
of
infection
prevention
,
acknowledged
that
studies
of
plasma
had
showed
it
was
“
more
miss
than
hit
,
”
but
he
said
his
hospitals
last
year
lacked
the
resources
of
bigger
institutions
,
including
access
to
the
antiviral
drug
remdesivir
.
Doctors
with
a
flood
of
patients
—
many
of
them
Hispanic
and
from
rural
communities
—
were
desperate
to
treat
them
with
anything
they
could
that
was
safe
,
Dr.
Chansolme
said.By
the
fall
,
accumulating
evidence
was
showing
that
plasma
was
not
the
miracle
that
some
early
boosters
had
believed
it
to
be
.
In
September
,
the
Infectious
Diseases
Society
of
America
recommended
that
plasma
not
be
used
in
hospitalized
patients
outside
of
a
clinical
trial
.
(
On
Wednesday
,
the
society
restricted
its
advice
further
,
saying
plasma
should
not
be
used
at
all
in
hospitalized
patients
.
)
In
January
,
a
highly
anticipated
trial
in
Britain
was
halted
early
because
there
was
not
strong
evidence
of
a
benefit
in
hospitalized
patients.In
February
,
the
F.D.A
.
narrowed
the
authorization
for
plasma
so
that
it
applied
only
to
people
who
were
early
in
the
course
of
their
disease
or
who
couldn
’
t
make
their
own
antibodies.Dr
.
Marks
,
the
F.D.A
.
regulator
,
said
that
in
retrospect
,
scientists
had
been
too
slow
to
adapt
to
those
recommendations
.
They
had
known
from
previous
disease
outbreaks
that
plasma
treatment
is
likely
to
work
best
when
given
early
,
and
when
it
contained
high
levels
of
antibodies
,
he
said.
“
Somehow
we
didn
’
t
really
take
that
as
seriously
as
perhaps
we
should
have
,
”
he
said
.
“
If
there
was
a
lesson
in
this
,
it
’
s
that
history
actually
can
teach
you
something.
”
Today
,
several
medical
centers
have
largely
stopped
giving
plasma
to
patients
.
At
Rush
University
Medical
Center
in
Chicago
,
researchers
found
that
many
hospitalized
patients
were
already
producing
their
own
antibodies
,
so
plasma
treatments
would
be
superfluous
.
The
Cleveland
Clinic
no
longer
routinely
administers
plasma
because
of
a
“
lack
of
convincing
evidence
of
efficacy
,
”
according
to
Dr.
Simon
Mucha
,
a
critical
care
physician.And
earlier
this
year
,
Mount
Sinai
stopped
giving
plasma
to
patients
outside
of
a
clinical
trial
.
Dr.
Bouvier
said
that
she
had
tracked
the
scientific
literature
and
that
there
had
been
a
“
sort
of
piling
on
”
of
studies
that
showed
no
benefit.
“
That
’
s
what
science
is
—
it
’
s
a
process
of
abandoning
your
old
hypotheses
in
favor
of
a
better
hypothesis
,
”
she
said
.
Many
initially
promising
drugs
fail
in
clinical
trials
.
“
That
’
s
just
the
way
the
cookie
crumbles.
”
Some
scientists
are
calling
on
the
F.D.A
.
to
rescind
plasma
’
s
emergency
authorization
.
Dr.
Luciana
Borio
,
the
acting
chief
scientist
at
the
agency
under
President
Barack
Obama
,
said
that
disregarding
the
usual
scientific
standards
in
an
emergency
—
what
she
called
“
pandemic
exceptionalism
”
—
had
drained
valuable
time
and
attention
from
discovering
other
treatments.
“
Pandemic
exceptionalism
is
something
we
learned
from
prior
emergencies
that
leads
to
serious
unintended
consequences
,
”
she
said
,
referring
to
the
ways
countries
leaned
on
inadequate
studies
during
the
Ebola
outbreak
.
With
plasma
,
she
said
,
“
the
agency
forgot
lessons
from
past
emergencies.
”
While
scant
evidence
shows
that
plasma
will
help
curb
the
pandemic
,
a
dedicated
clutch
of
researchers
at
prominent
medical
institutions
continue
to
focus
on
the
narrow
circumstances
in
which
it
might
work.Dr
.
Arturo
Casadevall
,
an
immunologist
at
Johns
Hopkins
University
,
said
many
of
the
trials
had
not
succeeded
because
they
tested
plasma
on
very
sick
patients
.
“
If
they
’
re
treated
early
,
the
results
of
the
trials
are
all
consistent
,
”
he
said.A
clinical
trial
in
Argentina
found
that
giving
plasma
early
to
older
people
reduced
the
progression
of
Covid-19
.
And
an
analysis
of
the
Mayo
Clinic
program
found
that
patients
who
were
given
plasma
with
a
high
concentration
of
antibodies
fared
better
than
those
who
did
not
receive
the
treatment
.
Still
,
in
March
,
the
N.I.H
.
halted
a
trial
of
plasma
in
people
who
were
not
yet
severely
ill
with
Covid-19
because
the
agency
said
it
was
unlikely
to
help.With
most
of
the
medical
community
acknowledging
plasma
’
s
limited
benefit
,
even
the
Fight
Is
In
Us
has
begun
to
shift
its
focus
.
For
months
,
a
“
clinical
research
”
page
about
convalescent
plasma
was
dominated
by
favorable
studies
and
news
releases
,
omitting
major
articles
concluding
that
plasma
showed
little
benefit.Now
,
the
website
has
been
redesigned
to
more
broadly
promote
not
only
plasma
,
but
also
testing
,
vaccines
and
other
treatments
like
monoclonal
antibodies
,
which
are
synthesized
in
a
lab
and
thought
to
be
a
more
potent
version
of
plasma
.
Its
clinical
research
page
also
includes
more
negative
studies
about
plasma.Nevertheless
,
the
Fight
Is
In
Us
is
still
running
Facebook
ads
,
paid
for
by
the
federal
government
,
telling
Covid-19
survivors
that
“
There
’
s
a
hero
inside
you
”
and
“
Keep
up
the
fight.
”
The
ads
urge
them
to
donate
their
plasma
,
even
though
most
blood
banks
have
stopped
collecting
it.Two
of
plasma
’
s
early
boosters
,
Mr.
Lebovits
and
Ms.
Berrent
,
have
also
turned
their
attention
to
monoclonal
antibodies
.
As
he
had
done
with
plasma
last
spring
,
Mr.
Lebovits
helped
increase
acceptance
of
monoclonals
in
the
Orthodox
Jewish
community
,
setting
up
an
informational
hotline
,
running
ads
in
Orthodox
newspapers
,
and
creating
rapid
testing
sites
that
doubled
as
infusion
centers
.
Coordinating
with
federal
officials
,
Mr.
Lebovits
has
since
shared
his
strategies
with
leaders
in
the
Hispanic
community
in
El
Paso
and
San
Diego.And
Ms.
Berrent
has
been
working
with
a
division
of
the
insurer
UnitedHealth
to
match
the
right
patients
—
people
with
underlying
health
conditions
or
who
are
over
65
—
to
that
treatment.
“
I
’
m
a
believer
in
plasma
for
a
lot
of
substantive
reasons
,
but
if
word
came
back
tomorrow
that
jelly
beans
worked
better
,
we
’
d
be
promoting
jelly
beans
,
”
she
said
.
“
We
are
here
to
save
lives.

An
18-year-old
woman
was
stricken
with
severe
headaches
,
vomiting
,
seizures
,
confusion
and
weakness
in
one
arm
early
this
month
,
strokelike
symptoms
that
doctors
at
a
Nevada
hospital
were
shocked
to
see
in
someone
so
young.Scans
found
several
large
blood
clots
blocking
veins
that
drain
blood
from
the
brain
,
a
condition
that
can
disable
or
kill
a
patient.Doctors
performed
a
procedure
to
suction
huge
clots
from
her
brain
,
only
to
find
that
new
ones
had
formed.The
patient
is
one
of
six
women
ages
18
to
48
who
developed
clots
in
the
brain
within
two
weeks
of
receiving
the
Johnson
&
Johnson
coronavirus
vaccine
.
One
died
,
and
their
devastating
cases
led
U.S.
health
officials
to
recommend
on
Tuesday
that
use
of
the
vaccine
be
paused.Two
more
cases
have
been
added
since
then
:
one
involving
a
man
who
was
vaccinated
during
the
company
’
s
clinical
trials
and
another
involving
a
woman
who
received
the
vaccine
after
it
had
been
authorized
for
general
use.As
in
several
of
the
original
cases
,
the
young
woman
in
Nevada
was
initially
treated
with
heparin
,
a
standard
blood-thinner
that
experts
have
since
learned
may
actually
worsen
the
rare
clotting
disorder
that
has
affected
small
numbers
of
people
who
received
the
Johnson
&
Johnson
or
AstraZeneca
vaccines
in
several
countries
.
But
until
the
last
few
weeks
,
doctors
around
the
world
had
little
information
about
the
condition
,
and
the
doctors
in
Nevada
did
not
recognize
it
immediately.
“
We
were
flying
blind
,
based
on
reports
from
Europe
and
the
U.K.
hematological
society
,
”
said
Dr.
Brian
Lipman
,
an
infectious-disease
specialist
who
helped
care
for
the
Nevada
patient
at
Dignity
Health
St.
Rose
Dominican
Hospital
,
Siena
Campus
,
in
Henderson.The
U.S.
decision
to
call
for
suspension
of
the
use
of
the
vaccine
was
intended
to
give
officials
time
to
learn
more
about
the
rare
disorder
causing
the
clots
,
to
assess
whether
it
is
linked
to
the
vaccine
and
to
inform
doctors
and
patients
about
how
to
recognize
symptoms
and
treat
the
condition.The
pause
may
last
until
at
least
next
Friday
,
when
expert
advisers
to
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
are
scheduled
to
meet
to
review
the
data
and
decide
whether
to
resume
using
the
vaccine
.
Dr.
Rochelle
Walensky
,
the
director
of
the
C.D.C.
,
and
other
top
U.S.
health
officials
sought
on
Friday
to
reassure
the
public
that
the
pause
,
now
extended
more
than
a
week
,
was
a
reasonable
safeguard
to
assess
risk
.
They
also
emphasized
that
over
all
,
the
Johnson
&
Johnson
vaccine
and
the
other
vaccines
in
use
in
the
United
States
were
safe
,
given
how
many
millions
of
Americans
had
gotten
their
shots
without
concern.But
with
the
world
staggered
by
a
relentless
epidemic
,
even
temporarily
stopping
the
use
of
a
highly
effective
vaccine
,
which
many
countries
had
planned
to
deploy
,
is
a
fraught
decision
.
Public
health
experts
fear
that
the
move
sends
a
message
that
will
erode
trust
globally
even
if
the
vaccine
is
reinstated
and
that
huge
numbers
of
people
who
could
have
been
immunized
will
die
needlessly
from
Covid-19
because
they
or
their
governments
rejected
the
company
’
s
vaccine.The
United
States
,
where
Johnson
&
Johnson
provided
only
about
5
percent
of
the
Covid
vaccine
supply
,
can
afford
the
suspension
:
It
has
plenty
of
other
vaccine
doses
from
Moderna
and
Pfizer-BioNTech
to
fill
the
gap
.
Other
countries
do
not
.
And
many
nations
have
also
stopped
or
limited
the
use
of
another
effective
vaccine
,
the
one
made
by
AstraZeneca
,
because
it
,
too
,
has
been
linked
to
a
similar
rare
clotting
disorder.About
7.4
million
Americans
have
received
the
Johnson
&
Johnson
vaccine
,
and
so
far
,
only
eight
cases
of
the
clotting
problem
have
been
reported
,
seven
of
them
in
women
.
In
Europe
,
Britain
,
and
three
other
countries
,
222
cases
have
been
reported
,
mostly
in
women
under
60
—
of
34
million
people
who
have
received
the
AstraZeneca
vaccine
.
Several
countries
have
now
limited
its
use
to
older
adults
because
so
many
cases
have
involved
younger
people.Researchers
suspect
that
in
these
rare
cases
,
the
vaccine
causes
an
intense
reaction
by
the
patient
’
s
immune
system
,
which
churns
out
antibodies
that
activate
platelets
,
a
blood
component
needed
for
clotting
.
An
unusual
syndrome
results
,
with
extensive
clotting
that
leaves
the
patient
with
low
platelet
levels
and
a
tendency
to
bleed
at
the
same
time
.
Why
this
occurs
in
some
people
,
many
of
them
younger
women
,
is
not
known
,
and
experts
say
that
they
have
so
far
been
unable
to
identify
traits
or
underlying
conditions
that
may
make
some
people
susceptible.In
a
statement
issued
on
Wednesday
,
Johnson
&
Johnson
said
:
“
The
safety
and
well-being
of
the
people
who
use
our
products
is
our
number
one
priority
,
and
we
strongly
support
awareness
of
the
signs
and
symptoms
of
this
extremely
rare
event
to
ensure
the
correct
diagnosis
,
appropriate
treatment
and
expedited
reporting
by
health
care
professionals
.
We
continue
to
believe
in
the
positive
benefit-risk
profile
of
our
vaccine.
”
The
company
also
said
,
in
a
letter
published
on
Friday
in
The
New
England
Journal
of
Medicine
,
that
no
causal
link
had
been
established
between
its
vaccine
and
the
clotting
disorder.To
some
critics
,
it
makes
no
sense
to
hobble
a
global
vaccination
campaign
during
a
pandemic
just
because
of
a
few
cases
of
a
rare
disorder.But
while
rare
side
effects
may
be
tolerated
as
the
price
we
must
pay
for
some
drugs
or
vaccines
,
even
the
rarest
ones
are
difficult
to
accept
if
they
are
severe
and
unpredictable
—
like
blood
clots
in
the
brain
,
especially
in
young
,
healthy
people.
“
This
is
a
devastating
complication
,
”
Dr.
Anthony
Fauci
,
the
chief
medical
adviser
for
the
pandemic
in
the
Biden
administration
,
said
in
an
interview.He
added
:
“
One
woman
died
,
three
are
in
the
hospital
,
one
in
intensive
care
.
Even
though
the
numbers
are
small
,
it
is
a
devastating
complication
,
so
I
believe
—
I
didn
’
t
make
the
decision
—
I
believe
their
rationale
,
at
least
from
what
they
communicated
to
me
,
is
that
they
wanted
to
call
a
quick
pause
to
see
,
to
alert
people
.
Sometimes
this
starts
with
minor
symptoms
,
like
a
little
abdominal
discomfort
,
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
they
wind
up
having
a
stroke.
”
He
also
said
,
“
Maybe
there
are
a
lot
more
people
out
there
we
’
re
not
noticing
,
because
of
the
spectrum
of
the
disease.
”
Informing
doctors
and
the
public
of
the
symptoms
—
severe
headaches
,
shortness
of
breath
,
leg
or
abdominal
pain
—
could
help
identify
more
cases.Another
reason
for
the
pause
,
Dr.
Fauci
said
,
is
to
let
doctors
know
that
the
drug
heparin
,
a
standard
treatment
for
blood
clots
,
should
not
be
given
to
these
patients
,
“
because
heparin
in
this
circumstance
can
make
things
worse.
”
It
is
not
known
whether
the
heparin
initially
given
to
some
of
the
patients
exacerbated
their
condition.Experts
are
recommending
the
use
of
other
blood
thinners
,
which
patients
urgently
need
,
because
their
blood
clots
keep
growing
,
and
new
ones
keep
forming
.
Doctors
in
Europe
who
treated
recipients
of
the
AstraZeneca
vaccine
who
had
a
similar
condition
said
it
could
worsen
rapidly.
“
The
real
issue
is
how
long
they
take
to
make
up
their
mind
about
what
they
’
re
going
to
do
,
”
Dr.
Fauci
said
of
the
C.D.C.
’
s
advisory
panel
.
“
The
rest
of
the
world
is
watching
this
,
and
J.
&
J
.
is
hopefully
going
to
be
an
important
part
of
the
worldwide
response
,
as
is
AstraZeneca.
”
He
added
,
“
You
don
’
t
want
to
rush
them
,
but
I
hope
they
make
up
their
minds
in
a
reasonable
amount
of
time.
”
Another
of
the
first
six
patients
with
the
clotting
condition
was
a
healthy
48-year-old
woman
who
went
to
an
emergency
room
in
Nebraska
because
she
had
felt
ill
with
abdominal
pain
for
three
days
.
Her
case
was
described
in
a
letter
to
the
editor
of
The
New
England
Journal
of
Medicine
published
on
Wednesday
.
Her
platelet
count
was
low
,
and
other
blood
tests
were
also
abnormal
.
A
C.T
.
scan
found
extensive
blood
clots
in
veins
in
her
abdomen
.
She
began
having
headaches
,
and
another
scan
found
clots
in
her
brain.She
was
given
heparin
.
More
clots
developed
,
and
she
had
a
hemorrhagic
stroke.Doctors
then
learned
that
she
had
received
the
Johnson
&
Johnson
vaccine
two
weeks
before
.
They
stopped
the
heparin
and
gave
her
a
different
blood
thinner
,
along
with
intravenous
immune
globulin
,
a
treatment
also
recommended
for
the
clotting
disorder
.
Her
platelet
count
increased
,
but
,
the
doctors
wrote
,
“
The
patient
remained
critically
ill
at
the
time
of
this
report.
”
The
young
woman
in
Nevada
was
fighting
for
her
life
and
had
to
be
placed
on
a
ventilator
,
according
to
Dr.
Lipman
.
He
said
he
was
speaking
independently
and
not
as
a
representative
of
the
hospital.The
patient
’
s
family
declined
a
request
for
an
interview.Dr
.
Lipman
said
that
as
the
team
had
studied
her
blood
samples
,
the
pieces
began
to
fall
into
place
,
and
they
realized
that
she
appeared
to
have
the
same
problem
that
they
knew
had
been
occurring
in
Britain
and
Europe
after
patients
received
the
AstraZeneca
vaccine
,
mostly
in
young
women
.
They
switched
from
heparin
to
another
blood-thinner
and
began
following
guidance
provided
by
doctors
in
Britain
who
had
treated
AstraZeneca
recipients
with
a
similar
disorder.Hoping
for
more
information
about
the
condition
and
any
possible
connection
to
the
Johnson
&
Johnson
vaccine
,
Dr.
Lipman
called
an
emergency
number
at
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
.
It
was
a
weekend
,
and
he
said
the
person
who
answered
told
him
that
no
one
was
available
to
help
and
that
the
line
had
to
be
kept
open
for
emergencies.
“
I
thought
this
was
an
emergency
,
”
Dr.
Lipman
said
.
“
She
hung
up
on
me.
”
He
called
back
,
to
ask
how
to
reach
Janssen
,
which
makes
the
Johnson
&
Johnson
vaccine
.
That
information
was
not
available
,
and
he
said
the
person
who
answered
had
also
told
him
that
the
F.D.A
.
could
not
provide
advice
on
patient
care.An
F.D.A
.
spokeswoman
,
Stephanie
Caccomo
,
said
in
an
email
,
“
We
’
ll
look
into
this
further
to
ensure
physicians
calling
F.D.A
.
for
assistance
receive
the
help
they
are
seeking.
”
Dr
.
Lipman
said
that
the
pharmacist
at
his
hospital
had
submitted
a
report
online
to
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
in
early
April
but
that
the
agency
had
not
contacted
him
to
ask
about
the
case
until
this
week
.
The
agency
declined
to
comment
on
whether
it
had
communicated
with
Dr.
Lipman
,
a
spokeswoman
,
Kristen
Nordlund
,
said
by
email.At
a
meeting
on
Wednesday
of
a
C.D.C
.
advisory
panel
,
Johnson
&
Johnson
and
Dr.
Tom
Shimabukuro
,
a
safety
expert
at
the
agency
,
both
presented
data
about
the
young
woman
in
Nevada
.
After
the
meeting
,
Nevada
officials
issued
a
statement
saying
the
meeting
was
the
first
time
they
had
learned
of
a
case
in
their
state
—
they
had
previously
told
the
public
that
no
cases
had
been
reported
—
and
they
were
asking
“
federal
partners
”
why
the
state
had
not
been
informed.At
the
Nevada
hospital
,
an
interventional
radiologist
passed
a
tube
through
blood
vessels
and
on
into
the
young
woman
’
s
brain
and
used
a
device
to
suction
out
the
blood
clots
.
More
clots
formed
later
,
and
he
performed
the
procedure
again.But
the
condition
causes
more
than
clots
:
The
patient
,
like
others
,
also
had
a
brain
hemorrhage.She
was
transferred
to
a
larger
hospital
,
where
she
is
still
on
a
ventilator
,
Dr.
Lipman
said
.
Her
prognosis
is
uncertain
,
he
said
,
adding
,
“
Her
life
,
not
just
her
life
,
her
entire
family
’
s
life
,
has
been
transformed.
”
As
the
pandemic
winds
down
in
the
U.S.
,
companies
are
preparing
to
bring
millions
of
employees
back
into
the
office.The
argument
many
employers
are
making
is
that
being
in
the
office
is
essential
for
collaboration
and
innovation
.
They
say
that
fresh
insights
and
keen
decision
making
are
born
out
of
chance
encounters
and
spontaneous
meetings.But
is
that
true
?
My
colleague
Claire
Cain
Miller
,
who
writes
about
gender
and
the
future
of
work
,
dug
into
this
question
and
found
that
not
only
is
there
no
evidence
to
back
up
that
argument
,
but
that
in
some
cases
,
the
opposite
may
be
true
.
The
office
stifles
creativity
because
it
can
create
an
inhospitable
environment
for
many
people.
“
Long
hours
of
face-time
requirements
in
the
office
are
often
worse
for
many
women
,
many
people
of
color
,
people
who
have
caregiving
responsibilities
,
people
with
disabilities
,
people
who
are
shy
,
”
Claire
said
.
“
And
when
you
lose
those
people
you
’
re
losing
diversity
,
and
the
ideas
that
come
with
people
from
diverse
backgrounds.
”
Remote
work
,
however
,
can
enable
ideas
to
bubble
up
from
people
with
varied
backgrounds
.
People
who
are
not
comfortable
speaking
up
in
an
in-person
meeting
may
feel
more
able
to
participate
in
a
virtual
setting
.
Brainstorming
sessions
using
apps
like
Slack
can
uncover
many
more
perspectives
by
including
people
who
wouldn
’
t
have
otherwise
been
invited
to
a
meeting
,
like
interns
or
employees
from
other
departments.Companies
insisting
on
in-person
work
may
also
be
overlooking
one
of
the
big
takeaways
from
the
country
’
s
mass
experiment
in
working
from
home
.
Even
as
the
virus
terrified
workers
,
sickened
millions
and
devastated
entire
industries
,
a
funny
thing
happened
:
“
It
worked
out
really
well
for
many
white-collar
workers
,
”
Claire
said.Sure
,
many
parents
had
their
kids
home
from
school
and
workers
were
constantly
worried
about
getting
sick
,
but
for
many
“
it
was
good
for
productivity
,
and
work-life
balance
,
”
Claire
said
.
But
corporate
culture
is
hard
to
change
because
companies
tend
to
stick
with
what
they
know
,
Claire
said
.
Employers
may
be
wary
of
allowing
people
to
work
from
home
indefinitely
;
it
requires
a
lot
of
trust
in
employees.
“
People
who
are
making
these
decisions
are
usually
managers
,
and
they
are
the
people
that
like
to
have
visibility
into
what
their
employees
are
doing
,
”
Claire
said
.
“
The
people
who
are
making
these
decisions
are
also
the
same
people
who
have
back-to-back
meetings
all
day
—
and
a
long
day
of
meetings
on
Zoom
is
not
that
fun.

Our
colleague
Caity
Weaver
investigates.This
is
hardly
the
first
time
that
humanity
has
faced
a
coronavirus
pandemic
.
It
may
not
be
the
last
time
we
emerge
from
one
,
either.Researchers
have
found
evidence
in
human
genes
that
a
coronavirus
epidemic
swept
East
Asia
some
20,000
years
ago
.
The
finding
could
be
useful
in
drug
development.
“
This
is
the
first
time
that
people
have
found
evidence
of
another
coronavirus
from
deep
time
,
from
our
very
,
very
ancient
forebears
,
”
Carl
Zimmer
,
our
colleague
from
the
Science
desk
,
told
us
.
“
This
was
a
pandemic
that
was
so
big
in
East
Asia
that
it
left
a
mark
on
their
DNA
for
thousands
of
generations.
”
It
plagued
the
region
for
years
,
a
finding
that
could
prophesy
our
fate
if
we
do
not
get
this
coronavirus
under
control
soon
through
vaccinations
.
And
disturbingly
,
the
coronavirus
appears
to
have
circulated
at
a
time
when
people
were
still
living
in
small
hunter-gatherer
bands
instead
of
big
cities
,
pointing
to
the
potency
of
contagion.
“
It
should
make
us
worry
,
”
said
David
Enard
,
an
evolutionary
biologist
at
the
University
of
Arizona
who
led
the
study
.
“
What
is
going
on
right
now
might
be
going
on
for
generations
and
generations.
”
The
researchers
looked
at
DNA
in
the
parts
of
the
human
genome
known
to
be
crucial
in
fighting
coronaviruses
.
In
those
genes
,
the
scientists
looked
for
evidence
of
rapid
evolution
.
(
People
with
a
specific
mutation
would
have
been
more
likely
to
survive
a
coronavirus
infection
while
those
without
it
would
probably
have
died
.
)
In
East
Asian
populations
,
but
not
others
,
Enard
found
that
42
of
the
coronavirus-specific
genes
had
dominant
versions
that
evolved
at
the
same
time.
“
Those
42
genes
went
through
an
evolutionary
change
all
at
the
same
time
,
”
Carl
said
.
“
That
is
a
sign
of
the
kind
of
evolution
you
’
d
expect
if
humans
were
being
hit
all
at
once
with
a
massive
pandemic
,
so
that
all
of
these
genes
were
being
selected
at
the
same
time
for
survival.
”
This
finding
could
have
big
implications
for
the
scientists
trying
to
design
drugs
to
help
us
fight
our
way
out
of
the
current
pandemic.
“
We
might
be
able
to
get
some
ideas
about
how
we
can
manipulate
those
genes
to
do
an
even
better
job
of
fighting
this
new
coronavirus

How
did
the
Covid-19
pandemic
begin
?
From
the
outbreak
’
s
early
days
,
most
scientists
assumed
that
the
virus
,
SARS-CoV-2
,
had
jumped
from
an
animal
to
a
person
in
late
2019
,
possibly
at
a
meat
market
in
Wuhan
,
China
,
the
city
of
11
million
where
the
first
known
Covid
cases
were
identified
.
But
in
May
,
The
Times
reported
that
U.S.
intelligence
agencies
were
investigating
another
explanation
that
had
been
debated
for
months
:
that
the
virus
had
accidentally
escaped
from
a
lab.How
did
this
idea
,
once
dismissed
as
a
conspiracy
theory
,
become
a
plausible
hypothesis
for
the
virus
’
s
origins
?
And
why
now
?
Here
’
s
what
people
are
saying.In
late
January
of
2020
,
after
Wuhan
was
placed
under
lockdown
,
The
Lancet
published
a
paper
by
Chinese
scientists
positing
that
the
virus
had
come
from
bats
,
perhaps
by
way
of
another
animal
at
the
Wuhan
meat
market
.
It
remains
a
reasonable
assumption
to
have
made
:
This
kind
of
animal-to-human
transmission
,
known
as
zoonotic
spillover
,
is
believed
to
be
responsible
for
two-thirds
of
human
infectious
diseases
,
including
Ebola
,
SARS
and
many
types
of
the
flu.But
in
February
2020
,
two
Chinese
researchers
suggested
in
a
since-withdrawn
paper
that
SARS-CoV-2
had
“
probably
originated
”
in
one
of
two
laboratories
—
the
Wuhan
Institute
of
Virology
or
the
Wuhan
Center
for
Disease
Control
.
Both
conduct
some
of
the
world
’
s
most
extensive
research
on
bat
coronaviruses
through
the
collection
of
cave
samples
,
often
yielding
important
findings
:
In
2017
,
an
esteemed
virologist
at
the
Wuhan
Institute
,
Shi
Zhengli
,
was
able
to
trace
SARS
,
which
broke
out
in
2002
,
back
to
a
colony
of
horseshoe
bats
.
Shi
went
on
to
publish
some
of
the
most
important
early
research
on
SARS-CoV-2.There
have
long
been
concerns
,
though
,
that
such
intimate
study
of
bat-borne
viruses
could
itself
cause
a
spillover
event.Some
believe
that
Shi
’
s
team
was
responsible
not
just
for
accidentally
leaking
SARS-CoV-2
,
but
also
for
creating
it
.
In
a
controversial
study
in
2015
,
a
University
of
North
Carolina
lab
used
data
from
Shi
—
and
funding
from
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
—
to
engineer
a
coronavirus
capable
of
infecting
human
airway
cells
.
Some
scientists
argue
that
this
type
of
research
,
known
as
gain-of-function
,
is
useful
for
anticipating
potential
pandemics
.
But
others
have
criticized
it
as
too
risky
,
stirring
speculation
about
whether
SARS-CoV-2
might
have
been
engineered
in
Dr.
Shi
’
s
lab
before
escaping.Shi
,
for
her
part
,
has
vehemently
denied
both
forms
of
the
lab-leak
theory
:
She
told
The
Times
last
week
that
her
lab
has
never
conducted
gain-of-function
experiments
to
enhance
the
virulence
of
viruses
.
A
natural
spillover
event
was
also
not
a
possibility
,
she
insisted
last
July
,
because
there
had
been
“
zero
infection
”
of
SARS-CoV-2
at
the
Wuhan
Institute
.
The
Wuhan
Center
has
likewise
denied
any
infections.But
China
’
s
refusal
to
allow
an
independent
investigation
has
made
it
difficult
to
validate
these
claims
.
White
House
officials
have
stood
in
the
way
too
,
in
part
out
of
a
desire
not
to
draw
attention
to
the
government
’
s
financial
ties
to
the
Wuhan
Institute
and
gain-of-function
research
,
Katherine
Eban
reports
for
Vanity
Fair.There
are
certainly
some
serious
scientists
who
think
it
’
s
a
possible
,
even
probable
explanation
.
One
is
David
Relman
,
a
Stanford
microbiologist
,
who
has
been
calling
for
a
more
thorough
investigation
of
the
virus
’
s
origins
since
last
year.But
to
many
scientists
,
these
details
aren
’
t
necessarily
reason
to
doubt
the
natural
origin
theory
.
After
all
,
it
took
Shi
15
years
to
discover
the
source
of
SARS
,
and
she
discovered
it
hundreds
of
miles
away
from
where
that
disease
first
broke
out
.
Susan
Weiss
,
a
virologist
and
coronavirus
expert
at
the
University
of
Pennsylvania
,
cites
the
aphorism
about
what
animal
one
should
expect
from
the
sound
of
hoofbeats
.
“
You
know
the
thing
about
horses
and
zebras
,
”
she
told
The
Washington
Post
.
“
Zoonosis
is
the
horse
,
and
the
lab
leak
is
the
zebra.
”
Robert
Garry
Jr.
,
a
Tulane
virologist
,
is
similarly
convinced
of
the
virus
’
s
natural
origin
.
“
I
think
people
are
frustrated
,
and
a
lot
of
people
are
looking
for
somebody
to
hang
this
on
,
”
he
told
The
Post.Increasingly
,
though
,
scientists
are
expressing
uncertainty
.
“
I
’
m
completely
open-minded
about
the
possibilities
,
”
Akiko
Iwasaki
,
a
Yale
immunologist
,
told
The
Times
.
“
There
’
s
so
little
evidence
for
either
of
these
things
,
that
it
’
s
almost
like
a
tossup.
”
And
it
could
very
well
stay
that
way
.
“
The
maddening
aspect
of
this
story
is
that
—
despite
the
big
fuss
being
made
right
now
—
the
facts
on
both
sides
are
still
incredibly
thin
,
”
the
science
journalist
and
former
Times
reporter
Donald
McNeil
Jr.
told
The
Post
.
“
This
debate
isn
’
t
over
,
and
it
won
’
t
be
until
more
facts
are
unearthed
—
if
they
ever
are.
”
No
new
hard
evidence
for
the
lab
leak
theory
has
emerged
,
but
a
few
events
helped
propel
it
back
into
the
mainstream
in
May
,
including
a
letter
in
Science
magazine
from
18
scientists
calling
for
a
transparent
and
independent
investigation
into
the
origins
of
SARS-CoV-2
.
About
a
week
later
,
The
Wall
Street
Journal
reported
that
according
to
U.S.
intelligence
,
three
researchers
at
the
Wuhan
Institute
had
sought
medical
care
for
“
symptoms
consistent
with
both
Covid-19
and
common
seasonal
illness
”
in
November
2019.But
the
lab
leak
theory
has
also
attracted
interest
as
a
cautionary
tale
about
groupthink
,
political
polarization
and
overlapping
crises
of
expertise
.
In
the
United
States
,
one
of
the
theory
’
s
earliest
high-profile
promoters
was
Republican
Senator
Tom
Cotton
of
Arkansas
,
a
China
hawk
and
a
loyal
ally
of
former
President
Donald
Trump
,
who
argued
in
February
of
2020
that
“
China
lied
”
about
the
origins
of
the
virus
and
suggested
it
had
come
from
a
“
super-lab.
”
In
short
order
,
the
Trump
administration
and
his
campaign
started
suggesting
the
pandemic
was
a
Chinese
plot
to
derail
his
re-election.This
politicization
of
the
inquiry
into
the
virus
’
s
origins
gave
rise
to
a
false
consensus
in
parts
of
the
press
.
“
It
is
understandable
that
authorities
,
including
public
health
experts
and
journalists
,
responded
to
the
crisis
with
initial
confusion
,
”
the
journalist
Jonathan
Chait
writes
.
“
But
they
erred
on
the
side
of
certainty
when
they
ought
to
have
erred
on
the
side
of
uncertainty
.
And
the
false
certainty
they
embraced
at
the
outset
of
2020
hardened
into
a
dogma
that
they
did
not
question
for
far
too
long.
”
Even
starker
reversals
in
consensus
around
masking
and
aerosol
transmission
suggest
that
public-health
authorities
also
have
some
introspection
to
do
.
“
Science
values
possibility
,
but
people
value
certainty
,
”
Maddie
Bender
writes
in
Vice
.
“
So
far
,
science
communication
hasn
’
t
been
able
to
bridge
the
two
successfully
.
And
during
the
largest
public
health
crisis
of
a
generation
,
that
disconnect
has
had
disastrous
consequences.
”
One
such
consequence
is
that
the
lab
leak
theory
has
become
a
political
football
,
both
between
Democrats
and
Republicans
and
between
the
U.S.
and
Chinese
governments
.
But
if
science
can
not
float
above
politics
,
it
must
hope
at
least
to
find
a
way
through
it
,
Relman
says
,
because
the
stakes
for
public
health
are
exceedingly
high.
“
If
we
find
more
concrete
evidence
of
a
‘
spillover
’
event
with
SARS-CoV-2
passing
directly
from
bat
to
human
,
then
efforts
to
understand
and
manage
the
bat-human
interface
need
to
be
significantly
strengthened
,
”
he
writes
.
“
But
if
SARS-CoV-2
escaped
from
a
lab
to
cause
the
pandemic
,
it
will
become
critical
to
understand
the
chain
of
events
and
prevent
this
from
happening
again.

The
countries
of
Southeast
Asia
largely
escaped
the
worst
of
the
coronavirus
pandemic
during
its
first
year
.
But
now
,
as
more
infectious
variants
take
hold
,
the
region
is
suffering
from
new
outbreaks
and
lockdowns
and
lags
the
rest
of
the
world
in
vaccinations.
“
As
the
West
is
coming
out
if
it
,
we
’
re
probably
looking
at
months
and
months
of
more
deaths
and
spiraling
outbreaks
,
”
Hannah
Beech
,
the
Southeast
Asia
bureau
chief
for
The
Times
,
told
me.As
the
Delta
variant
rolls
across
the
globe
,
Indonesia
,
Myanmar
and
the
Philippines
in
particular
are
facing
frightening
waves.
“
Hospital
wards
in
Jakarta
,
Indonesia
’
s
capital
,
are
again
full
,
”
Hannah
said
.
“
There
are
not
enough
ventilators
.
People
who
were
involved
in
the
fight
against
Covid
—
frontline
medical
workers
and
others
—
are
dying
again.
”
And
they
are
not
vaccinating
fast
enough
to
combat
the
spread
.
The
region
’
s
middle-income
countries
“
kind
of
fell
through
the
cracks
,
”
Hannah
said
.
“
It
wasn
’
t
necessarily
easy
or
economically
advantageous
for
them
to
join
Covax
,
the
global
vaccine-sharing
initiative
.
But
they
weren
’
t
rich
enough
to
secure
vaccines
from
Western
countries.
”
Last
year
,
AstraZeneca
designated
Thailand
as
the
regional
hub
for
its
vaccine
and
awarded
a
manufacturing
contract
to
Siam
Bioscience
,
a
pharmaceutical
firm
controlled
by
the
king
of
Thailand
,
which
had
no
experience
making
vaccines.Then
,
earlier
this
month
,
many
hospitals
in
Thailand
canceled
vaccine
appointments
and
the
governments
of
Malaysia
,
the
Philippines
and
Taiwan
scaled
back
their
vaccine
programs
because
of
what
they
said
were
lower-than-expected
shipments
from
Thailand
.
(
Thailand
disputed
the
claims
.
)
Governments
have
also
“
used
the
pandemic
to
tighten
political
control
and
tamp
down
on
dissent
,
”
Hannah
said
.
“
States
of
emergency
that
are
ostensibly
about
the
pandemic
are
being
used
to
stop
dissidents
from
speaking
their
minds.
”
Today
’
s
outbreaks
are
a
far
cry
from
the
early
months
of
the
pandemic
,
when
theories
abounded
to
explain
the
region
’
s
relative
success
.
Was
it
because
people
were
used
to
masks
?
Or
just
luck
?
One
possible
answer
,
researchers
say
,
may
come
from
bats
:
Thailand
,
Laos
and
parts
of
Southwestern
China
are
home
to
a
species
that
scientists
think
may
have
carried
the
coronavirus
that
causes
Covid-19
.
Earlier
forms
of
the
coronavirus
may
have
been
circulating
in
the
region
for
years.
“
It
is
possible
that
people
within
this
region
were
exposed
to
an
earlier
version
of
the
coronavirus
that
could
have
,
while
not
totally
inoculating
them
,
made
them
less
prone
to
suffering
as
severely
from
the
initial
outbreak
,
”
Hannah
said.Some
of
our
readers
have
recently
shared
stories
about
getting
antibody
tests
after
receiving
their
coronavirus
vaccines
,
only
to
be
devastated
when
the
tests
came
back
negative.In
fact
,
experts
say
most
people
don
’
t
need
a
test
to
confirm
their
vaccine
’
s
efficacy
.
The
test
results
can
be
misleading
or
useless.Extensive
clinical
trials
have
already
shown
that
vaccines
authorized
in
the
United
States
trigger
a
strong
antibody
response
for
just
about
everyone
.
The
exceptions
are
people
with
weakened
immune
systems
or
those
who
take
certain
medications.To
get
a
reliable
answer
from
testing
,
vaccinated
people
would
have
to
get
a
specific
kind
of
test
at
the
right
time
.
Take
the
test
too
soon
,
or
rely
on
one
that
looks
for
the
wrong
antibodies
—
all
too
easy
to
do
,
given
the
befuddling
array
of
tests
now
available
—
and
you
may
believe
yourself
to
still
be
vulnerable
when
you
are
not.Our
colleague
Apoorva
Mandavilli
has
these
takeaways.The
advice
is
still
evolving
,
in
part
because
the
F.D.A
.
has
been
slow
to
wade
in.In
May
,
the
agency
recommended
against
the
use
of
antibody
tests
for
assessing
immunity
—
a
decision
that
has
drawn
criticism
from
some
scientists
—
and
provided
only
bare-bones
information
about
testing
to
health
care
providers
.
As
a
result
,
many
doctors
are
still
unaware
of
the
differences
between
antibody
tests.See

decision
released
Friday
:
Researchers
have
found
evidence
that
a
coronavirus
epidemic
swept
East
Asia
some
20,000
years
ago
and
was
devastating
enough
to
leave
an
evolutionary
imprint
on
the
DNA
of
people
alive
today.The
new
study
suggests
that
an
ancient
coronavirus
plagued
the
region
for
many
years
,
researchers
say
.
The
finding
could
have
dire
implications
for
the
Covid-19
pandemic
if
it
’
s
not
brought
under
control
soon
through
vaccination.
“
It
should
make
us
worry
,
”
said
David
Enard
,
an
evolutionary
biologist
at
the
University
of
Arizona
who
led
the
study
,
which
was
published
on
Thursday
in
the
journal
Current
Biology
.
“
What
is
going
on
right
now
might
be
going
on
for
generations
and
generations.
”
Until
now
,
researchers
could
not
look
back
very
far
into
the
history
of
this
family
of
pathogens
.
Over
the
past
20
years
,
three
coronaviruses
have
adapted
to
infect
humans
and
cause
severe
respiratory
disease
:
Covid-19
,
SARS
and
MERS
.
Studies
on
each
of
these
coronaviruses
indicate
that
they
jumped
into
our
species
from
bats
or
other
mammals.Four
other
coronaviruses
can
also
infect
people
,
but
they
usually
cause
only
mild
colds
.
Scientists
did
not
directly
observe
these
coronaviruses
becoming
human
pathogens
,
so
they
have
relied
on
indirect
clues
to
estimate
when
the
jumps
happened
.
Coronaviruses
gain
new
mutations
at
a
roughly
regular
rate
,
and
so
comparing
their
genetic
variation
makes
it
possible
to
determine
when
they
diverged
from
a
common
ancestor.The
most
recent
of
these
mild
coronaviruses
,
called
HCoV-HKU1
,
crossed
the
species
barrier
in
the
1950s
.
The
oldest
,
called
HCoV-NL63
,
may
date
back
as
far
as
820
years.But
before
that
point
,
the
coronavirus
trail
went
cold
—
until
Dr.
Enard
and
his
colleagues
applied
a
new
method
to
the
search
.
Instead
of
looking
at
the
genes
of
the
coronaviruses
,
the
researchers
looked
at
the
effects
on
the
DNA
of
their
human
hosts.Over
generations
,
viruses
drive
enormous
amounts
of
change
in
the
human
genome
.
A
mutation
that
protects
against
a
viral
infection
may
well
mean
the
difference
between
life
and
death
,
and
it
will
be
passed
down
to
offspring
.
A
lifesaving
mutation
,
for
example
,
might
allow
people
to
chop
apart
a
virus
’
s
proteins.But
viruses
can
evolve
,
too
.
Their
proteins
can
change
shape
to
overcome
a
host
’
s
defenses
.
And
those
changes
might
spur
the
host
to
evolve
even
more
counteroffensives
,
leading
to
more
mutations.When
a
random
new
mutation
happens
to
provide
resistance
to
a
virus
,
it
can
swiftly
become
more
common
from
one
generation
to
the
next
.
And
other
versions
of
that
gene
,
in
turn
,
become
rarer
.
So
if
one
version
of
a
gene
dominates
all
others
in
large
groups
of
people
,
scientists
know
that
is
most
likely
a
signature
of
rapid
evolution
in
the
past.In
recent
years
,
Dr.
Enard
and
his
colleagues
have
searched
the
human
genome
for
these
patterns
of
genetic
variation
in
order
to
reconstruct
the
history
of
an
array
of
viruses
.
When
the
pandemic
struck
,
he
wondered
whether
ancient
coronaviruses
had
left
a
distinctive
mark
of
their
own.He
and
his
colleagues
compared
the
DNA
of
thousands
of
people
across
26
different
populations
around
the
world
,
looking
at
a
combination
of
genes
known
to
be
crucial
for
coronaviruses
but
not
other
kinds
of
pathogens
.
In
East
Asian
populations
,
the
scientists
found
that
42
of
these
genes
had
a
dominant
version
.
That
was
a
strong
signal
that
people
in
East
Asia
had
adapted
to
an
ancient
coronavirus.But
whatever
happened
in
East
Asia
seemed
to
have
been
limited
to
that
region
.
“
When
we
compared
them
to
populations
around
the
world
,
we
couldn
’
t
find
the
signal
,
”
said
Yassine
Souilmi
,
a
postdoctoral
researcher
at
the
University
of
Adelaide
in
Australia
and
a
co-author
of
the
new
study.The
scientists
then
tried
to
estimate
how
long
ago
East
Asians
had
adapted
to
a
coronavirus
.
They
took
advantage
of
the
fact
that
once
a
dominant
version
of
a
gene
starts
being
passed
down
through
the
generations
,
it
can
gain
harmless
random
mutations
.
As
more
time
passes
,
more
of
those
mutations
accumulate.Dr
.
Enard
and
his
colleagues
found
that
the
42
genes
all
had
about
the
same
number
of
mutations
.
That
meant
that
they
had
all
rapidly
evolved
at
about
the
same
time
.
“
This
is
a
signal
we
should
absolutely
not
expect
by
chance
,
”
Dr.
Enard
said.They
estimated
that
all
of
those
genes
evolved
their
antiviral
mutations
sometime
between
20,000
and
25,000
years
ago
,
most
likely
over
the
course
of
a
few
centuries
.
It
’
s
a
surprising
finding
,
since
East
Asians
at
the
time
were
not
living
in
dense
communities
but
instead
formed
small
bands
of
hunter-gatherers.Aida
Andres
,
an
evolutionary
geneticist
at
the
University
College
London
who
was
not
involved
in
the
new
study
,
said
she
found
the
work
compelling
.
“
I
’
m
quite
convinced
there
’
s
something
there
,
”
she
said.Still
,
she
didn
’
t
think
it
was
possible
yet
to
make
a
firm
estimate
of
how
long
ago
the
ancient
epidemic
took
place
.
“
The
timing
is
a
complicated
thing
,
”
she
said
.
“
Whether
that
happened
a
few
thousand
years
before
or
after
—
I
personally
think
it
’
s
something
that
we
can
not
be
as
confident
of.
”
Scientists
looking
for
drugs
to
fight
the
new
coronavirus
might
want
to
scrutinize
the
42
genes
that
evolved
in
response
to
the
ancient
epidemic
,
Dr.
Souilmi
said
.
“
It
’
s
actually
pointing
us
to
molecular
knobs
to
adjust
the
immune
response
to
the
virus
,
”
he
said.Dr
.
Anders
agreed
,
saying
that
the
genes
identified
in
the
new
study
should
get
special
attention
as
targets
for
drugs
.
“
You
know
that
they
’
re
important
,
”
she
said
.
“
That
’
s
the
nice
thing
about
evolution.
”
The
pause
in
the
use
of
Johnson
&
Johnson
’
s
Covid-19
vaccine
may
continue
for
a
week
to
10
days
,
after
expert
advisers
to
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
determined
on
Wednesday
that
they
needed
more
time
to
assess
a
possible
link
to
a
rare
but
serious
blood-clotting
disorder.The
decision
not
to
reinstate
the
vaccine
has
painful
consequences
,
nationally
and
globally
.
It
may
further
erode
public
confidence
in
vaccination
in
general
and
slow
the
rollout
of
desperately
needed
shots
to
rural
and
underserved
areas
and
homebound
people
.
The
vaccine
is
considered
ideal
for
hard-to-reach
people
and
places
because
it
requires
only
one
shot
and
is
more
easily
stored
and
shipped
than
the
vaccines
made
by
Moderna
and
Pfizer-BioNTech
,
which
must
be
kept
at
very
low
temperatures.
“
Putting
this
vaccine
on
pause
,
for
those
of
us
that
are
frontline
health
care
workers
,
has
really
been
devastating
,
”
Dr.
Camille
Kotton
of
Harvard
Medical
School
told
the
panel
.
She
said
that
losing
the
Johnson
&
Johnson
vaccine
even
temporarily
represented
a
big
blow
to
efforts
to
stop
the
pandemic
,
especially
in
underserved
communities.The
pause
,
first
recommended
on
Tuesday
by
U.S.
health
officials
,
led
Johnson
&
Johnson
to
delay
its
rollout
of
the
vaccine
in
Europe
,
where
several
countries
were
poised
to
start
administering
it
this
week
.
The
continent
is
reeling
from
the
fallout
over
rare
cases
,
sometimes
fatal
,
of
a
similar
blood
disorder
that
has
prompted
several
nations
to
limit
or
reject
the
widespread
use
of
the
AstraZeneca-Oxford
vaccine
and
recommend
alternatives.South
Africa
,
devastated
by
a
worrisome
variant
of
the
virus
that
emerged
there
,
also
suspended
use
of
the
Johnson
&
Johnson
vaccine
.
Australia
announced
it
would
not
purchase
any
doses
.
And
the
European
Union
indicated
that
it
would
consider
new
deals
only
with
companies
that
were
not
using
the
technology
employed
by
the
Johnson
&
Johnson
or
AstraZeneca
vaccines.Noting
that
many
countries
follow
the
United
States
’
lead
when
it
comes
to
vaccines
,
Dr.
Grace
Lee
of
Stanford
University
,
an
expert
on
the
panel
,
said
that
although
the
committee
’
s
responsibility
was
to
the
United
States
,
“
I
also
feel
the
weight
of
the
burden
of
a
global
responsibility
that
we
also
have
and
the
impact
that
our
decision-making
can
potentially
worsen
inequities.
”
The
advisory
group
’
s
emergency
meeting
on
Wednesday
was
called
to
review
the
reason
for
the
pause
:
six
cases
of
rare
and
severe
blood
clots
in
the
brain
in
women
ages
18
to
48
,
one
of
whom
died
.
All
of
the
women
had
received
the
Johnson
&
Johnson
vaccine
before
developing
the
clots
,
although
it
is
unclear
whether
the
vaccine
was
responsible
.
In
addition
,
the
panel
learned
of
the
clotting
problem
in
a
seventh
woman
who
received
the
vaccine
after
it
was
authorized
,
and
in
a
man
who
received
it
during
its
clinical
trials.As
of
Tuesday
,
more
than
seven
million
people
in
the
United
States
had
received
the
Johnson
&
Johnson
shot
,
representing
about
5
percent
of
vaccinations
nationwide.Advisory
meetings
usually
end
with
a
vote
on
whether
or
how
to
use
a
vaccine
.
But
in
this
case
,
the
panel
members
declined
to
vote
after
reviewing
several
options
—
including
whether
to
limit
use
of
the
vaccine
to
older
adults
,
as
many
European
nations
have
done
—
saying
that
they
did
not
have
enough
information
to
assess
the
potential
risks.Doran
Fink
,
an
official
of
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
,
proposed
a
different
strategy
to
the
panel
,
suggesting
that
the
vaccine
could
go
back
into
use
while
researchers
continued
to
study
the
potential
risk
.
Doctors
and
patients
could
be
provided
with
information
about
the
findings
so
that
patients
could
consider
whether
to
accept
the
vaccine
.
“
Our
current
thinking
is
that
this
risk
could
be
managed
by
inclusion
of
warning
statements
,
”
Dr.
Fink
said.But
some
experts
on
the
C.D.C
.
panel
leaned
in
other
directions
,
fearing
that
more
patients
could
be
harmed
if
vaccinations
resumed
without
a
full
understanding
of
the
potential
risks
.
One
warned
that
the
rare
condition
could
cause
long-lasting
neurological
damage
.
Others
reminded
their
colleagues
of
the
risk
from
Covid
itself
,
and
the
message
the
panel
would
send
if
it
prolonged
a
suspension
in
the
use
of
a
one-and-done
vaccine.The
Advisory
Committee
on
Immunization
Practices
,
or
ACIP
,
is
a
panel
of
independent
experts
who
advise
the
C.D.C
.
on
its
vaccine
policies.The
clotting
disorder
of
concern
in
the
vaccine
recipients
is
different
—
and
much
rarer
—
from
typical
blood
clots
,
which
develop
in
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
every
year
.
The
seven
women
experienced
not
only
clotting
in
the
brain
but
a
notably
low
level
of
platelets
,
parts
of
the
blood
that
help
form
normal
clots
in
response
to
an
injury.None
of
the
women
had
recently
given
birth
,
which
can
increase
the
risk
of
more
common
blood
clots
,
and
only
one
was
known
to
be
taking
hormonal
treatment
.
So
far
,
there
is
no
evidence
that
birth
control
pills
,
which
can
also
raise
the
risk
of
blood
clots
,
were
involved.Three
of
the
women
had
large
,
dangerous
clots
in
other
parts
of
their
body
,
not
just
in
the
brain.The
rare
combination
of
severe
clots
and
low
platelets
stood
out
to
experts
as
a
safety
signal
.
Why
it
develops
is
not
known
,
and
so
far
there
is
no
way
to
predict
whether
an
individual
is
susceptible.The
condition
is
very
similar
to
one
linked
to
the
AstraZeneca
Covid
vaccine
,
also
affecting
some
relatively
young
women
in
Europe
,
where
that
vaccine
was
in
wide
use
.
Researchers
in
Germany
and
Norway
found
that
patients
there
had
developed
antibodies
that
activated
their
platelets
—
an
aberrant
response
to
the
vaccine
—
setting
off
a
cascade
of
clotting
and
bleeding
.
Specialized
blood
tests
can
detect
the
antibodies
to
confirm
the
diagnosis
,
and
some
of
the
U.S.
patients
tested
positive
.
Not
all
were
tested.Both
AstraZeneca
and
Johnson
&
Johnson
use
adenoviruses
to
ferry
DNA
into
human
cells
to
create
immunity
against
the
coronavirus
.
Researchers
suspect
that
some
aspect
of
that
technology
plays
a
role
in
the
blood
disorder
.
But
they
also
emphasize
that
because
the
condition
is
so
very
rare
,
some
quirk
of
biology
very
likely
predisposes
certain
people
to
have
a
bad
reaction
to
the
vaccine
.
If
the
vaccine
alone
were
responsible
,
there
would
be
many
more
cases
,
some
researchers
say.The
vaccines
made
by
Moderna
and
Pfizer-BioNTech
employ
genetic
material
called
mRNA
and
do
not
use
viruses.Much
of
the
world
had
been
counting
on
the
AstraZeneca
vaccine
to
fight
the
pandemic
,
but
many
countries
have
now
restricted
its
use
to
adults
older
than
30
or
50
,
and
some
have
stopped
using
it
altogether
.
Some
people
who
are
still
eligible
for
it
are
declining
it
out
of
fear
.
AstraZeneca
’
s
vaccine
has
not
been
authorized
in
the
United
States
,
although
the
company
is
expected
to
apply
for
permission
to
distribute
it
here.Use
of
the
Johnson
&
Johnson
vaccine
in
the
United
States
began
on
March
2
,
and
the
first
case
of
blood
clots
in
the
brain
was
reported
on
March
19
.
About
1.4
million
women
ages
20
to
50
—
the
age
range
of
those
who
had
the
clots
—
have
received
the
vaccine.The
panel
of
experts
discussed
the
known
background
rates
of
low
platelets
and
of
the
clots
in
the
brain
—
known
as
central
venous
sinus
thrombosis
—
in
the
general
population
and
in
younger
women
like
those
who
had
the
clots
,
but
noted
that
there
was
not
enough
data
to
precisely
estimate
how
often
the
two
conditions
occurred
at
the
same
time.But
based
on
rough
estimates
,
the
clotting
disorder
in
women
ages
20
to
50
who
received
the
Johnson
&
Johnson
vaccine
occurred
at
least
three
times
more
often
than
would
be
expected
,
according
to
Dr.
Tom
Shimabukuro
,
a
safety
expert
from
the
C.D.C.In
the
coming
weeks
,
he
said
,
the
rate
would
become
clearer
as
more
reports
arrived
.
“
We
’
ll
get
a
better
picture
of
what
’
s
going
on.
”
“
Right
now
,
we
believe
these
events
to
be
extremely
rare
,
but
we
are
also
not
yet
certain
we
have
heard
about
all
possible
cases
,
as
this
syndrome
may
not
be
easily
recognized
as
one
associated
with
the
vaccine
,
”
Dr.
Rochelle
P.
Walensky
,
the
C.D.C
.
director
,
said
at
a
White
House
news
conference
on
the
pandemic
on
Wednesday.During
the
panel
discussion
,
experts
noted
that
the
“
risk
window
”
for
the
condition
among
vaccine
recipients
was
still
open
and
that
new
cases
might
emerge
,
because
nearly
3.8
million
people
had
received
the
shot
within
the
last
two
weeks
.
In
the
six
women
,
the
severe
clotting
developed
within
about
two
weeks
of
the
shot.Other
experts
encouraged
dissemination
of
health
information
on
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
the
condition
so
that
awareness
would
spread
among
doctors
,
emergency
rooms
and
people
who
had
received
the
vaccine
.
A
key
point
is
that
the
blood-thinner
heparin
,
a
common
treatment
for
clots
,
can
harm
these
patients
and
should
not
be
used.Officials
also
noted
that
people
with
the
condition
needed
to
be
treated
as
soon
as
possible
because
the
clots
were
so
serious
.
Some
patients
needed
invasive
procedures
to
remove
large
clots
from
blood
vessels
in
their
brains.Several
panel
members
reiterated
that
two
other
vaccines
—
from
Moderna
and
Pfizer-BioNTech
—
are
available
,
neither
associated
with
the
clotting
problem
,
so
continuing
the
pause
would
not
stop
most
people
in
the
United
States
from
being
vaccinated.At
the
news
conference
,
Jeffrey
D.
Zients
,
the
White
House
’
s
pandemic
coordinator
,
said
that
the
pause
would
not
generally
interrupt
the
momentum
of
the
country
’
s
vaccination
campaign.
“
In
the
very
short
term
,
we
do
expect
some
impact
on
daily
averages
as
sites
and
appointments
transition
from
Johnson
&
Johnson
to
Moderna
and
Pfizer
vaccines
,
”
he
said
.
“
We
have
more
than
enough
Pfizer
and
Moderna
vaccine
supply
to
continue
or
even
accelerate
the
current
pace
of
vaccinations.
”
Public
health
experts
have
repeatedly
emphasized
that
the
clotting
disorder
is
rare
and
that
the
benefits
of
the
AstraZeneca
and
Johnson
&
Johnson
vaccines
far
outweigh
their
risks
.
But
when
an
adverse
effect
has
the
potential
to
be
devastating
or
fatal
—
like
blood
clots
in
the
brain
—
some
regulators
and
segments
of
the
public
consider
the
risk
unacceptable
,
even
if
it
is
extremely
rare.The
safety
bar
for
vaccines
is
set
high
because
they
are
given
to
healthy
people
.
The
seemingly
greater
vulnerability
of
younger
people
to
the
clotting
disorder
is
of
particular
concern
,
because
their
risk
of
severe
illness
from
Covid
itself
is
lower
than
that
in
older
people
.
Those
differences
suggest
that
over
all
,
compared
to
older
people
,
younger
people
may
have
less
to
gain
and
more
to
lose
from
the
Johnson
&
Johnson
and
AstraZeneca
vaccines.There
were
curious
characteristics
about
the
H1N1
influenza
pandemic
of
1977-78
,
which
emerged
from
northeastern
Asia
and
killed
an
estimated
700,000
people
around
the
world
.
For
one
,
it
almost
exclusively
affected
people
in
their
mid-20s
or
younger
.
Scientists
discovered
another
oddity
that
could
explain
the
first
:
It
was
virtually
identical
to
a
strain
that
circulated
in
the
1950s
.
People
born
before
that
had
immunity
that
protected
them
,
and
younger
people
didn
’
t.But
how
on
earth
had
it
remained
so
steady
genetically
,
since
viruses
continually
mutate
?
Scientists
guessed
that
it
had
been
frozen
in
a
lab
.
It
was
often
found
to
be
sensitive
to
temperature
,
something
expected
for
viruses
used
in
vaccine
research.It
was
only
in
2004
that
a
prominent
virologist
,
Peter
Palese
,
wrote
that
Chi-Ming
Chu
,
a
respected
virologist
and
a
former
member
of
the
Chinese
Academy
of
Sciences
,
told
him
that
“
the
introduction
of
this
1977
H1N1
virus
”
was
indeed
thought
to
be
due
to
vaccine
trials
involving
“
the
challenge
of
several
thousand
military
recruits
with
live
H1N1
virus.
”
For
the
first
time
,
science
itself
seemed
to
have
caused
a
pandemic
while
trying
to
prepare
for
it.Now
,
for
the
second
time
in
50
years
,
there
are
questions
about
whether
we
are
dealing
with
a
pandemic
caused
by
scientific
research.While
the
Chinese
government
’
s
obstruction
may
keep
us
from
knowing
for
sure
whether
the
virus
,
SARS-CoV-2
,
came
from
the
wild
directly
or
through
a
lab
in
Wuhan
or
if
genetic
experimentation
was
involved
,
what
we
know
already
is
troubling.Years
of
research
on
the
dangers
of
coronaviruses
,
and
the
broader
history
of
lab
accidents
and
errors
around
the
world
,
provided
scientists
with
plenty
of
reasons
to
proceed
with
caution
as
they
investigated
this
class
of
pathogens
.
But
troubling
safety
practices
persisted.Worse
,
researchers
’
success
at
uncovering
new
threats
did
not
always
translate
into
preparedness.Even
if
the
coronavirus
jumped
from
animal
to
human
without
the
involvement
of
research
activities
,
the
groundwork
for
a
potential
disaster
had
been
laid
for
years
,
and
learning
its
lessons
is
essential
to
preventing
others.Until
the
SARS
outbreak
,
coronaviruses
were
considered
fairly
benign
,
causing
only
minor
to
moderate
colds
.
Even
five
months
after
SARS
emerged
in
southern
China
in
November
2002
,
the
Chinese
government
was
covering
up
details
about
its
threat
,
while
the
disease
was
spreading
to
other
countries
.
By
summer
2003
,
it
had
been
contained
,
but
not
before
infecting
over
8,000
people
and
killing
774
.
Officials
were
able
to
suppress
SARS
because
infected
people
spread
it
when
visibly
sick
,
making
it
easier
to
identify
and
isolate
people
.
But
it
was
a
close
call
,
and
that
roughly
10
percent
case
fatality
rate
raised
alarms
.
Preventing
the
next
coronavirus
pandemic
became
a
scientific
priority.By
2005
,
researchers
—
including
Dr.
Shi
Zhengli
,
a
virologist
at
the
Wuhan
Institute
of
Virology
—
had
identified
horseshoe
bats
as
the
likely
primary
host
animal
from
which
SARS
had
emerged
.
In
the
years
that
followed
,
scientists
pursued
bat
coronaviruses
in
the
field
and
studied
them
in
the
lab.It
is
often
assumed
that
SARS
was
spread
to
humans
by
palm
civets
,
an
adorable
small
mammal
sometimes
sold
at
wildlife
markets
,
though
by
2008
,
it
was
suspected
that
bat
coronaviruses
could
directly
infect
human
lung
cells
without
needing
an
intermediary
animal
.
By
2013
,
Dr.
Shi
’
s
lab
experiments
showed
this
could
happen.Still
,
scientists
sometimes
worked
with
bats
,
bat
samples
and
bat
viruses
under
conditions
that
have
since
raised
eyebrows.It
is
in
the
nature
of
viruses
to
continually
mutate
,
with
random
accidents
altering
,
adding
or
removing
parts
of
its
genome
or
bits
of
genetic
code
being
exchanged
with
other
viruses
—
recombination
.
This
constant
trial
and
error
enables
the
emergence
of
features
that
can
allow
viruses
to
infect
a
new
species.In
order
to
anticipate
these
jumps
,
humans
have
tried
to
steer
this
process
.
In
what
is
sometimes
called
gain-of-function
research
,
they
genetically
manipulate
viruses
to
see
how
they
can
become
more
dangerous.In
an
article
in
Nature
Medicine
in
2015
,
researchers
from
two
of
the
major
coronavirus
laboratories
in
the
world
—
Dr.
Shi
;
Ralph
Baric
,
a
professor
at
the
University
of
North
Carolina
at
Chapel
Hill
;
and
others
—
wrote
that
they
had
bioengineered
a
coronavirus
.
The
work
was
carried
out
in
Dr.
Baric
’
s
laboratory
at
U.N.C
.
They
took
a
spike
protein
,
the
“
key
”
that
coronaviruses
use
to
unlock
and
infect
cells
,
from
a
horseshoe
bat
virus
and
combined
it
with
a
human
SARS
virus
adapted
for
mice
.
They
reported
that
this
“
chimeric
”
virus
could
infect
human
cells
,
suggesting
some
bat
viruses
may
be
“
capable
of
infecting
humans
without
mutation
or
adaptation.
”
This
was
the
second
time
since
Dr.
Shi
’
s
2013
experiments
that
a
SARS-like
bat
coronavirus
showed
the
ability
in
the
lab
to
directly
infect
human
airway
cells.This
kind
of
genetic
manipulation
had
already
raised
concerns
,
especially
after
laboratories
in
the
Netherlands
and
the
United
States
announced
in
2011
that
they
had
created
strains
of
flu
viruses
using
genetic
material
from
the
H5N1
influenza
A
virus
,
which
is
very
deadly
but
generally
can
’
t
yet
spread
among
people
.
These
new
strains
could
spread
by
air
among
ferrets
,
which
have
humanlike
lungs
.
The
uproar
had
been
immediate.In
defense
of
the
2015
coronavirus
experiment
by
Dr.
Shi
and
her
colleagues
,
Peter
Daszak
,
whose
organization
,
EcoHealth
Alliance
,
has
worked
closely
with
her
and
has
been
granted
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
in
the
last
decade
from
the
U.S.
government
,
said
the
findings
would
allow
scientists
to
focus
on
the
greatest
risk
because
it
would
“
move
this
virus
from
a
candidate
emerging
pathogen
to
a
clear
and
present
danger.
”
Others
were
more
worried
.
“
If
the
virus
escaped
,
nobody
could
predict
the
trajectory
,
”
said
Simon
Wain-Hobson
,
a
virologist
at
the
Pasteur
Institute
in
Paris.Recent
history
provided
plenty
of
reason
for
such
concern.Nearly
every
SARS
case
since
the
original
epidemic
has
been
due
to
lab
leaks
—
six
incidents
in
three
countries
,
including
twice
in
a
single
month
from
a
lab
in
Beijing
.
In
one
instance
,
the
mother
of
a
lab
worker
died.In
2007
,
foot-and-mouth
disease
,
which
can
devastate
livestock
and
caused
a
massive
crisis
in
Britain
in
2001
,
escaped
from
a
drainage
pipe
leak
at
an
English
lab
with
the
highest
biosafety
rating
,
BSL-4.Even
the
last
known
person
who
died
of
smallpox
was
someone
infected
because
of
a
lab
incident
in
Britain
in
1978.In
its
first
published
survey
of
the
reporting
systems
in
American
labs
working
with
dangerous
pathogens
,
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
in
2012
reported
11
laboratory-acquired
infections
across
six
years
,
often
in
BSL-3
labs
—
the
category
of
safety
reserved
for
pathogens
like
tuberculosis
.
In
each
instance
,
the
exposure
was
not
realized
or
reported
until
lab
workers
became
infected.In
January
2014
,
the
C.D.C
.
contaminated
a
benign
flu
virus
sample
with
deadly
A
(
H5N1
)
but
didn
’
t
discover
the
danger
until
months
later
.
And
in
June
2014
,
it
mistakenly
sent
improperly
deactivated
anthrax
bacteria
to
labs
,
potentially
exposing
at
least
62
C.D.C
.
employees
who
worked
with
the
samples
without
protective
gear
.
One
month
later
,
vials
of
live
smallpox
virus
were
found
in
a
storage
room
at
the
National
Institutes
of
Health.In
October
2014
,
after
that
string
of
high-profile
incidents
,
the
United
States
paused
its
funding
of
new
gain-of-function
research
,
with
few
exceptions
.
The
moratorium
was
lifted
in
2017.Far
more
serious
questions
about
scientific
safety
would
soon
arise.On
Dec.
30
,
2019
,
a
public
email
list
run
by
the
International
Society
for
Infectious
Diseases
warned
that
an
“
unexplained
pneumonia
”
had
appeared
in
Wuhan
,
China
,
and
reports
connected
the
first
cases
to
the
city
’
s
Huanan
seafood
market
.
On
Jan.
10
,
2020
,
a
Chinese
scientist
posted
the
genome
of
the
virus
—
soon
to
be
named
SARS-CoV-2
—
on
an
open
internet
depository
,
confirming
that
it
was
a
coronavirus
.
The
Chinese
government
denied
that
the
virus
was
spreading
among
humans
until
Jan.
19
,
2020
;
three
days
later
,
it
announced
a
complete
lockdown
of
Wuhan
,
a
city
of
11
million
people.About
a
week
after
the
lockdown
,
Chinese
scientists
published
a
paper
in
The
Lancet
medical
journal
that
identified
bats
as
the
likely
source
of
the
virus
.
The
authors
noted
that
the
outbreak
happened
during
local
bat
hibernation
season
and
“
no
bats
were
sold
or
found
at
the
Huanan
seafood
market
,
”
so
they
reasoned
that
it
may
have
been
transmitted
by
an
intermediary
animal.Outbreaks
can
occur
far
from
their
source
.
The
2002
SARS
outbreak
started
in
Guangdong
,
about
a
thousand
kilometers
from
the
caves
in
Yunnan
with
the
horseshoe
bats
from
which
SARS
is
believed
to
have
emerged
.
Masked
palm
civets
,
farmed
and
traded
across
China
,
often
in
cramped
,
unsanitary
conditions
making
them
prone
to
outbreaks
,
were
cited
as
the
vehicle
that
SARS
probably
used
to
travel
from
Yunnan
to
Guangdong
.
Since
SARS-CoV-2
was
first
detected
at
a
market
where
live
wild
animals
may
have
been
sold
,
the
wildlife
trade
was
immediately
suspected.Social
media
users
in
China
were
among
the
first
to
be
more
skeptical
.
Did
the
spread
of
a
disease
from
bats
just
happen
to
start
in
Wuhan
,
home
to
the
Wuhan
Institute
of
Virology
,
one
of
the
few
top
bat
coronavirus
research
facilities
in
the
world
?
And
what
about
the
Wuhan
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
,
which
also
carries
out
bat
research
,
a
few
hundred
yards
from
the
seafood
market
?
On
Feb.
19
,
2020
,
27
prominent
scientists
published
an
open
letter
in
The
Lancet
.
They
decried
“
conspiracy
theories
suggesting
that
Covid-19
does
not
have
a
natural
origin.
”
As
we
consider
its
origin
,
the
question
is
not
so
much
whether
SARS-CoV-2
could
have
gotten
out
of
a
lab
—
accidents
happen
—
but
whether
it
could
have
gotten
in
and
how
it
would
have
been
handled
there.Shortly
after
Wuhan
was
locked
down
in
January
2020
,
it
became
apparent
that
SARS-CoV-2
was
related
to
a
virus
that
scientists
had
been
aware
of
for
years.On
Feb.
3
,
2020
,
Dr.
Shi
and
co-authors
announced
in
Nature
that
they
had
found
a
virus
in
their
database
,
RaTG13
,
whose
genome
sequence
was
96.2
percent
identical
to
SARS-CoV-2
and
was
previously
detected
in
horseshoe
bats
of
Yunnan.Suspicious
internet
sleuths
combed
through
genomic
databases
and
found
that
RaTG13
was
an
exact
match
for
a
bat
coronavirus
called
4991
retrieved
from
a
cave
implicated
in
an
unexplained
outbreak
of
pneumonia
in
2012
among
miners
who
collected
bat
guano
from
a
mine
in
Yunnan
.
Three
of
the
six
miners
died.In
May
2020
,
a
former
science
teacher
from
India
,
with
the
Twitter
pseudonym
TheSeeker268
,
found
a
2013
master
’
s
thesis
,
as
well
as
a
2016
Ph.D.
thesis
,
supervised
by
George
Fu
Gao
,
the
current
director
of
the
Chinese
Center
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
.
The
master
’
s
thesis
hypothesized
that
the
miners
’
illness
was
caused
by
direct
transmission
of
a
SARS-like
coronavirus
from
a
horseshoe
bat
.
The
Ph.D.
thesis
was
more
cautious
but
still
called
the
outbreak
“
notable.
”
It
also
revealed
that
a
team
from
the
Wuhan
Institute
of
Virology
had
collected
bat
samples
from
the
cave
.
The
dissertation
noted
that
all
four
of
the
miners
who
were
tested
for
SARS
antibodies
had
them
in
their
blood
a
few
weeks
after
they
became
ill.None
of
those
crucial
facts
—
the
name
change
or
the
link
to
the
previous
fatal
outbreak
possibly
from
a
SARS-like
coronavirus
—
were
mentioned
in
the
original
paper
about
RaTG13
.
In
an
interview
published
in
March
2020
,
Dr.
Shi
said
fungus
was
the
pathogen
that
had
sickened
the
miners
,
not
a
coronavirus.The
questions
persisted.Last
July
,
Dr.
Shi
confirmed
that
RaTG13
was
indeed
4991
renamed
.
In
November
2020
,
her
paper
in
Nature
was
finally
updated
,
additionally
acknowledging
what
sleuths
had
also
uncovered
:
Her
team
genetically
sequenced
RaTG13
in
2018
.
(
The
possible
bat
coronavirus
link
to
the
miner
deaths
was
still
not
acknowledged
.
)
The
less
than
forthcoming
disclosure
—
a
virus
with
two
names
,
the
connection
to
a
deadly
outbreak
,
shifting
diseases
and
inconsistent
stories
—
fueled
suspicions.Some
speculated
whether
RaTG13
had
been
subjected
to
gain-of-function-type
manipulation
to
create
SARS-CoV-2
.
But
RaTG13
is
more
like
a
distant
cousin
of
SARS-CoV-2
,
meaning
it
is
unlikely
to
have
produced
SARS-CoV-2
as
an
offspring
,
either
through
recent
evolution
in
the
wild
or
manipulation
in
the
lab.Even
if
RaTG13
had
no
role
in
the
Covid-19
outbreak
,
questions
were
raised
about
why
Dr.
Shi
and
others
seemed
so
unforthcoming
about
it
.
Then
more
questions
were
raised.For
example
,
the
same
group
of
internet
sleuths
that
linked
RaTG13
to
the
mine
also
uncovered
that
a
genomic
database
maintained
by
the
Wuhan
Institute
of
Virology
,
with
information
about
thousands
of
bat
samples
and
at
least
500
recently
discovered
bat
coronaviruses
,
went
offline
in
September
2019
.
The
official
explanation
—
that
it
was
taken
offline
because
it
had
been
subjected
to
hacking
—
doesn
’
t
explain
why
it
was
never
securely
shared
some
other
way
with
responsible
independent
researchers.Such
gaps
made
it
harder
to
rule
out
worrying
scenarios
.
If
there
had
been
a
lab
accident
involving
SARS-CoV-2
or
a
virus
like
it
that
had
been
collected
in
the
wild
or
experimented
on
in
the
lab
,
the
database
might
have
been
taken
down
so
there
would
be
less
evidence
that
might
help
others
connect
the
dots
.
Officials
might
have
investigated
possible
lab
cases
and
prematurely
believed
it
was
in
the
clear
.
However
,
cases
can
be
asymptomatic
,
and
they
might
have
missed
the
one
that
started
a
transmission
chain
and
allowed
the
virus
to
circulate
quietly
until
a
superspreader
event
in
December.The
secrecy
and
the
cover-ups
have
led
to
some
frantic
theories
—
for
example
,
that
the
virus
leaked
from
a
bioweapons
lab
,
which
makes
little
sense
,
since
,
for
one
thing
,
bioweapons
usually
involve
more
lethal
pathogens
with
a
known
cure
or
vaccine
,
to
protect
those
who
employ
them.But
much
more
mundane
threats
lurked.Dr
.
Shi
’
s
scientific
work
was
dependent
on
collecting
and
analyzing
hundreds
of
bat
samples
.
And
it
was
her
work
that
showed
the
dangers
associated
with
this
endeavor
.
The
2013
paper
by
Dr.
Shi
,
Dr.
Daszak
and
others
demonstrated
that
a
live
bat
coronavirus
from
a
Yunnan
sample
could
bind
to
human
lung
cell
receptors
,
showing
that
“
intermediate
hosts
may
not
be
necessary
for
direct
human
infection.
”
That
controversial
2015
experiment
co-authored
by
a
group
of
researchers
that
included
Dr.
Baric
and
Dr.
Shi
was
carried
out
after
they
had
found
another
bat
coronavirus
they
suspected
could
infect
humans
,
but
it
was
difficult
to
cultivate
.
They
then
created
that
chimeric
one
using
its
spike
.
They
showed
that
it
,
too
,
could
infect
human
airway
cells
directly.In
October
2015
,
Dr.
Shi
’
s
lab
sampled
over
200
people
living
within
a
few
miles
of
two
Yunnan
bat
caves
and
found
that
six
tested
positive
for
bat
coronavirus
antibodies
,
indicating
past
infection
.
All
six
reported
having
seen
bats
and
only
20
people
in
total
had
reported
seeing
bats
flying
close
to
their
homes
,
suggesting
exposure
created
a
great
risk
of
infection.The
research
practices
,
however
,
may
not
have
always
incorporated
these
lessons.While
a
2017
Chinese
article
noted
the
caution
of
the
Wuhan
Institute
of
Virology
’
s
workers
and
showed
them
hooded
and
some
wearing
N95
masks
,
later
that
year
a
Chinese
state-TV
story
about
Dr.
Shi
’
s
studies
showed
researchers
handling
bats
or
bat
feces
with
their
bare
hands
or
with
exposed
arms
.
A
person
on
her
team
likened
a
bat
bite
to
“
being
jabbed
with
a
needle.
”
In
a
2018
blog
post
that
was
later
removed
,
Dr.
Shi
said
that
the
job
was
“
not
as
dangerous
”
as
everyone
thought
.
“
The
chance
of
directly
infecting
humans
is
very
small
,
”
she
wrote
.
“
In
most
cases
only
ordinary
protection
will
be
taken
,
”
unless
a
bat
was
known
to
carry
a
virus
that
might
infect
humans
.
She
repeated
something
similar
in
a
2018
TED
Talk-style
video
,
according
to
The
Washington
Post
,
noting
that
“
simpler
protection
”
—
illustrated
with
slides
of
unmasked
or
surgically
masked
colleagues
with
bare
hands
—
was
appropriate
because
it
was
believed
that
bat
pathogens
usually
required
an
intermediate
host.Dr
.
Shi
said
that
all
the
research
at
the
institute
is
done
in
strict
accordance
with
biosafety
standards
and
the
lab
is
tested
annually
by
a
third-party
institution.The
Wuhan
C.D.C
.
also
reportedly
conducts
research
on
bat-borne
viruses.One
of
its
staff
members
,
Tian
Junhua
,
has
developed
a
reputation
for
adventurous
scientific
discovery
.
A
2013
paper
notes
his
team
caught
155
bats
in
Hubei
Province
.
The
Washington
Post
reported
that
in
a
video
released
on
Dec.
10
,
2019
,
he
boasted
about
“
having
visited
dozens
of
bat
caves
and
studied
300
types
of
virus
vectors.
”
Previously
,
he
also
talked
about
having
made
mistakes
in
the
field
,
like
forgetting
personal
protective
equipment
and
being
splashed
with
bat
urine
or
accidentally
getting
bat
blood
on
his
skin
,
according
to
The
Post
.
And
yet
the
World
Health
Organization
reported
that
the
agency
denied
ever
storing
or
working
with
bat
viruses
in
the
lab
before
the
pandemic.This
March
the
W.H.O
.
reported
that
the
Wuhan
C.D.C
.
lab
“
moved
on
2nd
December
2019
to
a
new
location
near
the
Huanan
market.
”
The
W.H.O
.
report
said
there
were
“
no
disruptions
or
incidents
”
during
the
move
.
Given
the
Chinese
government
’
s
lack
of
candor
,
that
raises
suspicions
that
lab
samples
,
if
not
bats
themselves
,
were
being
hauled
around
near
the
market
at
the
time
of
the
outbreak.Many
of
these
research
practices
weren
’
t
deviations
from
international
norms
.
A
bat
field
researcher
in
the
United
States
told
me
she
now
always
wears
a
respirator
in
bat
caves
but
that
wasn
’
t
standard
practice
before.It
isn
’
t
a
wild
idea
to
suggest
that
field
research
risks
setting
off
an
outbreak
.
Dr.
Linfa
Wang
,
a
Chinese-Australian
virologist
based
in
Singapore
who
frequently
works
with
Dr.
Shi
and
pioneered
the
hypothesis
that
bats
were
behind
the
2003
SARS
epidemic
,
told
Nature
there
is
a
small
chance
that
this
pandemic
was
seeded
by
a
researcher
inadvertently
getting
infected
by
an
unknown
virus
while
collecting
bat
samples
in
a
cave.Bats
could
create
further
risks
if
housed
in
laboratories
,
like
the
risk
posed
by
the
sale
of
wildlife
in
urban
markets.On
Dec.
10
,
Peter
Daszak
,
who
organized
The
Lancet
letter
denouncing
the
questioning
of
Covid-19
’
s
natural
origins
and
was
announced
as
a
member
of
the
W.H.O
.
origins
investigation
committee
last
fall
,
insisted
it
was
a
conspiracy
theory
to
suggest
that
there
were
live
bats
in
labs
he
had
collaborated
with
for
15
years
.
“
That
’
s
not
how
this
science
works
,
”
he
wrote
in
a
tweet
he
later
deleted
.
“
We
collect
bat
samples
,
send
them
to
the
lab
.
We
RELEASE
bats
where
we
catch
them
!
”
But
evidence
to
the
contrary
has
accumulated
.
An
assistant
researcher
told
a
reporter
that
Dr.
Shi
took
on
the
role
of
feeding
the
bats
when
students
were
away
.
Another
news
report
in
2018
said
a
team
led
by
one
of
her
doctoral
trainees
“
collected
a
full
rack
of
swabs
and
bagged
a
dozen
live
bats
for
further
testing
back
at
the
lab.
”
The
Chinese
Academy
of
Sciences
website
has
listed
the
Wuhan
institute
as
having
at
least
a
dozen
cages
for
bats
,
and
in
2018
the
institute
applied
for
a
patent
for
a
bat
cage
.
Dr.
Shi
has
talked
about
monitoring
antibodies
in
bats
over
time
—
which
would
not
be
done
in
a
cave
.
Recently
,
another
video
surfaced
that
reportedly
showed
live
bats
in
the
institute.Just
a
few
weeks
ago
,
Dr.
Daszak
changed
his
claims
.
“
I
wouldn
’
t
be
surprised
if
,
”
he
said
,
“
like
many
other
virology
labs
,
they
were
trying
to
set
up
a
bat
colony.
”
Meanwhile
,
no
intermediary
animal
has
yet
been
found
,
despite
testing
thousands
of
animals
around
Wuhan
.
Last
month
a
former
commissioner
of
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
,
Scott
Gottlieb
,
said
this
failure
added
to
the
evidence
of
a
lab
leak
,
although
Dr.
Daszak
suggested
that
investigators
look
further
,
at
wildlife
farms
in
southern
China.But
if
bat-to-human
transmission
is
how
the
spillover
happened
,
no
intermediary
animal
is
necessary
,
since
it
could
have
been
any
interaction
with
a
bat
—
by
a
villager
or
a
field
researcher.Despite
widespread
assertions
that
bat
viruses
need
an
intermediary
animal
to
spread
to
humans
,
research
is
not
even
settled
on
whether
the
palm
civet
spread
SARS
to
humans
from
bats
.
We
do
know
that
palm
civets
amplified
the
outbreak
once
SARS
arrived
in
the
Guangdong
market
and
that
back-and-forth
transmission
between
humans
and
civets
was
possible
.
However
,
the
only
widespread
infected
civet
populations
that
researchers
found
were
those
at
urban
markets
and
sometimes
at
farms
—
where
people
are
—
and
not
in
the
wild
.
We
know
we
can
infect
animals
.
Last
year
Denmark
had
to
kill
17
million
minks
after
they
caught
SARS-CoV-2
from
people
.
It
’
s
possible
that
humans
were
the
initial
intermediary
animal
for
civets
and
that
the
cute
little
creatures
were
framed.Other
sources
of
risk
were
the
lab
activities
themselves.There
has
been
a
lot
of
speculation
that
SARS-CoV-2
was
the
result
of
genetic
engineering
.
This
hypothesis
can
not
be
ruled
out
based
on
genomic
analysis
alone
,
and
suspicion
has
grown
because
of
the
opaque
response
by
Chinese
authorities.They
have
refused
to
share
direct
records
from
the
lab
.
Dr.
Shi
echoed
this
stance
in
May
when
a
group
of
scientists
,
including
her
co-author
Dr.
Baric
,
pushed
for
broader
transparency
.
“
It
’
s
definitely
not
acceptable
,
”
she
emailed
a
reporter
in
response
to
the
group
’
s
request
to
see
her
lab
’
s
records.Meanwhile
,
throughout
December
2019
,
Wuhan
doctors
suspected
that
a
SARS-like
virus
was
on
the
loose
,
and
the
local
government
arrested
whistle-blowers
,
including
at
least
one
health
care
worker
.
The
cover-up
by
Communist
Party
officials
continued
until
the
prominent
SARS
scientist
Zhong
Nanshan
traveled
to
Wuhan
on
Jan.
18
and
raised
the
alarm.That
said
,
circumstantial
evidence
casts
some
doubt
on
the
claim
that
SARS-CoV-2
was
bioengineered.For
instance
,
aspects
of
the
virus
that
have
made
some
suspect
it
was
bioengineered
could
also
be
evidence
that
the
virus
evolved
naturally
.
A
lot
of
attention
has
been
drawn
to
an
unusual
feature
on
its
spike
protein
called
a
furin
cleavage
site
,
with
which
the
virus
can
better
infect
a
human
cell
.
It
’
s
one
of
several
odd
features
of
SARS-CoV-2
that
are
weird
enough
that
even
virologists
who
greatly
doubt
lab
involvement
told
me
they
were
shocked
to
see
it
.
In
fact
,
even
beyond
the
furin
cleavage
site
,
SARS-CoV-2
was
a
virus
that
scientists
had
never
seen
before
.
Evolution
can
be
a
random
accumulation
of
weird
,
novel
features
.
For
the
research
on
viruses
that
scientists
like
Dr.
Shi
do
for
high-level
scientific
publications
,
such
a
combination
would
be
incongruous
.
Their
work
usually
involves
examining
or
changing
one
element
of
a
virus
at
a
time
to
find
out
what
each
element
does
and
can
be
made
to
do
.
If
your
computer
conked
out
,
for
instance
,
you
wouldn
’
t
see
what
’
s
wrong
by
simultaneously
changing
the
power
source
,
the
cable
and
the
electrical
outlet
.
You
’
d
test
each
one
individually
.
Having
a
variety
of
unusual
elements
leads
to
hard-to-assess
results
,
not
a
paper
in
Nature.But
even
if
we
put
aside
directed
engineering
,
regular
lab
work
at
the
Wuhan
labs
has
raised
concerns.In
2016
the
Wuhan
institute
reported
experimenting
on
a
live
bat
coronavirus
that
could
infect
human
cells
in
a
BSL-2
lab
—
a
biosafety
level
that
has
been
compared
with
that
of
a
dentist
’
s
office
.
Protective
gear
other
than
gloves
and
lab
coats
is
usually
optional
at
this
level
,
and
there
’
s
often
no
airflow
control
sealing
ventilation
between
the
work
area
and
the
rest
of
the
building
.
Michael
Lin
,
an
associate
professor
of
neurobiology
and
bioengineering
at
Stanford
,
told
me
it
was
“
an
actual
scandal
,
recorded
in
print
,
”
that
a
SARS-like
virus
capable
of
replicating
in
human
cells
was
worked
on
under
such
low
safety
conditions.Just
trying
to
culture
bat
viruses
in
the
lab
can
create
risks
that
the
scientists
may
not
even
be
aware
of
.
While
trying
and
failing
to
cultivate
one
strain
,
they
might
inadvertently
culture
another
one
they
don
’
t
even
know
about
.
It
’
s
even
possible
,
Dr.
Lin
told
me
,
that
viruses
can
coexist
in
a
single
sample
and
quietly
recombine
,
giving
rise
to
something
novel
but
undetected
.
Under
BSL-2
conditions
or
even
sloppy
BSL-3
conditions
,
researchers
could
get
exposed
to
a
pathogen
they
didn
’
t
know
existed.Several
scientists
who
signed
The
Lancet
letter
denouncing
the
consideration
of
anything
but
natural
origins
have
since
said
they
are
more
open
to
lab
involvement
.
One
,
Bernard
Roizman
,
an
emeritus
virologist
at
the
University
of
Chicago
with
four
honorary
professorships
from
Chinese
universities
,
said
he
was
leaning
toward
believing
there
was
a
lab
accident.
“
I
’
m
convinced
that
what
happened
is
that
the
virus
was
brought
to
a
lab
,
they
started
to
work
with
it
,
”
he
told
The
Wall
Street
Journal
,
“
and
some
sloppy
individual
brought
it
out.
”
He
added
,
“
They
can
’
t
admit
they
did
something
so
stupid.
”
Charles
Calisher
of
Colorado
State
University
,
another
signatory
,
recently
told
ABC
News
that
“
there
is
too
much
coincidence
”
to
ignore
the
lab-leak
theory
and
he
now
believes
“
it
is
more
likely
that
it
came
out
of
that
lab.
”
Peter
Palese
,
the
virologist
who
wrote
about
the
1977
flu
pandemic
,
said
that
“
a
lot
of
disturbing
information
has
surfaced
since
The
Lancet
letter
I
signed
”
and
that
he
wants
an
investigation
to
come
up
with
answers.Other
scientists
have
also
said
they
have
changed
their
minds
.
Ian
Lipkin
,
the
director
of
the
Center
for
Infection
and
Immunity
at
Columbia
University
and
a
co-author
of
an
influential
article
in
Nature
Medicine
that
argued
in
favor
of
a
natural
origin
in
March
2020
,
is
also
now
more
skeptical
.
“
People
should
not
be
looking
at
bat
viruses
in
BSL-2
labs
,
”
he
told
the
science
reporter
Donald
G.
McNeil
Jr.
last
month
.
“
My
view
has
changed.
”
Medical
records
of
lab
workers
could
help
clarify
such
questions
.
Last
July
,
Dr.
Shi
said
“
a
possibility
did
not
exist
”
that
anyone
associated
with
the
institute
may
have
gotten
infected
“
while
collecting
,
sampling
or
handling
bats.
”
She
added
that
it
had
recently
tested
all
institute
staff
members
and
students
for
antibodies
showing
past
infection
by
SARS-CoV-2
or
SARS-related
viruses
and
had
found
“
zero
infection
”
and
insisted
that
she
could
rule
out
this
possibility
for
all
labs
in
Wuhan.It
’
s
hard
to
see
how
a
careful
scientist
could
dismiss
even
the
slightest
possibility
for
all
labs
,
including
those
not
her
own
.
“
Zero
infection
”
would
mean
not
a
single
case
among
the
hundreds
of
people
at
the
institute
,
even
though
a
study
found
that
4.4
percent
of
the
Wuhan
population
had
been
infected.Later
,
the
W.H.O
.
team
asked
for
more
information
about
the
earliest
Covid-19
cases
in
Wuhan
,
including
anonymized
but
detailed
patient
data
—
something
that
should
be
standard
in
any
outbreak
origin
investigation
—
and
were
denied
access.All
this
leaves
a
lot
of
possibilities
open
and
a
lot
of
confusion.Since
most
pandemics
have
been
due
to
zoonotic
events
,
emerging
from
animals
,
is
there
reason
to
doubt
lab
involvement
?
Maybe
if
you
look
at
all
of
human
history
.
A
better
period
of
comparison
is
the
time
since
the
advent
of
molecular
biology
,
when
it
became
more
likely
for
scientists
to
cause
outbreaks
.
The
1977
pandemic
was
tied
to
research
activities
,
while
the
other
two
pandemics
that
have
occurred
since
then
,
AIDS
and
the
H1N1
swine
flu
of
2009
,
were
not.Plus
,
once
a
rare
event
,
like
a
pandemic
,
has
happened
,
one
has
to
consider
all
the
potential
paths
to
it
.
It
’
s
like
investigating
a
plane
crash
.
Flying
is
usually
very
safe
,
but
when
a
crash
does
happen
,
we
don
’
t
just
say
mechanical
errors
and
pilot
mistakes
don
’
t
usually
lead
to
catastrophes
and
that
terrorism
is
rare
.
Rather
,
we
investigate
all
possible
paths
,
including
unusual
ones
,
so
we
can
figure
out
how
to
prevent
similar
events.Perhaps
the
biggest
question
has
been
what
to
read
into
the
location
of
the
outbreak
,
a
thousand
miles
from
the
closest
known
viral
relatives
yet
close
to
a
leading
research
institution.Sometimes
the
curiosity
around
the
location
has
been
waved
away
with
the
explanation
that
labs
are
set
up
where
viruses
are
.
However
,
the
Wuhan
Institute
of
Virology
has
been
where
it
is
since
1956
,
doing
research
on
agricultural
and
environmental
microbiology
under
a
different
name
.
It
was
upgraded
and
began
to
focus
on
coronavirus
research
only
after
SARS
.
Wuhan
is
a
metropolis
with
a
larger
population
than
New
York
City
’
s
,
not
some
rural
outpost
near
bat
caves
.
Dr.
Shi
said
the
December
2019
outbreak
surprised
her
because
she
“
never
expected
this
kind
of
thing
to
happen
in
Wuhan
,
in
central
China.
”
When
her
lab
needed
a
population
with
a
lower
likelihood
of
bat
coronavirus
exposure
,
they
used
Wuhan
residents
,
noting
that
“
inhabitants
have
a
much
lower
likelihood
of
contact
with
bats
due
to
its
urban
setting.
”
Still
,
location
itself
is
not
proof
,
either
.
Plausible
scenarios
implicating
research
activities
don
’
t
rule
out
other
options.This
week
,
Jesse
Bloom
,
an
associate
professor
at
the
Fred
Hutchinson
Cancer
Research
Center
,
told
me
that
when
he
recovered
and
analyzed
a
set
of
partial
early
Wuhan
genetic
sequences
that
had
been
removed
from
a
genomic
archive
,
it
supported
“
substantial
existing
evidence
that
SARS-CoV-2
was
circulating
in
Wuhan
prior
to
the
seafood
market
outbreak.
”
Both
the
early
reports
from
Chinese
scientists
and
the
more
recent
W.H.O
.
investigation
this
winter
found
many
of
the
early
cases
had
no
connection
to
the
seafood
market
,
including
the
earliest
acknowledged
case
so
far
,
on
Dec.
8
,
2019
.
So
the
seafood
market
may
not
have
been
the
original
location
of
the
outbreak.It
’
s
also
plausible
that
an
outbreak
could
have
started
someplace
else
and
was
detected
in
Wuhan
simply
because
it
was
a
big
city
.
Testing
blood
banks
from
across
China
,
especially
in
areas
near
wildlife
farms
and
bat
caves
,
would
help
,
but
with
limited
exceptions
,
the
Chinese
government
has
not
carried
out
such
research
—
or
allowed
the
sharing
of
the
results
if
it
has.With
so
much
evidence
withheld
,
it
’
s
hard
to
say
anything
about
Covid-19
’
s
origins
with
certainty
,
and
even
a
genuine
investigation
would
face
challenges
.
Some
outbreaks
have
never
been
traced
to
their
origin.But
even
if
we
are
denied
answers
,
we
can
still
learn
lessons.Perhaps
the
biggest
one
is
that
we
were
due
for
a
bat
coronavirus
outbreak
,
one
way
or
another
,
and
the
research
showing
bat
coronaviruses
’
ability
to
jump
to
humans
was
a
warning
not
heeded.Scientists
and
government
officials
need
to
weigh
the
benefits
and
dangers
of
how
we
work
with
bats
and
viruses
,
in
the
field
and
the
lab
,
especially
since
other
public
health
investments
may
do
much
more
to
prevent
a
pandemic
.
It
might
be
more
effective
to
institute
rigorous
surveillance
where
threatening
pathogens
are
known
to
thrive
,
and
better
prepare
our
institutions
to
react
quickly
and
transparently
to
the
first
sign
of
an
outbreak
.
Research
can
be
weighted
toward
response
rather
than
prediction
;
these
overlap
but
aren
’
t
identical
.
Finding
a
dangerous
virus
in
a
cave
or
a
petri
dish
might
be
useful
,
but
it
’
s
a
bit
like
poking
a
bear
we
are
trying
to
avoid.Field
research
on
bats
should
have
been
done
more
carefully
.
Bat
viruses
should
not
be
studied
in
BSL-2
labs
,
and
research
in
BSL-3
labs
should
be
done
only
under
the
strictest
caution
.
Bats
should
be
treated
as
a
serious
threat
in
labs
.
Human
interactions
with
bats
should
occur
under
strict
regulation
and
surveillance.Alison
Young
,
an
investigative
reporter
who
has
long
covered
lab
incidents
,
wrote
that
from
2015
to
2019
,
there
were
more
than
450
reported
accidents
with
pathogens
that
the
federal
government
regulates
because
of
their
danger
.
Comparable
rates
of
incidents
were
found
in
British
labs
—
and
research
suggests
lab
accidents
are
not
even
always
reported.Some
scientists
have
proposed
imposing
stricter
controls
and
a
stronger
risk-benefit
analysis
for
research
on
pathogens
that
could
inadvertently
spark
pandemics
.
Some
research
may
still
be
worth
it
,
and
there
have
been
proposals
to
move
such
labs
outside
densely
populated
cities.Cooperation
with
China
on
these
issues
is
vital
,
including
on
lab
safety
and
outbreak
surveillance
.
Some
argue
that
criticizing
China
’
s
response
to
the
pandemic
and
the
scientific
practices
that
might
have
led
to
it
will
imperil
that
cooperation
.
It
’
s
hard
to
see
how
angry
op-eds
could
make
Chinese
officials
more
intransigent
than
they
already
are.People
are
understandably
wary
that
these
claims
might
demonize
scientists
from
other
countries
,
especially
given
the
anti-Asian
racism
that
has
abounded
.
But
why
would
perpetuating
this
state
of
events
be
to
their
benefit
?
After
a
lab
accident
with
anthrax
bacteria
in
the
Soviet
Union
in
1979
that
killed
dozens
,
leading
Western
scientists
accepted
the
Soviet
government
’
s
excuses
,
which
all
turned
out
to
be
lies
.
That
doesn
’
t
help
lead
to
better
safety
standards
,
including
those
that
would
benefit
scientists
in
authoritarian
countries.But
a
better
path
forward
is
one
of
true
global
cooperation
based
on
mutual
benefit
and
reciprocity
.
Despite
the
current
dissembling
,
we
should
assume
that
the
Chinese
government
also
doesn
’
t
want
to
go
through
this
again
—
especially
given
that
SARS
,
too
,
started
there.This
means
putting
the
public
interest
before
personal
ambitions
and
acknowledging
that
despite
the
wonders
of
its
power
,
biomedical
research
also
holds
dangers.To
do
this
,
government
officials
and
scientists
need
to
look
at
the
big
picture
:
Seek
comity
and
truth
instead
of
just
avoiding
embarrassment
.
Develop
a
framework
that
goes
beyond
blaming
China
,
since
the
issues
raised
are
truly
global
.
And
realize
that
the
next
big
thing
can
simply
mean
taking
great
care
with
a
lot
of
small
details.When
did
the
coronavirus
arrive
in
the
United
States
?
The
first
infection
was
confirmed
on
Jan.
21
,
2020
,
in
a
resident
of
Washington
State
who
had
recently
returned
from
Wuhan
,
China
.
Soon
after
,
experts
concluded
that
the
virus
had
been
in
the
country
for
weeks.A
study
published
on
Tuesday
offers
new
evidence
:
Based
on
an
analysis
of
blood
tests
,
scientists
identified
seven
people
in
five
states
who
may
have
been
infected
well
before
the
first
confirmed
cases
in
those
states
.
The
results
suggest
that
the
virus
may
have
been
circulating
in
Illinois
,
for
example
,
as
early
as
Dec.
24
,
2019
,
although
the
first
case
in
that
state
was
confirmed
a
month
later.But
the
new
study
is
flawed
,
some
experts
said
:
It
did
not
adequately
address
the
possibility
that
the
antibodies
were
to
coronaviruses
that
cause
common
colds
,
and
the
results
could
be
a
quirk
of
the
tests
used
.
In
addition
,
the
researchers
also
did
not
have
travel
information
for
any
of
the
patients
,
which
might
have
helped
explain
the
test
results.
“
This
is
an
interesting
paper
because
it
raises
the
idea
that
everyone
thinks
is
true
,
that
there
were
infections
that
were
going
undiagnosed
,
”
said
Scott
Hensley
,
an
immunologist
at
the
University
of
Pennsylvania.But
the
small
number
of
samples
that
tested
positive
made
it
difficult
to
be
sure
that
they
were
true
cases
of
infection
and
not
just
a
methodological
error
.
“
It
’
s
hard
to
know
what
is
a
real
signal
and
what
isn
’
t
,
”
he
said.If
the
findings
are
accurate
,
however
,
then
they
underscore
the
notion
that
poor
testing
in
the
United
States
missed
most
cases
during
the
early
weeks
of
the
pandemic.
“
Without
testing
,
you
can
’
t
see
what
’
s
going
on
,
”
said
Keri
Althoff
,
an
epidemiologist
at
the
Johns
Hopkins
Bloomberg
School
of
Public
Health
and
lead
author
of
the
study
.
“
In
these
earlier
months
in
some
of
these
states
where
we
were
not
suspecting
,
there
was
a
lot
of
infection
going
on
there.
”
It
is
not
a
surprise
that
there
may
have
been
undocumented
cases
early
in
the
pandemic
,
said
Sarah
Cobey
,
an
evolutionary
biologist
at
the
University
of
Chicago
.
Experts
“
already
knew
that
was
the
case
from
studying
trends
in
excess
mortality
and
hospitalizations
,
”
she
said.Dr
.
Cobey
’
s
most
recent
model
estimated
that
there
were
roughly
10,000
infections
in
Illinois
on
March
1
,
2020
.
“
Given
the
horrible
state
of
testing
,
there
was
never
any
doubt
we
were
missing
most
early
transmission
,
”
she
added.In
the
study
,
published
in
the
journal
Clinical
Infectious
Diseases
,
Dr.
Althoff
and
her
colleagues
analyzed
blood
samples
from
more
than
24,000
people
.
They
found
nine
people
who
had
donated
blood
between
Jan.
2
and
March
18
of
last
year
who
appeared
to
have
antibodies
to
the
coronavirus.Seven
of
the
samples
came
from
blood
donated
before
the
date
of
the
first
diagnosis
in
their
states
—
Illinois
,
Wisconsin
,
Pennsylvania
,
Mississippi
and
Massachusetts
.
The
results
are
consistent
with
those
of
another
study
that
identified
coronavirus
antibodies
in
blood
donated
as
early
as
mid-December
2019.The
participants
were
enrolled
in
a
long-term
National
Institutes
of
Health
project
,
called
All
of
Us
,
that
aims
to
include
a
million
people
in
the
United
States
in
order
to
increase
the
representation
of
minorities
in
research
.
Only
about
half
of
the
people
in
the
study
were
white.Early
in
the
pandemic
,
the
virus
would
have
infected
very
few
people
.
A
low
prevalence
increases
the
odds
that
an
antibody
test
mistakenly
identifies
a
sample
as
having
antibodies
when
it
does
not
,
Dr.
Hensley
said
—
a
false
positive.The
researchers
tried
to
minimize
that
possibility
by
using
two
antibody
tests
in
sequence
.
The
first
test
flagged
147
samples
as
possibly
having
antibodies
to
the
coronavirus
;
the
second
slashed
that
number
down
to
nine.The
team
also
analyzed
1,000
samples
of
blood
from
the
2018-19
cold
and
flu
season
,
and
found
none
that
tested
positive
for
antibodies
to
the
coronavirus.
“
It
’
s
still
very
possible
that
some
of
them
might
be
false
positives
,
”
said
Dr.
Josh
Denny
,
chief
executive
of
All
of
Us
.
But
“
the
fact
that
all
of
them
would
be
false
positives
seems
pretty
unlikely
with
what
we
’
ve
done.
”
The
researchers
said
they
planned
to
contact
the
participants
to
ask
about
travel
history
and
would
continue
to
analyze
additional
samples
to
estimate
when
the
coronavirus
reached
American
shores.
“
The
exact
month
at
which
it
probably
came
into
the
U.S.
is
still
unknown
,
”
Dr.
Althoff
said
.
“
It
’
s
essentially
a
puzzle
right
now
,
and
our
study
is
just
one
piece
of
that
puzzle.
”
The
most
widely
used
coronavirus
vaccines
are
designed
as
two-shot
inoculations
,
and
nearly
everyone
worldwide
who
has
had
both
doses
has
received
the
same
vaccine
both
times.But
that
is
changing
,
as
more
countries
are
allowing
—
and
even
,
in
some
cases
,
encouraging
—
mix-and-match
inoculation
,
with
people
receiving
a
first
shot
of
one
vaccine
,
and
then
a
second
shot
of
a
different
one
.
On
Tuesday
,
Germany
’
s
government
revealed
that
Chancellor
Angela
Merkel
had
received
two
different
shots
,
adding
to
the
growing
interest
in
the
practice.Some
nations
have
tried
that
approach
out
of
necessity
,
when
supplies
of
a
particular
vaccine
ran
short
;
or
out
of
caution
,
when
questions
were
raised
about
the
safety
of
a
shot
after
some
people
had
already
received
their
first
doses
.
U.S.
regulators
so
far
have
been
reluctant
to
encourage
the
practice.But
scientists
and
health
policymakers
are
interested
in
the
possibility
that
giving
different
shots
to
the
same
person
could
have
significant
advantages.Here
are
some
common
questions
raised
by
mix-and-match
vaccination.Mixing
vaccines
—
scientists
call
it
“
heterologous
prime-boost
”
—
is
not
a
new
idea
,
and
researchers
have
experimented
with
it
in
fighting
a
handful
of
other
diseases
,
like
Ebola.Scientists
have
long
theorized
that
giving
people
two
slightly
different
vaccines
might
generate
a
stronger
immune
response
,
perhaps
because
the
vaccines
stimulate
slightly
different
parts
of
the
immune
system
or
teach
it
to
recognize
different
parts
of
an
invading
pathogen.
“
The
argument
is
that
one
and
one
makes
three
,
”
said
John
Moore
,
a
virologist
at
Weill
Cornell
Medicine
.
“
How
well
that
argument
holds
up
in
practice
in
the
Covid
area
is
going
to
need
to
be
judged
by
the
actual
data.
”
In
addition
to
the
potential
immunological
benefits
,
mixing
and
matching
also
“
offers
much-needed
flexibility
when
vaccine
supplies
are
uneven
or
limited
,
”
said
Zhou
Xing
,
an
immunologist
at
McMaster
University
in
Canada.Multiple
clinical
trials
are
currently
underway
to
determine
whether
there
are
benefits
or
drawbacks
.
Researchers
at
the
University
of
Oxford
are
testing
different
combinations
of
vaccines
—
including
the
AstraZeneca-Oxford
,
Pfizer-BioNTech
,
Moderna
and
Novavax
shots
—
in
the
Com-Cov
trial
,
and
the
U.S.
National
Institutes
of
Health
recently
launched
a
trial
of
mixed
booster
doses.Russian
researchers
are
testing
a
combination
of
their
Sputnik
V
vaccine
and
the
AstraZeneca
shot
.
Sputnik
is
,
itself
,
somewhat
based
on
a
mix-and-match
approach
,
with
the
first
and
second
shots
having
different
formulations.Most
studies
are
still
in
early
stages
,
but
some
have
released
promising
preliminary
results
.
Last
month
,
for
instance
,
a
team
of
Spanish
researchers
announced
that
people
who
received
a
dose
of
the
AstraZeneca
vaccine
,
followed
by
a
dose
of
the
Pfizer
vaccine
,
showed
a
robust
immune
response.This
regimen
appeared
to
elicit
a
stronger
immune
response
than
two
doses
of
the
AstraZeneca
vaccine
,
Dr.
Xing
said
.
Whether
it
is
better
than
two
doses
of
the
Pfizer
vaccine
is
not
yet
clear.Preliminary
data
from
the
Com-Cov
study
suggests
that
mixing
and
matching
vaccines
may
increase
the
odds
of
mild
and
moderate
side
effects
,
including
fever
,
fatigue
and
headache.The
data
suggest
that
a
mismatched
regimen
“
might
have
some
short-term
disadvantages
,
”
the
researchers
wrote
,
although
it
is
also
possible
that
the
side
effects
may
be
a
sign
of
a
strong
immune
response
.
Most
side
effects
faded
within
48
hours
,
they
found.Overall
,
scientists
say
that
they
expect
the
data
to
show
that
the
approach
is
safe
.
“
As
we
’
ve
learned
in
18
months
of
Covid-19
shocks
,
never
say
never
,
but
its
really
hard
to
rationalize
any
new
risk
associated
with
what
is
really
a
basic
,
tried
and
tested
immunological
approach
,
”
Daniel
Altmann
,
an
immunologist
at
Imperial
College
London
,
said
in
an
email.Health
authorities
in
a
variety
of
countries
are
allowing
some
degree
of
mixing
and
matching
.
The
U.K.
began
allowing
vaccine
mixing
in
the
early
days
of
its
vaccine
rollout.Officials
in
a
number
of
countries
—
including
Germany
,
Canada
,
Sweden
,
France
,
Spain
and
Italy
—
have
said
that
people
who
have
received
one
dose
of
the
AstraZeneca
vaccine
,
which
has
been
linked
to
a
rare
blood
clotting
disorder
,
can
receive
a
different
vaccine
for
their
second
shot
.
In
response
to
delayed
deliveries
of
the
AstraZeneca
shot
,
South
Korea
announced
last
week
that
health
care
workers
who
had
received
a
first
dose
of
that
vaccine
could
receive
the
Pfizer
shot
as
a
second
dose.Canada
’
s
vaccine
advisory
panel
has
also
said
that
the
Pfizer
and
Moderna
vaccines
can
be
used
interchangeably.The
U.S.
Food
and
Drug
Administration
has
been
more
conservative
.
The
agency
says
that
people
who
got
one
dose
of
either
the
Pfizer
or
Moderna
vaccine
may
receive
a
second
dose
of
the
other
in
“
exceptional
situations
,
”
such
as
when
the
original
vaccine
is
not
available.
“
I
can
not
imagine
that
the
F.D.A
.
will
allow
this
kind
of
mix-and-match
strategy
without
properly
evaluating
clinical
trial
data
,
”
Dr.
Moore
said.Germany
is
fiercely
protective
of
medical
privacy
,
even
that
of
its
leaders
,
but
Ms.
Merkel
’
s
spokesman
,
Steffen
Seibert
,
suggested
that
her
vaccine
choices
were
in
part
about
setting
an
example.Isolated
reports
of
abnormal
clotting
and
bleeding
prompted
many
European
countries
to
suspend
use
of
the
AstraZeneca
shot
in
March
.
Most
of
them
,
including
Germany
,
resumed
its
use
a
few
weeks
later
,
after
a
review
by
the
European
Union
’
s
drug
regulator.But
when
Ms.
Merkel
got
the
AstraZeneca
shot
in
April
,
many
people
remained
deeply
skeptical
of
it
,
slowing
the
vaccination
campaign.
“
With
her
first
vaccination
with
AstraZeneca
,
the
chancellor
was
possibly
able
to
encourage
many
people
to
get
vaccinated
with
AstraZeneca
,
”
Mr.
Seibert
told
reporters
on
Wednesday.Germany
’
s
vaccine
commission
recommended
in
April
that
anyone
under
60
who
had
received
a
first
shot
of
AstraZeneca
should
follow
it
up
with
either
Pfizer
or
Moderna
.
Regulators
relaxed
that
advice
this
month
,
but
Ms.
Merkel
,
who
is
66
,
got
the
Moderna
vaccine
a
few
days
ago.
“
Perhaps
she
can
also
relieve
people
of
their
worries
about
a
so-called
‘
cross-vaccination
’
by
getting
one
herself
,
”
Mr.
Seibert
said.It
was
not
clear
why
she
had
the
Moderna
shot
,
when
there
is
considerable
national
pride
in
Germany
about
the
work
of
BioNtech
,
a
German
company.Dr
.
Moore
,
of
Weill
Cornell
,
said
he
saw
no
problem
with
mixing
vaccines
,
but
he
was
curious
about
what
expert
advice
Ms.
Merkel
had
received
about
it
.
He
said
he
doubted
that
an
American
president
would
have
done
the
same
at
this
stage
of
the
pandemic
,
because
U.S.
regulators
,
who
are
extremely
cautious
,
have
not
approved
it.Even
as
millions
of
Americans
leap
into
a
mostly
normal
summer
,
some
residents
are
holding
back
—
and
it
’
s
not
because
they
’
re
afraid
to
get
sick.Following
a
surge
in
anti-Asian
attacks
during
the
pandemic
,
many
Asian
Americans
say
they
fear
being
attacked
if
they
venture
back
to
normal
life.Some
people
are
still
avoiding
public
transportation
,
while
others
are
staying
away
from
restaurants
or
dreading
the
end
of
remote
work
.
Some
Asian
American
parents
are
keeping
their
children
at
home
out
of
concern
for
their
safety
:
Just
18
percent
of
Asian
American
fourth
graders
have
returned
to

Tuesday
morning
,
U.S.
federal
health
regulators
recommended
a
pause
in
the
use
of
Johnson
&
Johnson
’
s
Covid-19
vaccine
while
they
investigated
six
reports
of
blood
clots
in
women
ages
18
to
48
.
One
has
died
,
and
a
second
is
hospitalized
in
critical
condition.On
Wednesday
,
two
more
cases
were
added
to
the
list
:
a
seventh
woman
who
received
the
vaccine
after
it
was
authorized
,
and
a
man
who
received
it
during
a
clinical
trial.Seven
of
the
eight
had
blood
clots
in
the
brain.As
of
Thursday
,
7.4
million
people
in
the
United
States
had
received
the
vaccine
without
any
other
serious
adverse
reactions
reported.Experts
have
yet
to
determine
to
what
extent
,
if
any
,
the
vaccine
is
responsible
for
the
clots
.
But
the
investigation
follows
actions
by
European
regulators
who
concluded
that
a
vaccine
made
by
AstraZeneca
may
also
be
the
cause
of
a
similar
,
extremely
rare
clotting
disorder.U.S
.
and
European
public
health
experts
have
emphasized
that
for
most
people
,
the
benefits
of
the
Covid
vaccines
far
outweigh
the
risks
.
Several
countries
in
Europe
last
week
restricted
use
of
the
AstraZeneca-Oxford
vaccine
to
older
adults
because
rare
cases
of
a
blood
disorder
were
occurring
in
younger
people
.
Some
countries
chose
not
to
use
it
,
and
the
European
Medicines
Agency
has
decided
not
to
renew
contracts
with
AstraZeneca
or
Johnson
&
Johnson
.
The
AstraZeneca
vaccine
has
not
been
authorized
in
the
United
States.The
number
of
cases
is
small
.
If
there
is
indeed
a
risk
of
blood
clots
from
the
vaccine
—
which
has
yet
to
be
determined
—
that
risk
is
extremely
low
.
The
risk
of
getting
Covid-19
in
the
United
States
is
far
higher.So
far
,
the
overall
risk
appears
to
be
about
one
case
per
million
vaccinations
.
But
for
women
20
to
50
,
it
may
be
higher
.
Dr.
Tom
Shimabukuro
,
a
safety
expert
at
the
C.D.C.
,
said
on
Wednesday
that
the
risk
for
women
in
the
age
range
appeared
to
be
at
least
three
times
the
rate
that
would
normally
be
expected
.
But
he
said
that
figure
was
a
rough
estimate.The
F.D.A
.
recommends
that
people
who
have
received
the
Johnson
&
Johnson
vaccine
within
the
past
three
weeks
should
contact
their
doctors
if
they
experience
severe
headaches
,
abdominal
pain
,
leg
pain
or
shortness
of
breath
.
Doctors
seeing
people
with
those
symptoms
,
particularly
if
the
patients
are
young
women
,
should
ask
if
they
recently
received
a
Covid
vaccination
,
Dr.
Anthony
Fauci
,
the
Biden
administration
’
s
chief
science
adviser
,
said
at
a
news
briefing
on
Tuesday.People
should
not
be
concerned
about
mild
headaches
and
flu-like
symptoms
in
the
first
few
days
after
vaccination
.
Those
are
common
,
harmless
side
effects
brought
on
by
the
immune
system
’
s
production
of
a
defense
against
the
coronavirus.For
people
who
received
the
vaccine
a
month
or
two
ago
,
the
issue
being
raised
about
clots
“
doesn
’
t
mean
anything
,
”
Dr.
Fauci
said
.
The
six
cases
occurred
within
a
“
pretty
tight
window
”
of
six
to
13
days
after
people
received
the
shot
,
he
said.During
clinical
trials
and
after
vaccines
go
into
wide
use
,
experts
keep
track
of
any
medical
problems
experienced
by
people
who
receive
them
.
If
an
unusually
large
cluster
of
cases
turns
up
,
regulators
may
decide
to
pause
a
trial
or
stop
the
use
of
a
vaccine
to
investigate
further.Pauses
are
common
,
and
typically
the
investigations
reveal
that
the
medical
problems
were
a
matter
of
coincidence
.
If
the
investigation
reveals
that
a
vaccine
does
pose
a
risk
,
regulators
may
write
new
guidance
about
who
should
or
should
not
receive
it
.
The
pause
also
gives
them
time
to
advise
doctors
about
how
to
recognize
and
treat
the
condition.In
this
instance
,
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
and
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
are
recommending
a
pause
,
and
states
have
already
heeded
the
agencies
’
advice
.
Among
businesses
temporarily
stopping
use
of
the
vaccine
are
CVS
Health
and
Walgreens.In
a
news
conference
on
Tuesday
,
federal
officials
said
that
the
government
’
s
review
would
likely
take
only
a
matter
of
days
.
But
a
C.D.C
.
advisory
panel
on
Wednesday
extended
the
pause
,
by
deciding
to
make
no
recommendation
about
the
vaccine
for
at
least
a
week
,
so
they
could
gather
more
information
about
the
clotting
problem.Seven
women
in
the
United
States
who
received
the
Johnson
&
Johnson
vaccine
,
and
one
man
who
received
it
in
a
clinical
trial
,
developed
a
rare
disorder
involving
blood
clots
within
about
two
weeks
of
vaccination
.
In
seven
of
the
eight
with
the
condition
,
called
cerebral
venous
sinus
thrombosis
,
clots
formed
in
veins
that
drain
blood
from
the
brain
.
The
results
are
“
stroke-like
,
”
Dr.
Anne
Schuchat
of
the
C.D.C
.
said.Researchers
studying
a
very
similar
disorder
in
AstraZeneca
recipients
in
Europe
say
it
appears
to
be
caused
by
an
intense
reaction
to
the
vaccine
by
the
immune
system
,
which
generates
antibodies
that
activate
platelets
,
a
blood
component
that
helps
form
normal
clots
to
repair
wounds
.
In
addition
to
clots
,
abnormal
bleeding
occurs
.
European
researchers
have
called
the
disorder
identified
there
“
vaccine-induced
immune
thrombotic
thrombocytopenia.
”
Dr
.
Peter
Marks
of
the
F.D.A
.
said
it
was
the
unusual
combination
of
clotting
and
bleeding
that
set
up
a
red
flag
for
regulators
as
a
possible
safety
signal.So
far
,
researchers
have
not
found
a
way
to
predict
who
will
develop
the
disorder
and
have
not
identified
any
underlying
condition
that
might
indicate
susceptibility.Dr
.
Fauci
said
that
if
scientists
could
identify
some
common
underlying
trait
in
the
women
who
developed
the
clots
,
it
might
help
to
determine
who
is
at
risk
and
enable
regulators
to
establish
categories
of
people
who
should
not
receive
the
J
&
J
vaccine.A
blood
clot
is
a
thickened
,
gelatinous
blob
of
blood
that
can
block
circulation
.
Clots
form
in
response
to
injuries
and
can
also
be
caused
by
many
illnesses
,
including
cancer
and
genetic
disorders
,
certain
drugs
and
prolonged
sitting
or
bed
rest
.
Covid
itself
can
trigger
serious
clotting
problems
.
Clots
that
form
in
the
legs
sometimes
break
off
and
travel
to
the
lungs
or
,
rarely
,
to
the
brain
,
where
they
can
be
deadly.In
the
United
States
,
300,000
to
600,000
people
a
year
develop
blood
clots
in
their
lungs
or
in
leg
veins
or
other
parts
of
the
body
,
according
to
the
C.D.C.Based
on
that
data
,
about
1,000
to
2,000
blood
clots
occur
in
the
U.S.
population
every
day
.
With
several
million
people
a
day
now
getting
vaccinated
,
some
of
those
clots
will
occur
in
those
receiving
the
shots
just
by
coincidence
,
unrelated
to
the
vaccine.In
Britain
,
regulators
have
said
,
roughly
one
in
1,000
people
are
affected
by
a
blood
clot
in
a
vein
every
year.But
the
clotting
disorder
of
concern
in
the
vaccine
recipients
is
much
rarer
and
different
from
typical
blood
clots
.
In
addition
to
clotting
in
the
brain
—
called
cerebral
venous
sinus
thrombosis
,
or
CVST
for
short
—
the
patients
all
had
a
notably
low
level
of
platelets
,
which
left
them
prone
to
abnormal
bleeding.On
Tuesday
,
Johnson
&
Johnson
said
the
company
was
aware
of
an
extremely
rare
disorder
involving
people
with
blood
clots
in
combination
with
low
platelets
in
a
small
number
of
individuals
who
have
received
its
vaccine
.
“
In
addition
,
we
have
been
reviewing
these
cases
with
European
health
authorities
,
”
the
company
said
in
its
statement
.
“
We
have
made
the
decision
to
proactively
delay
the
rollout
of
our
vaccine
in
Europe.
”
At
the
news
conference
on
Tuesday
,
Dr.
Marks
of
the
F.D.A
.
said
the
cases
were
“
very
,
very
similar.
”
Both
Johnson
&
Johnson
and
AstraZeneca
use
adenoviruses
to
carry
DNA
into
human
cells
to
begin
the
process
of
generating
immunity
to
the
coronavirus
.
It
is
not
yet
known
whether
that
technology
causes
the
problem.German
researchers
have
speculated
that
DNA
from
the
vaccine
may
set
off
the
immune
reaction
in
some
people
.
But
the
condition
is
so
rare
that
the
researchers
say
patients
likely
also
have
some
individual
biological
trait
—
as
yet
unknown
—
that
predisposes
them
to
the
immune
overreaction.Last
month
,
European
regulators
began
investigating
similar
cases
of
cerebral
venous
thrombosis
linked
to
low
platelets
.
They
concluded
that
the
disorder
was
a
very
rare
side
effect
of
the
AstraZeneca
vaccine
.
It
’
s
too
early
yet
to
know
if
Johnson
&
Johnson
’
s
vaccine
is
responsible
for
the
same
type
of
rare
blood
clot.European
regulators
had
recommended
that
recipients
of
the
vaccine
seek
medical
assistance
for
a
number
of
possible
symptoms
,
including
swelling
in
the
leg
,
persistent
abdominal
pain
,
severe
and
persistent
headaches
or
blurred
vision
,
and
tiny
blood
spots
under
the
skin
beyond
the
area
where
the
injection
was
given.But
that
set
of
symptoms
was
so
vague
that
almost
immediately
,
British
emergency
rooms
experienced
a
surge
in
patients
who
were
worried
that
they
fit
the
description.Nonetheless
,
German
researchers
say
that
such
symptoms
in
vaccine
recipients
must
be
followed
up
.
Blood
tests
can
detect
the
antibodies.Doctors
in
Germany
and
Norway
have
treated
patients
with
blood-thinning
drugs
to
try
to
stop
the
growth
of
the
clots
,
and
with
intravenous
immune
globulin
,
which
can
help
eliminate
the
misguided
antibodies
that
are
causing
the
problem.Researchers
there
and
U.S.
federal
health
officials
on
Tuesday
advised
against
using
a
common
blood
thinner
,
heparin
,
and
recommended
choosing
alternative
medicines
instead
.
The
reason
is
that
the
disorder
closely
resembles
a
rare
syndrome
caused
by
heparin
,
and
it
is
possible
that
heparin
could
make
things
worse
in
these
patients.Heparin
could
cause
“
tremendous
harm
,
”
Dr.
Marks
said.German
researchers
have
emphasized
that
treatment
should
begin
as
soon
as
possible
,
because
the
condition
can
worsen
rapidly.We
don
’
t
know
yet
.
Seven
of
the
eight
cases
being
investigated
among
people
who
got
the
J
&
J
vaccine
involve
women
.
However
,
that
number
is
so
small
that
it
’
s
impossible
to
draw
firm
conclusions
from
it.Asked
on
Tuesday
whether
use
of
contraceptives
could
be
a
contributing
risk
factor
,
U.S.
health
officials
said
they
did
not
know
of
any
link.In
Europe
,
62
cases
were
reported
after
the
AstraZeneca
vaccine
,
most
in
women
under
60
.
It
initially
appeared
that
women
were
at
greater
risk
blood
clots
associated
with
the
AstraZeneca
vaccine
,
although
some
cases
involved
men
who
had
received
the
vaccine.On
closer
investigation
,
it
turned
out
that
more
women
were
getting
the
vaccine
overall
in
some
countries
,
because
they
’
re
overrepresented
among
health
care
workers
.
In
Britain
,
51
cases
in
women
and
28
in
men
were
reported
.
British
regulators
now
say
that
they
don
’
t
have
evidence
to
say
whether
men
or
women
are
more
likely
to
be
affected
by
blood
clots.The
F.D.A
.
has
not
found
any
similar
cases
in
people
who
have
received
the
Moderna
or
Pfizer-BioNTech
vaccines.Lowered
platelet
levels
,
however
,
have
been
reported
in
small
numbers
of
patients
who
received
the
Moderna
,
Pfizer-BioNTech
and
AstraZeneca
vaccines
.
One
recipient
,
a
physician
in
Florida
,
died
from
a
brain
hemorrhage
when
his
platelet
levels
could
not
be
restored
,
and
others
have
been
hospitalized
.
U.S.
health
officials
have
said
that
the
cases
are
being
investigated
,
but
they
have
not
reported
the
findings
of
those
reviews
and
have
yet
to
indicate
that
there
is
any
link
to
the
vaccines.Over
the
last
15
months
,
I
’
ve
relied
on
my
colleague
Mitch
Smith
,
who
tracks
the
coronavirus
for
The
Times
,
to
explain
the
virus
situation
in
the
U.S.
for
this
newsletter
.
In
the
past
,
when
talking
about
the
national
outlook
,
he
commonly
used
words
like
“
terrible
,
”
lousy
”
and
“
awful.
”
But
when
I
rang
up
Mitch
today
,
his
tone
was
different.
“
The
national
picture
uniformly
looks
good
right
now
,
”
he
said
.
The
country
is
averaging
below
15,000
cases
per
day
,
the
lowest
since
testing
became
widely
available
,
and
cases
continue
to
decline
rapidly
.
Deaths
are
falling
,
as
are
hospitalizations.
“
This
feels
very
different
than
other
moments
when
cases
have
declined
,
”
Mitch
said
.
“
Recently
,
they
’
ve
declined
a
lot
,
they
’
ve
declined
just
about
everywhere
,
and
a
very
large
percentage
of
people
are
now
vaccinated
.
So
this
does
feel
like
an
extremely
hopeful
moment
,
although
something
short
of
‘
it
’
s
over
,
we
’
re
home
free.
’
”
Mitch
isn
’
t
seeing
troubling
signs
in
the
case
data
,
like
cities
or
states
where
cases
are
beginning
to
bubble
up
.
“
You
look
at
the
map
today
and
you
see
only
a
few
small
counties
that
have
reason
for
concern
,
”
he
said
.
“
But
really
small
counties.
”
Of
course
,
case
rates
don
’
t
tell
the
whole
story
of
the
pandemic
,
and
Mitch
said
he
is
worried
about
the
lagging
vaccination
rates
in
the
South
.
Experts
are
warning
that
it
could
lead
to
a
Covid
surge
there
this
summer
.
However
,
if
there
is
a
surge
,
it
won
’
t
be
as
grave
as
last
summer
,
experts
say
,
because
many
people
are
vaccinated
and
treatments
have
improved.The
other
big
mystery
is
the
direction
of
the
variants
.
As
David
Leonhardt
wrote
in
today
’
s
Morning
newsletter
,
the
Delta
variant
first
detected
in
India
has
doubled
cases
in
Britain
during
the
last
month
,
to
4,000
a
day
from
about
2,000
.
Britain
’
s
experience
suggests
that
cases
may
soon
rise
in
the
U.S.
“
The
increase
is
a
reminder
that
progress
against
the
pandemic
—
even
extreme
progress
—
does
not
equal
ultimate
victory
,
”
David
wrote.Although
many
scientists
estimate
that
coronavirus
vaccines
will
last
at
least
a
year
,
no
one
knows
for
sure
.
I
asked
my
colleague
Carl
Zimmer
what
we
know
so
far.How
do
Covid-19
vaccines
stack
up
in
terms
of
protection
?
Early
signs
are
encouraging
.
Researchers
have
been
drawing
blood
from
volunteers
in
vaccine
trials
and
measuring
their
levels
of
antibodies
and
immune
cells
that
target
the
coronavirus
.
The
levels
are
dropping
,
but
gradually
.
It
’
s
possible
that
with
this
slow
rate
of
decline
,
vaccine
protection
will
remain
strong
for
a
long
time
.
People
who
were
previously
infected
and
then
received
the
vaccine
may
enjoy
even
more
durable
protection.Will
some
Covid
vaccines
last
longer
than
others
?
Scientists
have
already
found
that
vaccines
using
different
technologies
can
vary
in
their
effectiveness
.
The
strongest
vaccines
include
Moderna
and
Pfizer-BioNTech
,
both
of
which
are
based
on
RNA
molecules
.
Vaccines
relying
on
inactivated
viruses
,
such
as
those
made
by
Sinopharm
in
China
and
Bharat
Biotech
in
India
,
have
proved
somewhat
less
effective.How
will
we
know
when
our
vaccines
are
losing
their
effectiveness
?
Scientists
are
searching
for
biological
markers
that
could
reveal
when
the
protection
from
a
vaccine
is
no
longer
enough
to
hold
back
the
coronavirus
.
It
’
s
possible
that
a
certain
level
of
antibodies
marks
a
threshold
:
If
your
blood
measures
above
that
level
,
you
’
re
in
good
shape
,
but
if
you
’
re
below
it
,
you
’
re
at
greater
risk
of
infection.What
about
the
variants
?
The
emergence
of
variants
in
recent
months
has
accelerated
research
on
boosters
.
Some
variants
have
mutations
that
lead
them
to
spread
swiftly
.
Others
carry
mutations
that
might
blunt
the
effectiveness
of
authorized
vaccines
.
But
at
this
point
,
scientists
still
have
only
a
smattering
of
clues
about
how
existing
vaccines
work
against
different
variants.In
August
,
New
York
City
is
planing
a
megaconcert
in
Central
Park
to
celebrate
its
reopening
.
In
two
weeks
,
California
will
lift
most
of
its
virus
restrictions
.
Across

and

Biden
is
promising
Americans
that
a
return
to
normal
will
be
within
reach
if
70
percent
of
adults
get
at
least
one
dose
of
the
Covid
vaccine
by
July
4
.
But
with
one
month
remaining
before
his
deadline
,
how
close
is
the
U.S.
to
reaching
the
president
’
s
goal
?
Close
,
but
not
quite
there.According
to
a
New
York
Times
analysis
,
if
the
current
rate
of
vaccination
holds
,
the
nation
will
ultimately
fall
just
short
of
the
objective
,
with
roughly
68
percent
of
adults
partly
vaccinated.Substantially
boosting
the
vaccination
rate
is
a
daunting
task
:
As
more
people
become
inoculated
,
the
pool
of
the
most
willing
adults
is
shrinking
.
To
nudge
the
nation
toward
his
target
,
the
president
yesterday
laid
out
an
aggressive
campaign
that
includes
incentives
from
Super
Bowl
tickets
to
free
beer.Vaccinating
70
percent
of
the
population
by
Independence
Day
would
have
seemed
like
phenomenal
progress
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
,
when
the
vaccine
rollout
was
moving
at
a
glacial
pace
.
And
as
of
yesterday
,
about
63
percent
of
adults
had
received
at
least
one
shot.Still
,
that
promising
national
figure
masks
a
worrying
issue
:
the
very
uneven
vaccination
rate
among
the
states.While
12
states
,
including
California
and
Maryland
,
have
already
passed
the
70
percent
mark
,
30
states
will
probably
not
reach
the
national
target
.
In
Wyoming
and
Tennessee
,
for
example
,
projections
show
that
the
rate
is
unlikely
to
reach
much
higher
than
50
percent
by
early
July.Vaccinations
have
leveled
off
in
many
states
in
the
Deep
South
and
Mountain
West
because
of
limited
access
and
shot
hesitancy
.
A
few
states
,
like
Alabama
and
Mississippi
,
have
fallen
far
behind
and
are
unlikely
to
reach
70
percent
before
spring
2022.Even
statewide
numbers
can
hide
local
problems
.
In
some
parishes
in
Louisiana
,
for
example
,
less
than
20
percent
of
people
have
received
a
first
dose.Officials
in
lagging
states
have
said
they
are
hopeful
that
they
can
continue
to
vaccinate
more
people
,
but
warn
that
it
may
take
months
to
make
vaccines
more
convenient
and
persuade
those
who
have
fallen
behind
to
get
a
shot.Our
colleague
Denise
Grady
will
soon
retire
from
The
Times
after
more
than
20
years
on
the
Science
desk
.
For
one
of
her
last
stories
,
she
wrote
about
Dr.
Tomoaki
Kato
,
a
renowned
transplant
surgeon
who
contracted
Covid
last
spring.In
March
2020
,
Dr.
Kato
continued
to
perform
surgery
,
even
as
hospitals
in
New
York
City
began
postponing
operations
to
make
way
for
the
flood
of
Covid-19
patients.
“
He
had
patients
who
would
die
if
they
wouldn
’
t
get
their
transplants
,
”
Denise
said.When
he
got
sick
,
Dr.
Kato
,
a
56-year-old
marathon
runner
,
initially
didn
’
t
worry
.
But
things
quickly
worsened
.
His
colleagues
put
him
on
a
ventilator
.
Then
,
he
developed
sepsis
.
His
kidneys
began
to
fail.As
Dr.
Kato
’
s
colleagues
struggled
to
save
him
,
a
waiting
list
of
surgical
patients
clung
to
hopes
that
he
would
soon
be
able
to
save
them
.
Because
Dr.
Kato
is
not
just
any
transplant
surgeon
.
(
Denise
has
watched
him
operate
in
the
past
,
and
described
him
as
a
“
magician.
”
)
Instead
,
Dr.
Kato
specializes
in
cancer
surgeries
where
he
cuts
out
an
entire
organ
,
removes
the
affected
part
and
then
sews
the
rest
back
in
place
.
Once
,
he
and
his
team
removed
—
and
then
replaced
—
six
organs
from
a
7-year-old
girl
with
abdominal
cancer
.
In
August
,
after
a
two-month
stay
in
his
own
hospital
,
Dr.
Kato
began
operating
again
.
And
he
’
s
doing
so
with
memories
of
his
own
experience
at
the
fore.Denise
sees
Dr.
Kato
’
s
ordeal
as
something
of
a
metaphor
for
this
past
year.
“
It
’
s
almost
like
a
capsule
of
the
whole
pandemic
,
the
whole
siege
that
we
’
ve
been
through
,
”
she
said
.
“
You
get
an
idea
of
how
really
awful
this
disease
is
,
but
at
least
,
with
Dr.
Kato
,
there
’
s
a
good
ending.

sudden
,
sharp
rise
in
coronavirus
cases
in
many
parts
of
Africa
could
amount
to
a
continental
third
wave
,
the
World
Health
Organization
warned
on
Thursday
,
a
portent
of
deeper
trouble
for
a
continent
whose
immunization
drives
have
been
crippled
by
shortfalls
in
funding
and
vaccine
doses.The
W.H.O.
,
an
arm
of
the
United
Nations
,
said
test
positivity
had
risen
in
14
African
countries
over
the
last
seven
days
,
with
eight
reporting
a
surge
of
over
30
percent
in
new
cases
.
Infections
are
steadily
climbing
in
South
Africa
,
where
four
of
nine
provinces
are
battling
a
third
wave
.
There
has
also
been
a
sharp
increase
in
cases
in
Uganda
,
with
hospitals
overwhelmed
with
Covid
patients
and
the
authorities
mulling
a
lockdown.The
W.H.O
.
attributed
the
rise
to
loose
compliance
with
social
restrictions
,
and
increasing
travel
along
with
the
arrival
of
the
winter
season
in
southern
Africa.Experts
also
believe
the
spread
of
new
coronavirus
variants
—
like
those
first
identified
in
Britain
,
India
and
South
Africa
—
is
contributing
to
the
surge
and
the
ensuing
rise
in
deaths
.
While
Africa
has
reported
less
than
3
percent
of
global
coronavirus
cases
,
the
W.H.O
.
said
the
continent
accounted
for
3.7
percent
of
total
deaths
.
And
that
is
almost
certainly
a
severe
undercount
,
since
in
the
vast
majority
of
countries
on
the
African
continent
,
most
deaths
are
never
formally
registered.
“
The
threat
of
a
third
wave
in
Africa
is
real
and
rising
,
”
Dr.
Matshidiso
Moeti
,
the
W.H.O
.
regional
director
for
Africa
,
said
in
a
statement
.
“
It
’
s
crucial
that
we
swiftly
get
vaccines
into
the
arms
of
Africans
at
high
risk
of
falling
seriously
ill
and
dying
of
Covid-19.
”
While
many
wealthier
countries
have
vigorous
vaccination
campaigns
and
some
are
on
track
to
fully
reopen
,
many
of
Africa
’
s
poorer
countries
face
a
huge
challenge
in
accessing
vaccines.Out
of
a
continental
population
of
1.3
billion
people
,
only
31
million
have
received
at
least
one
dose
,
Dr.
Moeti
said
.
Seven
million
are
fully
vaccinated
.
In
Kenya
,
one
of
Africa
’
s
biggest
economies
,
with
more
than
50
million
people
,
only
1,386
have
received
two
doses
of
a
vaccine.Countries
like
Ghana
and
Rwanda
have
run
through
their
first
deliveries
of
vaccines
through
Covax
,
the
global
facility
working
to
ensure
the
equitable
distribution
of
vaccines.Vaccine
hesitancy
has
afflicted
the
rollout
in
nations
like
Malawi
,
while
concerns
over
rare
blood
clots
and
limitations
in
inoculation
capacity
pushed
the
Democratic
Republic
of
Congo
to
donate
millions
of
doses
to
other
African
states
before
they
expired.The
rising
cases
,
the
W.H.O
.
warned
,
could
overwhelm
already
creaky
health
care
systems
that
are
struggling
with
limited
intensive
care
beds
,
oxygen
and
ventilators
.
To
forestall
a
full-blown
crisis
,
Dr.
Moeti
urged
“
countries
that
have
reached
a
significant
vaccination
coverage
to
release
doses
and
keep
the
most
vulnerable
Africans
out
of
critical
care.
”
News
headlines
and
health
experts
on
social
media
are
sounding
the
alarm
over
another
variant
of
the
coronavirus
,
this
time
Delta
,
claiming
it
is
much
more
contagious
and
perhaps
more
lethal
than
any
other
variant
seen
so
far
.
It
’
s
easy
to
understand
why
:
New
variants
of
the
virus
continue
to
emerge
,
and
cases
are
rising
in
many
countries
.
But
whether
new
variants
pose
a
unique
or
substantial
risk
is
still
unknown
,
and
as
virologists
,
we
are
concerned
that
misunderstanding
variants
and
the
risk
they
pose
can
cause
confusion
and
panic.As
the
coronavirus
spread
globally
,
its
genome
changed
—
mutated
—
as
expected
for
any
virus
.
These
mutations
may
affect
the
virus
’
s
“
fitness
,
”
its
ability
to
reproduce
and
spread
.
Some
mutations
weaken
a
virus
,
some
have
no
measurable
effect
,
and
some
make
it
stronger.As
a
virus
becomes
more
fit
,
it
will
outcompete
less
fit
viruses
—
and
Delta
is
not
the
first
variant
that
has
beat
its
predecessors
and
competitors
in
certain
areas
.
There
’
s
the
Alpha
variant
that
first
became
dominant
in
Britain
,
and
the
Gamma
variant
that
first
became
dominant
in
Brazil
.
Such
changes
are
not
unique
to
the
coronavirus
.
Increased
viral
fitness
happens
during
every
flu
season
and
is
why
some
flu
variants
may
circulate
more
widely
than
others.Just
because
a
variant
displaces
another
does
not
necessarily
mean
it
is
more
infectious
or
more
deadly
to
the
people
who
become
infected
with
it
.
As
has
been
true
for
the
past
year
and
a
half
,
human
behavior
is
far
more
important
in
shaping
the
course
of
the
pandemic
than
any
variant.There
are
many
ways
that
a
virus
can
mutate
to
increase
its
fitness
.
While
there
’
s
been
much
focus
on
changes
in
the
virus
’
s
spike
proteins
,
which
allow
the
coronavirus
to
invade
cells
,
a
virus
can
also
sustain
changes
in
other
proteins
.
Such
changes
can
allow
the
virus
to
replicate
more
easily
or
evade
the
immune
system
,
for
example
.
They
may
even
allow
the
virus
to
persist
longer
in
nasal
passages.Determining
what
impact
a
given
mutation
has
requires
substantial
laboratory
research
.
Sometimes
,
early
conclusions
about
a
particular
mutation
can
be
incorrect
.
When
the
first
variant
of
note
,
D614G
,
emerged
last
winter
,
some
scientists
believed
changes
to
the
virus
’
s
spike
protein
made
the
virus
more
contagious
.
But
subsequent
research
showed
that
was
not
the
case
.
Even
so
,
each
time
a
new
change
in
the
spike
protein
is
identified
,
many
experts
presume
the
variant
is
more
virulent
and
“
of
concern.
”
But
whether
any
variant
is
biologically
more
transmissible
or
causes
more
severe
illness
has
not
been
rigorously
tested.Right
now
,
conclusions
about
variant
transmissibility
are
based
largely
on
how
widespread
the
variant
is
.
A
variant
might
be
deemed
more
contagious
because
it
makes
up
a
higher
proportion
of
new
infections
.
Delta
is
now
the
most
common
variant
in
India
and
Britain
,
accounting
for
more
than
90
percent
of
new
cases
,
and
over
20
percent
of
new
infections
in
the
United
States
.
Not
all
virologists
,
including
us
,
agree
that
measurements
like
this
are
sufficient
to
declare
a
variant
more
transmissible
or
more
contagious
.
What
’
s
clear
is
Delta
may
be
the
fitter
and
dominant
variant
for
now.To
determine
increased
transmissibility
,
the
ability
of
the
virus
to
be
passed
on
from
one
person
to
another
,
requires
more
than
measuring
infection
rates
.
It
may
require
experiments
in
people
,
which
are
unethical
to
conduct.Changes
in
people
’
s
activities
contribute
to
the
rise
of
infections
—
such
as
travel
,
failure
to
mask
and
to
adhere
to
physical
distancing
policies
,
and
most
important
right
now
,
insufficient
vaccination
—
and
these
are
often
not
considered
in
public
discussion
of
variants.The
huge
infection
numbers
in
India
,
Nigeria
and
other
places
are
not
necessarily
because
of
a
particular
variant
,
but
in
large
part
because
of
breached
containment
measures
and
crowded
populations
with
poor
public
health
infrastructures
.
If
people
are
in
situations
in
which
they
can
be
infected
with
the
coronavirus
,
it
’
s
highly
likely
they
will
be
infected
with
the
fittest
variant
in
the
area
.
Right
now
,
in
many
places
,
that
’
s
Delta.What
’
s
important
to
understand
is
that
people
infected
with
the
variants
do
not
necessarily
develop
more
severe
disease
or
die
more
frequently
from
the
coronavirus
,
and
it
is
essential
to
get
vaccinated.The
coronavirus
vaccines
that
have
been
developed
are
very
effective
in
preventing
severe
disease
and
death
caused
by
all
variants
,
including
Delta
.
Vaccines
might
not
always
prevent
infections
,
but
they
make
a
substantial
impact
in
reducing
virus
spread
and
risk
for
serious
health
problems
.
People
who
are
unvaccinated
are
at
a
great
risk
for
infection
and
harm
from
any
variant
of
the
coronavirus.During
a
pandemic
,
a
time
of
unknowns
,
people
want
immediate
answers
to
the
question
,
what
does
this
mutation
mean
?
Providing
the
correct
answers
may
require
years
of
research
.
For
now
,
there
’
s
little
evidence
that
the
virus
is
on
an
endless
trajectory
of
increased
transmission
and
virulence
.
Today
’
s
vaccines
can
still
end
this
pandemic.The
vaccines
made
by
Pfizer-BioNTech
and
Moderna
set
off
a
persistent
immune
reaction
in
the
body
that
may
protect
against
the
coronavirus
for
years
,
scientists
reported
on
Monday.The
findings
add
to
growing
evidence
that
most
people
immunized
with
the
mRNA
vaccines
may
not
need
boosters
,
so
long
as
the
virus
and
its
variants
do
not
evolve
much
beyond
their
current
forms
—
which
is
not
guaranteed
.
People
who
recovered
from
Covid-19
before
being
vaccinated
may
not
need
boosters
even
if
the
virus
does
make
a
significant
transformation.
“
It
’
s
a
good
sign
for
how
durable
our
immunity
is
from
this
vaccine
,
”
said
Ali
Ellebedy
,
an
immunologist
at
Washington
University
in
St.
Louis
who
led
the
study
,
which
was
published
in
the
journal
Nature.The
study
did
not
consider
the
coronavirus
vaccine
made
by
Johnson
&
Johnson
,
but
Dr.
Ellebedy
said
he
expected
the
immune
response
to
be
less
durable
than
that
produced
by
mRNA
vaccines.Dr
.
Ellebedy
and
his
colleagues
reported
last
month
that
in
people
who
survived
Covid-19
,
immune
cells
that
recognize
the
virus
lie
quiescent
in
the
bone
marrow
for
at
least
eight
months
after
infection
.
A
study
by
another
team
indicated
that
so-called
memory
B
cells
continue
to
mature
and
strengthen
for
at
least
a
year
after
infection.Based
on
those
findings
,
researchers
suggested
that
immunity
might
last
for
years
,
possibly
a
lifetime
,
in
people
who
were
infected
with
the
coronavirus
and
later
vaccinated
.
But
it
was
unclear
whether
vaccination
alone
might
have
a
similarly
long-lasting
effect.Dr
.
Ellebedy
’
s
team
sought
to
address
that
question
by
looking
at
the
source
of
memory
cells
:
the
lymph
nodes
,
where
immune
cells
train
to
recognize
and
fight
the
virus.After
an
infection
or
a
vaccination
,
a
specialized
structure
called
the
germinal
center
forms
in
lymph
nodes
.
This
structure
is
an
elite
school
of
sorts
for
B
cells
—
a
boot
camp
where
they
become
increasingly
sophisticated
and
learn
to
recognize
a
diverse
set
of
viral
genetic
sequences.The
broader
the
range
and
the
longer
these
cells
have
to
practice
,
the
more
likely
they
are
to
be
able
to
thwart
variants
of
the
virus
that
may
emerge.
“
Everyone
always
focuses
on
the
virus
evolving
—
this
is
showing
that
the
B
cells
are
doing
the
same
thing
,
”
said
Marion
Pepper
,
an
immunologist
at
the
University
of
Washington
in
Seattle
.
“
And
it
’
s
going
to
be
protective
against
ongoing
evolution
of
the
virus
,
which
is
really
encouraging.
”
After
infection
with
the
coronavirus
,
the
germinal
center
forms
in
the
lungs
.
But
after
vaccination
,
the
cells
’
education
takes
place
in
lymph
nodes
in
the
armpits
,
within
reach
of
researchers.Dr
.
Ellebedy
and
his
colleagues
recruited
41
people
—
including
eight
with
a
history
of
infection
with
the
virus
—
who
were
immunized
with
two
doses
of
the
Pfizer-BioNTech
vaccine
.
From
14
of
these
people
,
the
team
extracted
samples
from
the
lymph
nodes
at
three
,
four
,
five
,
seven
and
15
weeks
after
the
first
dose.That
painstaking
work
makes
this
a
“
heroic
study
,
”
said
Akiko
Iwasaki
,
an
immunologist
at
Yale
.
“
This
kind
of
careful
time-course
analysis
in
humans
is
very
difficult
to
do.
”
Dr
.
Ellebedy
’
s
team
found
that
15
weeks
after
the
first
dose
of
vaccine
,
the
germinal
center
was
still
highly
active
in
all
14
of
the
participants
,
and
that
the
number
of
memory
cells
that
recognized
the
coronavirus
had
not
declined.
“
The
fact
that
the
reactions
continued
for
almost
four
months
after
vaccination
—
that
’
s
a
very
,
very
good
sign
,
”
Dr.
Ellebedy
said
.
Germinal
centers
typically
peak
one
to
two
weeks
after
immunization
,
and
then
wane.
“
Usually
by
four
to
six
weeks
,
there
’
s
not
much
left
,
”
said
Deepta
Bhattacharya
,
an
immunologist
at
the
University
of
Arizona
.
But
germinal
centers
stimulated
by
the
mRNA
vaccines
are
“
still
going
,
months
into
it
,
and
not
a
lot
of
decline
in
most
people.
”
Dr
.
Bhattacharya
noted
that
most
of
what
scientists
know
about
the
persistence
of
germinal
centers
is
based
on
animal
research
.
The
new
study
is
the
first
to
show
what
happens
in
people
after
vaccination.The
results
suggest
that
a
vast
majority
of
vaccinated
people
will
be
protected
over
the
long
term
—
at
least
,
against
the
existing
coronavirus
variants
.
But
older
adults
,
people
with
weak
immune
systems
and
those
who
take
drugs
that
suppress
immunity
may
need
boosters
;
people
who
survived
Covid-19
and
were
later
immunized
may
never
need
them
at
all.Exactly
how
long
the
protection
from
mRNA
vaccines
will
last
is
hard
to
predict
.
In
the
absence
of
variants
that
sidestep
immunity
,
in
theory
immunity
could
last
a
lifetime
,
experts
said
.
But
the
virus
is
clearly
evolving.
“
Anything
that
would
actually
require
a
booster
would
be
variant-based
,
not
based
on
waning
of
immunity
,
”
Dr.
Bhattacharya
said
.
“
I
just
don
’
t
see
that
happening.
”
People
who
were
infected
with
the
coronavirus
and
then
immunized
see
a
major
boost
in
their
antibody
levels
,
most
likely
because
their
memory
B
cells
—
which
produce
antibodies
—
had
many
months
to
evolve
before
vaccination.The
good
news
:
A
booster
vaccine
will
probably
have
the
same
effect
as
prior
infection
in
immunized
people
,
Dr.
Ellebedy
said
.
“
If
you
give
them
another
chance
to
engage
,
they
will
have
a
massive
response
,
”
he
said
,
referring
to
memory
B
cells.In
terms
of
bolstering
the
immune
system
,
vaccination
is
“
probably
better
”
than
recovering
from
the
actual
infection
,
he
said
.
Other
studies
have
suggested
that
the
repertoire
of
memory
B
cells
produced
after
vaccination
is
more
diverse
than
that
generated
by
infection
,
suggesting
that
the
vaccines
will
protect
better
against
variants
than
natural
immunity
alone.Dr
.
Ellebedy
said
the
results
also
suggested
that
these
signs
of
persistent
immune
reaction
might
be
caused
by
mRNA
vaccines
alone
,
as
opposed
to
those
made
by
more
traditional
means
,
like
Johnson
&
Johnson
’
s.But
that
is
an
unfair
comparison
,
because
the
Johnson
&
Johnson
vaccine
is
given
as
a
single
dose
,
Dr.
Iwasaki
said
:
“
If
the
J
&
J
had
a
booster
,
maybe
it
will
induce
this
same
kind
of
response.
”
Q
:
Almost
immediately
after
Gov
.
Cuomo
lifted
coronavirus
restrictions
,
my
Manhattan
co-op
ended
its
mask
requirement
in
common
areas
and
fully
reopened
the
gym
.
The
new
rules
say
that
people
who
are
not
fully
vaccinated
must
still
wear
a
mask
,
but
how
could
anyone
possibly
know
who
is
vaccinated
and
who
isn
’
t
?
Should
the
co-op
require
residents
to
show
their
vaccination
status
?
Should
the
board
ask
buyers
at
the
board
interview
if
they
’
ve
been
vaccinated
before
they
approve
them
to
live
in
the
building
?
A
:
Now
that
most
coronavirus
restrictions
have
been
lifted
,
many
buildings
are
relaxing
their
mask
rules
and
fully
reopening
their
gyms
.
While
people
who
are
not
fully
vaccinated
must
still
wear
masks
,
a
building
is
not
in
a
good
position
to
police
its
residents
.
“
This
is
all
based
on
the
honor
system
,
”
said
Dan
Wurtzel
,
the
president
of
FirstService
Residential
New
York
,
a
property
manager
.
“
We
’
re
not
in
the
business
of
keeping
medical
records.
”
Let
’
s
say
the
building
decided
to
have
the
doorman
ask
for
proof
of
vaccination
.
Those
residents
,
as
shareholders
of
the
co-op
,
are
actually
his
employers
.
What
if
they
refuse
to
answer
the
question
?
Or
lie
?
The
doorman
can
’
t
stop
them
from
going
to
their
apartment
.
“
I
don
’
t
think
people
want
to
put
the
doorman
in
that
position
,
”
said
Lisa
A.
Smith
,
a
real
estate
lawyer
and
a
partner
in
the
Manhattan
office
of
the
law
firm
Smith
,
Gambrell
&
Russell
.
“
They
’
re
not
bouncers
at
the
bar.
”
Theoretically
the
board
could
ask
buyers
at
a
board
interview
if
they
’
ve
been
vaccinated
,
but
the
candidates
could
avoid
answering
the
question
or
say
that
they
’
re
following
the
guidance
of
a
physician
.
Instead
,
you
will
have
to
make
your
own
decisions
about
how
safe
you
feel
stepping
into
the
lobby
or
the
gym
without
a
mask
on
.
It
’
s
not
unlike
whether
you
feel
safe
enough
going
to
Equinox
again
or
getting
on
the
subway
.
You
can
’
t
be
certain
if
the
person
next
to
you
is
vaccinated
.
If
you
don
’
t
feel
confident
in
your
surroundings
,
wear
your
mask.Some
co-ops
may
be
slower
to
loosen
their
rules
,
or
continue
to
require
visitors
and
vendors
(
like
nannies
and
housekeepers
)
to
wear
masks
in
common
areas
.
One
space
that
may
remain
closed
for
the
foreseeable
future
,
though
,
is
the
children
’
s
playroom
.
Children
under
12
are
still
not
eligible
for
any
vaccine
,
so
those
spaces
are
unlikely
to
reopen
in
the
near
future.With
an
outbreak
of
the
Delta
variant
spreading
rapidly
,
Australian
officials
on
Saturday
introduced
a
strict
two-week
lockdown
for
all
of
greater
Sydney
and
the
regions
surrounding
the
nation
’
s
largest
city.The
first
full-city
lockdown
for
Sydney
since
early
2020
reflects
a
sudden
rise
in
concern
among
officials
in
the
state
of
New
South
Wales
,
who
had
been
hoping
that
contact
tracers
and
targeted
isolation
would
be
enough
to
keep
the
more
contagious
variant
under
control.Instead
,
after
initially
resisting
a
full
lockdown
,
officials
said
on
Saturday
that
strict
citywide
stay-at-home
orders
were
necessary
because
they
had
found
several
additional
chains
of
transmission
around
the
city
among
people
who
had
been
infectious
for
days.Gladys
Berejiklian
,
the
state
premier
,
said
the
virus
was
simply
moving
too
quickly
through
the
population
.
Over
the
past
10
days
,
a
cluster
that
began
with
an
airport
limousine
driver
in
Sydney
,
a
city
of
five
million
,
has
jumped
to
nearly
100
cases
,
with
dozens
more
expected
over
the
coming
days.
“
We
don
’
t
want
to
impose
burdens
unless
we
absolutely
have
to
,
”
Ms.
Berejiklian
told
a
news
conference
on
Saturday
.
“
Unfortunately
,
we
have
to.
”
She
said
that
a
shorter
lockdown
would
not
be
enough
to
regain
control
over
transmission
,
describing
the
Delta
variant
as
spreading
far
faster
than
other
strains
of
the
coronavirus.
“
Unless
you
stay
a
step
ahead
of
this
virus
,
it
can
very
easily
get
out
of
control
,
”
she
said.Starting
at
6
p.m.
on
Saturday
,
people
across
the
Sydney
metropolitan
area
will
be
allowed
to
leave
their
homes
only
to
exercise
,
seek
medical
attention
,
care
for
loved
ones
,
buy
food
or
carry
out
other
essential
activities
.
The
lockdown
is
scheduled
to
end
on
July
9
,
but
could
be
extended.Australia
is
one
of
many
countries
throughout
the
Asia-Pacific
region
that
continue
to
struggle
with
the
ups
and
downs
of
the
coronavirus
,
mainly
because
of
new
variants
and
a
slow
rollout
of
vaccines
,
which
have
been
in
short
supply
outside
the
United
States
,
Europe
and
China.Health
officials
have
asked
for
extra
doses
from
Australia
’
s
federal
government
,
and
demand
for
the
vaccines
has
skyrocketed
after
months
of
complacency
.
But
most
people
in
Sydney
remain
unvaccinated
,
and
nationwide
,
fewer
than
a
quarter
of
Australians
have
received
even
one
dose
,
according
to
New
York
Times
data.Of
particular
concern
in
Sydney
are
a
hair
salon
that
saw
900
clients
while
at
least
a
few
employees
were
infectious
,
and
a
seafood
wholesaler
where
a
delivery
driver
tested
positive
after
several
days
of
transporting
fish
across
the
city.For
every
coronavirus
infection
that
was
recorded
in
the
United
States
in
mid-2020
,
nearly
five
asymptomatic
cases
went
undetected
,
according
to
a
new
study
by
the
National
Institutes
of
Health.The
study
,
which
was
released
on
Tuesday
,
reinforced
previous
findings
that
the
scope
of
contagion
was
much
more
widespread
in
the
early
months
of
the
pandemic.It
also
highlighted
the
vast
gap
in
virus
testing
in
many
parts
of
the
country
and
the
disproportionately
high
infection
rate
among
Black
people
at
the
time.N.I.H
.
researchers
estimated
that
there
were
as
many
as
20
million
infections
in
the
United
States
by
mid-July
2020
,
far
more
than
the
three
million
cases
that
public
health
authorities
recorded
.
Their
findings
were
based
on
a
yearlong
study
that
began
in
April
2020
,
with
researchers
analyzing
blood
samples
collected
from
more
than
8,000
people
,
mostly
from
early
May
through
July
31.The
study
,
published
online
in
Science
Translational
Medicine
,
looked
at
9,089
adults
who
had
not
been
diagnosed
with
Covid-19
and
found
that
about
4.6
percent
of
them
carried
antibodies
suggesting
that
they
had
been
infected
with
the
coronavirus
at
some
point
.
That
suggested
,
the
study
said
,
“
a
potential
16.8
million
undiagnosed
infections
by
July
2020
in
addition
to
the
reported
3
million
diagnosed
cases
in
the
United
States.
”
Data
released
last
summer
by
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
similarly
detailed
a
vast
undercounting
of
infections.The
new
study
“
helps
account
for
how
quickly
the

spread
to
all
corners
of
the
country
and
the
globe
,
”
Bruce
J.
Tromberg
,
director
of
the
National
Institute
of
Biomedical
Imaging
and
Bioengineering
,
said
in
a
statement
.
The
institute
is
one
of
several
at
N.I.H
.
whose
scientists
are
leading
the
effort
to
study
the
transmission
of
the
virus
,
and
it
contributed
to
the
report.Dr
.
Tromberg
said
that
the
findings
would
help
public
health
experts
assess
future
measures
to
protect
people
from
the
coronavirus
and
from
emerging
,
more
transmissible
variants
.
They
also
would
provide
more
clarity
for
scientists
who
are
tracking
vaccine
antibody-response
changes
over
time
,
he
said.Among
those
who
volunteered
for
the
study
,
which
was
weighted
for
race
and
other
factors
,
Black
participants
had
the
highest
estimated
rate
of
coronavirus
antibodies
in
their
blood
(
14.2
percent
)
,
more
than
five
times
the
rate
for
white
participants
(
2.5
percent
)
.Researchers
also
found
that
the
seropositivity
rate
was
higher
in
females
than
in
males
,
and
for
the
study
’
s
youngest
participants
,
ranging
in
age
from
18
to
44.
“
This
wide
gap
between
the
known
cases
at
the
time
and
these
asymptomatic
infections
has
implications
not
only
for
retrospectively
understanding
this
pandemic
but
for
future
pandemic
preparedness
,
”
Kaitlyn
Sadtler
,
a
top
N.I.H
.
official
and
a
senior
co-author
of
the
study
,
said
in
a
statement.A
third
dose
of
the
Covid-19
vaccine
developed
by
AstraZeneca
and
the
University
of
Oxford
generated
a
strong
immune
response
in
clinical
trial
volunteers
,
Oxford
researchers
reported
on
Monday.The
finding
indicates
that
the
AstraZeneca
vaccine
could
be
an
option
should
third
shots
end
up
being
needed
,
for
example
to
extend
immunity
.
To
date
,
the
vaccine
has
been
given
as
two
doses
,
typically
between
four
and
12
weeks
apart.The
new
data
,
detailed
in
a
preprint
manuscript
that
has
not
yet
been
peer
reviewed
,
came
from
90
study
volunteers
in
Britain
who
were
among
the
earliest
to
receive
the
shots
in
a
clinical
trial
last
year
.
This
past
March
,
they
were
given
a
third
dose
,
roughly
30
weeks
after
their
second.Laboratory
analyses
showed
that
the
third
dose
increased
levels
of
antibodies
to
the
virus
in
the
volunteers
to
a
point
higher
than
seen
a
month
after
their
second
dose
—
an
encouraging
sign
that
the
third
shot
would
be
likely
to
bring
greater
protection
if
the
effectiveness
of
two
doses
waned
over
time.
“
We
do
have
to
be
in
a
position
where
we
could
boost
if
it
turned
out
that
was
necessary
,
”
Prof.
Andrew
Pollard
,
an
Oxford
researcher
who
has
led
studies
of
the
vaccine
,
said
in
a
news
conference
on
Monday
.
“
I
think
we
have
encouraging
data
in
this
preprint
to
show
that
boosters
could
be
used
and
would
be
effective
at
boosting
the
immune
response.
”
Scientists
and
policymakers
do
not
yet
know
whether
booster
shots
may
be
needed
.
Researchers
are
hopeful
that
the
protection
conferred
by
the
leading
vaccines
will
last
at
least
a
year
,
but
there
is
not
yet
evidence
to
know
for
sure.Emerging
coronavirus
variants
could
also
accelerate
the
need
for
booster
shots
.
If
third
shots
are
deemed
necessary
in
the
coming
months
,
their
availability
could
be
severely
limited
,
especially
in
poorer
countries
that
are
lacking
enough
supply
to
give
first
doses
to
their
most
vulnerable
citizens.Earlier
this
month
,
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
announced
that
it
has
begun
a
new
clinical
trial
of
people
fully
vaccinated
with
any
of
the
three
authorized
vaccines
in
the
United
States
.
The
goal
is
test
whether
a
booster
shot
of
the
vaccine
made
by
Moderna
will
increase
their
antibodies
against
the
virus
.
Initial
results
are
expected
later
this
summer.The
AstraZeneca
vaccine
has
won
authorization
in
80
countries
since
last
December
but
is
not
approved
for
use
in
the
United
States
,
which
already
has
more
than
enough
doses
of
its
three
authorized
vaccines
to
meet
demand
.
The
shot
has
been
the
backbone
of
the
struggling
Covax
program
to
provide
vaccines
to
poor
countries
,
accounting
for
more
than
88
percent
of
the
doses
shipped
out
to
middle-
and
low-income
nations
through
last
week.AstraZeneca
announced
on
Sunday
that
the
first
volunteers
had
been
vaccinated
in
a
separate
study
assessing
a
new
version
of
the
vaccine
designed
to
protect
against
the
Beta
variant
of
the
virus
first
seen
in
South
Africa
.
Some
study
results
suggested
that
the
original
version
of
the
AstraZeneca
vaccine
may
not
be
effective
against
that
variant
.
Professor
Pollard
said
the
study
would
compare
the
effects
of
a
third
dose
of
the
original
vaccine
against
those
of
boosting
volunteers
with
the
new
Beta-targeted
vaccine.Bangladesh
will
return
to
national
lockdown
by
the
end
of
the
week
,
responding
to
a
wave
of
infections
that
on
Monday
brought
its
highest
single-day
death
toll
of
the
pandemic
so
far.The
looming
restrictions
,
imposed
in
a
series
of
steps
,
have
sent
tens
of
thousands
of
migrant
laborers
in
Dhaka
,
the
capital
and
largest
city
,
scrambling
to
get
to
their
villages
in
scenes
reminiscent
of
neighboring
India
’
s
migrant
exodus
last
year.The
garment
industry
,
which
employs
4.5
million
people
and
makes
up
80
percent
of
the
country
’
s
exports
,
will
remain
open
.
But
other
businesses
were
instructed
to
limit
their
operations
to
minimum
levels
of
required
staffing
,
and
almost
all
public
transportation
systems
are
either
closing
or
already
closed.Residents
of
Dhaka
expect
to
be
largely
confined
to
their
homes
after
Thursday
,
the
first
day
of
what
the
government
has
called
a
“
hard
lockdown
,
”
though
how
strictly
the
measures
will
be
implemented
remains
to
be
seen
.
The
government
has
said
the
army
,
police
,
and
border
guard
will
be
deployed
for
strict
enforcement.Bangladesh
had
slowed
the
spread
of
the
virus
with
sporadic
restrictions
and
reduced
movement
while
trying
to
keep
much
of
the
economy
open
.
But
a
fast-spreading
wave
now
,
with
barely
3
percent
of
the
population
vaccinated
,
has
forced
officials
to
take
more
drastic
measures.The
country
reported
119
deaths
on
Monday
,
the
highest
daily
toll
since
the
pandemic
began
,
while
the
test
positivity
rate
was
over
20
percent
.
Bangladesh
has
officially
reported
a
total
of
nearly
900,000
infections
and
14,172
deaths
from
the
virus
,
though
experts
believe
the
true
numbers
are
much
higher.The
current
lockdown
has
been
gradual
.
The
government
stopped
trains
and
long
distance
buses
last
week
.
It
also
imposed
lockdowns
in
seven
districts
surrounding
Dhaka
,
aiming
to
avert
a
surge
there
.
Shopping
malls
are
closed
,
and
restaurants
are
limited
to
takeout
orders
only.The
full
lockdown
,
initially
expected
to
last
one
week
,
begins
on
Thursday
.
All
transportation
systems
except
for
auto-rickshaws
will
be
shut.The
government
has
instructed
garment
factory
owners
to
arrange
transportation
for
their
workers
during
previous
rounds
of
restrictions
.
When
the
public
transportation
was
shut
in
April
to
slow
the
spread
of
the
virus
,
factory
owners
who
did
not
arrange
transportation
were
accused
of
violating
the
order
,
and
workers
had
to
walk
for
miles
twice
a
day
to
get
to
work.As
the
latest
lockdown
approached
,
ferry
stations
in
Dhaka
have
been
swamped
by
people
trying
to
cross
the
river
to
the
southern
districts.LONDON
—
Britain
’
s
embattled
health
minister
,
Matt
Hancock
,
resigned
on
Saturday
,
a
day
after
a
tabloid
newspaper
published
photos
of
him
in
a
steamy
embrace
with
one
of
his
senior
aides
—
an
apparent
violation
of
Britain
’
s
social-distancing
guidelines.Mr
.
Hancock
,
who
spearheaded
Britain
’
s
response
to
the
coronavirus
pandemic
,
was
the
latest
member
of
Prime
Minister
Boris
Johnson
’
s
government
to
be
accused
of
violating
the
strict
rules
imposed
on
the
rest
of
the
country.
“
I
understand
the
enormous
sacrifices
that
everybody
in
this
country
has
made
—
that
you
have
made
,
”
a
chastened-looking
Mr.
Hancock
said
in
a
video
statement
released
on
Saturday
evening
.
“
Those
of
us
who
make
these
rules
have
got
to
stick
by
them
,
and
that
’
s
why
I
’
ve
got
to
resign.
”
Initially
,
Mr.
Hancock
refused
to
step
down
and
had
the
backing
of
Mr.
Johnson
.
But
with
at
least
one
Conservative
member
of
Parliament
demanding
his
resignation
,
and
newspapers
full
of
stories
about
double
standards
for
the
political
elite
,
Mr.
Hancock
concluded
his
position
had
become
untenable.In
a
letter
to
the
prime
minister
,
Mr.
Hancock
wrote
,
“
The
last
thing
I
would
want
is
for
my
private
life
to
distract
attention
from
the
single-minded
focus
that
is
leading
us
out
of
this
crisis.
”
Mr.
Hancock
,
who
is
married
,
apologized
to
his
family
and
said
he
needed
to
be
with
his
three
children.Mr
.
Johnson
appointed
Sajid
Javid
,
a
former
chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
to
replace
Mr.
Hancock.It
was
a
swift
fall
from
grace
for
an
ambitious
,
42-year-old
cabinet
minister
,
who
had
become
a
familiar
figure
over
the
long
months
of
the
pandemic
.
Mr.
Hancock
was
a
fixture
at
Downing
Street
news
conferences
,
often
exhorting
the
public
to
abide
by
lockdowns
and
other
restrictions
to
try
to
curb
the
spread
of
the
virus.In
the
end
,
Mr.
Hancock
’
s
failure
to
live
by
his
own
rules
undid
him
.
The
Sun
published
images
—
and
later
video
—
from
a
surveillance
camera
in
Mr.
Hancock
’
s
office
that
showed
him
embracing
and
kissing
Gina
Coladangelo
,
a
friend
from
college
days
at
Oxford
whom
he
had
recruited
as
an
adviser.Newspapers
reported
that
the
images
were
recorded
on
May
6
,
when
the
restrictions
in
England
still
banned
indoor
social
gatherings
of
people
from
different
households
.
People
were
urged
to
stay
two
meters
apart
and
avoid
“
face-to-face
contact.
”
Those
restrictions
have
since
been
relaxed.Mr
.
Hancock
acknowledged
that
he
had
breached
the
rules
.
On
Friday
,
he
said
he
was
“
very
sorry
”
and
had
“
let
people
down.
”
Downing
Street
initially
said
the
prime
minister
had
accepted
Mr.
Hancock
’
s
apology
and
considered
the
matter
closed.Even
before
he
was
engulfed
by
scandal
,
Mr.
Hancock
had
become
something
of
a
lightning
rod
for
controversy
.
Two
weeks
ago
,
a
former
chief
adviser
to
Mr.
Johnson
,
Dominic
Cummings
,
posted
text
messages
between
him
and
the
prime
minister
in
which
Mr.
Johnson
described
Mr.
Hancock
as
“
hopeless
,
”
adding
a
profanity.Mr
.
Cummings
pinned
much
of
the
blame
for
Britain
’
s
chaotic
handling
of
the
pandemic
on
Mr.
Hancock
,
saying
he
had
failed
to
set
up
a
competent
test-and-trace
program
and
allowed
the
spread
of
the
virus
by
moving
elderly
people
from
hospitals
to
nursing
homes
.
Mr.
Hancock
flatly
denied
the
charges.Mr
.
Cummings
himself
came
under
fire
a
year
ago
for
driving
260
miles
to
visit
his
parents
in
the
north
of
England
while
the
country
was
under
a
lockdown
.
He
,
too
,
refused
to
step
down
,
and
lasted
another
six
months
before
Mr.
Johnson
ousted
him.The
Labour
Party
,
which
has
tried
to
make
a
political
issue
of
the
scandals
in
Mr.
Johnson
’
s
government
,
faulted
him
for
not
acting
faster
in
this
latest
episode
.
“
Matt
Hancock
is
right
to
resign
,
”
the
Labour
leader
,
Keir
Starmer
,
said
on
Twitter
.
“
But
Boris
Johnson
should
have
sacked
him.
”
There
are
other
lingering
questions
.
One
concerns
the
circumstances
of
Mr.
Hancock
’
s
hiring
of
Ms.
Coladangelo
,
who
is
also
married
,
as
a
non-executive
director
in
the
health
department
.
She
had
previously
worked
for
a
fashion
retailer
,
Oliver
Bonas
,
founded
by
her
husband
,
Oliver
Tress.Another
concerns
the
placement
of
a
surveillance
camera
in
Mr.
Hancock
’
s
office
.
Some
experts
suggested
it
could
have
been
done
clandestinely
to
catch
the
minister
in
his
private
entanglements.When
the
news
of
Mr.
Hancock
’
s
indiscretions
broke
on
Friday
,
political
analysts
said
he
might
survive
the
furor
because
he
worked
for
Mr.
Johnson
,
who
has
had
his
own
messy
private
life
and
was
recently
married
for
the
third
time.In
a
letter
accepting
Mr.
Hancock
’
s
resignation
,
Mr.
Johnson
credited
him
with
building
a
network
of
field
hospitals
to
handle
the
flood
of
Covid
patients
;
deploying
the
drug
dexamethasone
to
mitigate
the
effects
of
Covid
;
and
securing
protective
gear
for
doctors
and
nurses.
“
It
has
been
your
task
to
deal
with
a
challenge
greater
than
that
faced
by
any
of
your
predecessors
,
”
Mr.
Johnson
wrote
,
“
and
in
fighting
Covid
,
you
have
risen
to
that
challenge.

For
every
coronavirus
infection
that
was
recorded
in
the
United

nearly
five

,
reinforced
previous
findings
that
the
scope
of
contagion
was
much
more
widespread
in
the
early
months
of
the
pandemic.It
also
highlighted
the
vast
gap
in
virus
testing
in
many
parts
of
the
country
and
the
disproportionately
high
infection
rate
among
Black
people
at

estimated
that
there
were

by
mid-July
2020
,
far
more
than
the
three
million
cases
that

recorded
.
Their
findings
were
based
on
a

study
that
began
in

said

,
Nepal
—
In
April
at
Mount
Everest
base
camp
,
where
climbers
acclimatize
to
the
extreme
altitude
before
heading
to
the
summit
of
the
world
’
s
highest
peak
,
Jangbu
Sherpa
fell
ill
with
a
cough
and
fever.At
17,590
feet
,
his
symptoms
quickly
worsened
.
The
expedition
company
that
had
hired
Mr.
Sherpa
to
help
a
Bahraini
prince
climb
Everest
had
him
airlifted
to
a
hospital
in
the
capital
,
Kathmandu
,
where
he
tested
positive
for
the
coronavirus.He
spent
a
week
at
the
hospital
and
six
days
at
home
,
and
then
was
back
at
base
camp
.
Experienced
guides
like
him
from
Nepal
’
s
high-mountain-dwelling
Sherpa
community
were
in
short
supply
because
of
the
pandemic
,
and
the
expedition
company
stood
to
lose
thousands
of
dollars
if
the
prince
’
s
climb
were
canceled.So
,
with
his
body
still
fighting
the
vestiges
of
the
virus
,
Mr.
Sherpa
,
38
,
most
likely
became
the
first
person
with
Covid-19
to
stand
on
Everest
’
s
pinnacle
when
he
led
the
prince
and
15
others
there
at
dawn
on
May
11
.
By
the
end
of
the
climbing
season
early
this
month
,
at
least
59
infected
people
had
been
on
the
mountain
,
including
five
others
who
reached
the
top
,
according
to
interviews
with
climbers
and
expedition
companies
and
the
personal
accounts
of
social

users.
“
Were
Sherpas

”
said
Ang
Tshering
Sherpa
,

Association
.
“
This
issue
deserves
in-depth
research.
”
But
according
to
the
Nepal
government
,
there
was
never
any
Covid-19
on
Everest
.
Tourism
officials
dismissed
the
accounts
of
climbers
,
calling
one
a
pneumonia
patient
.
Coughing
,
they
added
,
is
nothing
new
in
the
dry

air.Nepal
’

tourism
department
,
which
oversees

,
maintained
this
position
even
as
people
were
being
airlifted
off
the
mountain
and
expeditions
were
being
canceled
—
a
rare
event
because
of
the
great
expense
and
effort
made
to
train
,
travel
to
Nepal
and
try
to
summit

,
a

Erlend

,
one
of
the
world
’
s
poorest
countries
,
has
been
struggling
with
a
dire
coronavirus
outbreak
and
a
shortage
of
vaccines
.
Few
Sherpas
or
other
Nepalis
had
access
to
vaccines
while
the
climbing
season
was
underway
;
even
now
,
as
the
government
pleads
with
wealthy
nations
for
doses
,
less
than
3
percent
of
the
population
has
been
fully
inoculated.Officials
had
strong
incentives
to
play
down
the
Covid
situation
on
Everest
.
Nepal
closed
its
peaks
in
2020
because
of
the
pandemic
,
after
bringing
in
more
than
$
2
billion
from
climbing
and
trekking
in
2019
.
If
the
Covid-19
cases
were
publicized
,
it
could
tarnish
Nepal
’
s
image
as
a
tourist
destination
,
and
invite
climbers
whose
expeditions
were
canceled
to
demand
extensions
of
their
climbing
permits.Still
,
with
this
year
’
s
climbing
season
now
over
,
more
expedition
agencies
are
acknowledging
that
Covid-19
infections
were
rampant
in
the
crowded
base
camp
,
which
drew
a
record
408
foreign
climbers
this
year
.
The
true
number
of
cases
could
be
far
higher
than
59
,
since
expedition
organizers
,
doctors
and
climbers
themselves
said
they
were
pressured
to
hide
infections.The
Nepal
government
had
made
some
preparation
to
avoid
infections
on
the
mountain
.
It
instituted
testing
,
mask
and
social-distancing
requirements
,
stationed
medical
personnel
at
the
Everest
base
camp
and
had
helicopters
ready
to
swoop
in
and
pick
up
infected
climbers.Expedition
companies
,
which
often
bring
their
own
medical
personnel
,
also
packed
antigen
kits
,
testing
members
of
their
groups
regularly
and
isolating
anyone
who
tested
positive.Given
that
all
climbers
had
to
test
negative
before
starting
the
trek
to
base
camp
,
it
is
likely
that
most
of
those
with
Covid-19
became
infected
while
on
the
mountain
,
though
it
is
possible
that
some
arrived
with
infections
that
were
not
initially
detected.There
were
compelling
reasons
for
expedition
companies
to
proceed
with
climbs
,
even
as
the
first
coronavirus
cases
were
reported
at
base
camp
from
the
last
week
of

to

,
allowing
their

to

for
a

to
make

almost
half

“

Mr.

learned
of
his
infection
only
after
testing
positive
days
later
in
Kathmandu
,
where
his
expedition
company
quarantined
him
at
a
hotel
for
12
days
.
His

he
was
still

bout
with

was
airlifted
from

to

hospital
in
Kathmandu
.
Doctors
advised
him
not
to
return
to
the
mountain
,
so
he
flew
home
to
Norway
.
The
Everest
expedition
had
taken
three
years
to
plan
and
cost
him
$
40,000
,
plus
hospital
fees
in
Nepal
.
He
does
not
expect
to
get
any
money
back.Mario
Celinic
of
Croatia
said
he
tested
positive
at
Everest
base

.
He
had
trained
for
Everest
for
four
years
,
climbing
some
of
the
world
’
s
other
highest
peaks
.
Suffering
no
symptoms
,
he
decided
to
proceed
to
the
top.
“
‘
You
have
Covid
and
you
must
be
careful
,
’
this
came
into
my
mind
,
because
Covid
affects
the
lungs
and
that
would
be
difficult
to
breathe
above
8,000
meters
’
altitude
,
”
he
said.
“
That
mountain
is
like
a
beautiful
flower
that
will
kill
you
anytime
.
It
attracts
you
.
You
must
come
,
you
are
admired
.
And
when
you
go
up
to
8,000
meters
,
you
are
completely
helpless

Singh
Tamang
,
the
director
general
of

department

said
he
had
no
information
about
Mr.
Furtenbach
’
s
appeal
or
those
of
other
expedition
agencies
sent
to
his
office
to
extend
climbing
permits.
“
We
can
’
t
just
extend
climbing
permits
on
basis
of
Covid
rumors
,
”
Mr.
Tamang
said.
“
Whether
their
expeditions
were
canceled
because
of
Covid-19
or
not
,
that
should
be
examined
,
”
he
said.With
very
few
Sherpas
having
been
vaccinated
when
they
arrived
at
base
camp
,
dozens
contracted
Covid-19
.
Some
were
airlifted
out
.
Others
isolated
in
their
pup
tents
and
climbed
to
higher
camps
after
recovering.Phunuru
Sherpa
of
International
Mountain
Guides
said
10
Sherpa
guides
on
his
team
fell
sick
with
Covid-19.Of
the
more
than
400
foreign
climbers
attempting
to
scale
Everest
,
almost
half
abandoned
their
expeditions
,
either
because
of
Covid-19
infections
or
because
of
a
cyclone
that
caused
snowstorms
in
the
Himalayas.Scott
Simper
,
a
climber
from
Utah
who
lives
in
New
Zealand
,
reached
Everest
’
s
peak
on
May
11
,
according
to
his
wife
,
Anna
Keeling
,
a
mountain
guide.
“
He
didn
’
t
know
he
had
Covid
on
the
mountain
,
”
she
said
.
Mr.
Simper
learned
of
his
infection
only
after
testing
positive
days
later
in
Kathmandu
,
where
his
expedition
company
quarantined
him
at
a
hotel
for
12
days
.
His
wife
said
he
was
still
recovering
from
the
disease.Mr
.
Ness
,
the
Norwegian
climber
who
described
his
bout
with
Covid-19
on
social
media
,
was
airlifted
from
base
camp
to
a
hospital
in
Kathmandu
.
Doctors
advised
him
not
to
return
to
the
mountain
,
so
he
flew
home
to
Norway
.
The
Everest
expedition
had
taken
three
years
to
plan
and
cost
him
$
40,000
,
plus
hospital
fees
in
Nepal
.
He
does
not
expect
to
get
any
money
back.Mario
Celinic
of
Croatia
said
he
tested
positive
at
Everest
base
camp
.
He
had
trained
for
Everest
for
four
years
,
climbing
some
of
the
world
’
s
other
highest
peaks
.
Suffering
no
symptoms
,
he
decided
to
proceed
to
the
top.
“
‘
You
have
Covid
and
you
must
be
careful
,
’
this
came
into
my
mind
,
because
Covid
affects
the
lungs
and
that
would
be
difficult
to
breathe
above
8,000
meters
’
altitude
,
”
he
said.
“
That
mountain
is
like
a
beautiful
flower
that
will
kill
you
anytime
.
It
attracts
you
.
You
must
come
,
you
are
admired
.
And
when
you
go
up
to
8,000
meters
,
you
are
completely
helpless
.
Whatever
the
mountain
decides
,
that
will
be
your
fate
,
”
Mr.
Celinic
said.Like
many
states
in
the
South
,
Louisiana
’
s
vaccination
rate
has
lagged
significantly
behind
the
national
average
,
particularly
among
older
adults
,
a
trend
that
has
troubled
public
health
officials.Some
22
percent
of
adults
65
and
older
still
have
not
been
vaccinated
,
compared
with
12
percent
nationally
,
according
to
a
New
York
Times
database
.
Just
34
percent
of
the
state
’
s
population
has
been
fully
vaccinated
,
compared
with
46
percent
nationally.Louisiana
is
one
of
the
latest
states
to
resort
to
dangling
financial
incentives
to
get
more
shots
into
arms
,
a
strategy
that
has
kindled
a
broader
debate
over
the
effectiveness
and
wisdom
of
monetary
enticements
.
It
is
holding
a
lottery
,
which
will
be
paid
for
with
federal
coronavirus
relief
funds.At
the
lottery
’
s
unveiling
last
week
,
a
jazz
band
played
the
state
song
,
“
You
Are
My
Sunshine
,
”
and
Louisiana
’
s
governor
,
John
Bel
Edwards
,
revealed
a
giant
check
for
$
1
million.Mr
.
Edwards
said
amid
the
festivities
that
the
money
would
go
to
a
Louisiana
adult
who
had
received
at
least
one
dose
of
a
Covid-19
vaccine
.
He
said
that
the
state
would
give
away
a
total
of
$
2.3
million
in
cash
prizes
and
scholarships
over
a
month
.
Registration
for
the
lottery
—
marketed
as
“
Shot
at
a
Million
”
—
began
this
week.
“
Before
launching
our
own
program
,
we
wanted
to
see
how
well
it
worked
in
other
states
,
and
,
quite
frankly
,
we
’
ve
been
impressed
by
the
success
that
they
’
ve
had
,
”
Mr.
Edwards
said
in
announcing
the
lottery.Louisiana
’
s
vaccination
rate
,
as
a
share
of
its
population
,
is
lower
than
every
state
but
Mississippi
.
Six
of
the
bottom
eight
states
are
in
the
South
:
They
include
Alabama
,
Arkansas
,
Georgia
and
Tennessee.The
Biden
administration
has
made
a
concerted
push
to
overcome
vaccine
hesitancy
,
particularly
in
the
South
.
This
week
,
the
first
lady
,
Jill
Biden
,
visited
Tennessee
and
Mississippi
to
encourage
people
to
get
vaccinated
,
while
President
Biden
visited
a
mobile
vaccination
site
in
North
Carolina
on
Thursday.Gov
.
Mike
DeWine
of
Ohio
announced
in
May
that
five
people
would
each
win
$
1
million
;
the
last
winners
were
announced
on
Wednesday
.
On
Thursday
,
Mr.
DeWine
said
the
state
would
focus
on
smaller
incentives
,
like
$
25
DoorDash
gift
cards
at
select
locations
,
and
on
expanding
outreach
and
access
to
shots.
“
We
want
our
people
to
be
protected
,
”
Mr.
Edwards
said
.
“
This
is
the
way
that
we
accomplish
that
.
It
is
the
way
we
can
make
sure
that
we
return
to
normalcy
and
are
able
to
safely
gather.

Dr

A
.
Mark
Fendrick
,
the
director
of
the
University
of
Michigan
Center
for
Value-Based
Insurance
Design
,
said
in
an
interview
that
there
was
a
compelling
case
for
conducting
lotteries
but
that
they
should
be
open
only
to
people
who
were
fully
vaccinated.
“
The
people
that
we
need
to
reach
to
get
vaccinated
,
independent
of
their
political
affiliation
,
have
been
shown
to
be
those
populations
who
are
likely
to
buy
lottery
tickets
,
”
he
said.Dr
.
Fendrick
,
a
primary-care
physician
who
has
studied
consumer
incentives
for
health
care
behavior
for
three
decades
,
said
it
was
too
early
to
determine
the
effectiveness
of
the
lotteries
.
In
some
states
,
he
said
,
the
lotteries
coincided
with
making
the
vaccine
available
to
teenagers
,
which
could
skew
the
numbers
.
He
suggested
comparing
the
vaccination
rates
in
states
with
lotteries
to
those
without
them.
“
I
really
want
to
see
Michigan
versus
Ohio
,
”
he
said.On
Wednesday
,
North
Carolina
held
its
first
lottery
drawing
as
part
of
a
similar
vaccination
push
.
Every
other
week
,
it
will
give
away
$
1
million
and
a
$
125,000
scholarship
to
an
adult
and
a
teenager
who
get
the
vaccine.Similar
initiatives
have
been
promoted
by
California
,
Illinois
,
Maryland
,
New
Mexico
and
Washington.In
Oregon
,
however
,
the
pace
of
vaccinations
slipped
since
May
,
when
Gov
.
Kate
Brown
announced
a
$
1
million
giveaway
,
The
Oregonian
reported
this
month.Charles
Boyle
,
a
spokesman
for
Ms.
Brown
,
said
in
an
email
on
Tuesday
night
that
the
drop-off
in
vaccinations
was
to
be
expected
as
more
residents
had
the
shot
.
Oregon
,
he
said
,
needed
to
inoculate
less
than
42,000
people
to
reach
its
target
of
at
least
70
percent
of
adults
having
received
at
least
one
shot.Mr
.
Boyle
said
that
the
“
Take
Your
Shot
,
Oregon
”
campaign
was
part
of
a
broader
strategy
that
included
using
more
and
smaller
vaccine
clinics
to
lift
the
vaccination
rate.
“
No
individual
strategy
is
expected
to
have
a
singularly
massive
impact
or
to
wholly
reverse
vaccination
rate
trends
,
”
he
said
.
“
Each
strategy
adds
a
little
energy
to
the
overall
effort.
”
The
Mountain
West
has
emerged
as
one
of
the
most
vaccine-hesitant
regions
of
the
United
States
.
Along
with
the
South
,
it
is
lagging
far
behind
the
national
vaccination
pace.In
both
Idaho
and
Wyoming
,
fewer
than
40
percent
of
people
have
received
at
least
one
dose
so
far
,
ranking
those
states
among
the
bottom
five
in
the
nation
,
according
to
a
New
York
Times
database
.
Montana
,
Utah
and
Nevada
are
doing
a
bit
better
,
but
remain
well
below
the
national
average
of
54
percent
.
None
of
the
five
states
is
on
track
to
meet
President
Biden
’
s
goal
of
at
least
partly
vaccinating
70
percent
of
adults
by
July
4
,
and
the
White
House
acknowledged
this
week
that
the
president
doesn
’
t
expect
the
nation
as
a
whole
to
meet
that
target.Health
officials
in
the
region
say
that
their
efforts
have
been
hampered
by
sparse
populations
in
their
wide-open
areas
and
by
the
deep-rooted
brand
of
political
conservatism
that
is
common
among
rural
residents
.
But
there
is
more
to
the
story
than
that.As
in
other
parts
of
the
country
,
the
unvaccinated
in
the
Mountain
West
can
be
divided
largely
into
two
camps
,
experts
say.
“
There
are
those
who
are
kind
of
the
wait-and-see
folks
,
and
then
we
have
the
absolutely
,
definitely
not
,
”
said
Greg
Holzman
,
who
was
Montana
’
s
state
medical
officer
until
April
.
Rampant
misinformation
makes
it
difficult
to
change
minds
,
he
said
,
and
so
does
the
logistical
difficulty
of
providing
convenient
access
in
small
,
widely
scattered
communities.There
are
crosscurrents
beneath
the
statewide
trends
.
For
example
,
Native
Americans
in
Montana
,
after
some
initial
hesitancy
,
have
embraced
the
vaccines
while
white
residents
in
rural
areas
have
been
less
accepting.Garfield
County
,
in
eastern
Montana
,
illustrates
some
of
what
health
officials
are
up
against
.
The
county
was
the
scene
of
a
lengthy
standoff
in
1996
between
the
F.B.I
.
and
an
anti-government
militia
called
the
Montana
Freemen
.
These
days
,
“
the
life
philosophy
is
pretty
much
the
same
,
and
that
’
s
no
government
intervention
,
no
way
,
no
how
,
”
said
Dr.
Randall
Rauh
,
medical
director
of
the
Garfield
County
Health
Center
,
a
critical
access
facility
and
nursing
home.Just
21
percent
of
eligible
county
residents
have
been
fully
vaccinated
,
the
lowest
rate
in
Montana
,
according
to
state
figures.Dr
.
Rauh
said
that
after
the
center
vaccinated
all
of
its
nursing
home
residents
,
he
was
accused
by
an
employee
of
experimenting
on
old
people
,
and
the
facility
received
little
support
from
local
officials
.
The
county
health
department
will
administer
vaccine
doses
only
when
10
or
more
people
show
up
to
get
them
,
Dr.
Rauh
said
,
so
“
it
’
s
very
difficult
for
people
unless
they
can
make
the
trip
to
a
surrounding
county
to
get
vaccinated.
”
In
Utah
,
home
to
the
Church
of
Jesus
Christ
of
Latter-day
Saints
,
the
church
’
s
leadership
has
voiced
strong
support
for
vaccination
.
Even
so
,
a
recent
survey
found
that
about
half
of
Mormon
respondents
were
hesitant
or
unwilling
to
get
vaccinated.Misinformation
appears
to
be
a
factor
among
Mormon
women
,
in
a
state
with
one
of
the
nation
’
s
highest
birthrates
,
said
Dr.
Emily
Spivak
,
an
infectious
diseases
specialist
at
the
University
of
Utah
Hospital
in
Salt
Lake
City
.
“
I
’
ve
had
a
lot
of
questions
about
fertility
”
and
whether
the
vaccines
affect
menstruation
,
she
said
.
There
is
no
current
evidence
that
the
vaccines
impact
fertility.Idaho
tends
to
have
lower
immunization
rates
in
general
,
according
to
Maggie
Mann
,
the
district
director
for
Southeastern
Idaho
Public
Health
.
Many
people
have
told
her
that
their
schedules
are
too
busy
to
fit
in
the
appointment.The
eight
counties
Ms.
Mann
oversees
are
dotted
with
communities
that
have
not
been
severely
hit
by
the
pandemic
,
she
said
,
and
“
it
’
s
hard
for
people
when
they
haven
’
t
been
personally
affected
to
be
highly
motivated
to
get
that
vaccine.
”
Only
one
county
in
Nevada
has
fully
vaccinated
more
than
half
of
its
residents
12
and
older
,
according
to
the
Times
database
.
Experts
say
many
people
in
the
state
’
s
rural
areas
simply
do
not
see
the
need.Matthew
Walker
,
chief
executive
of
William
Bee
Ririe
Critical
Access
Hospital
and
Rural
Health
Clinics
in
Ely
,
Nev.
,
said
that
health
care
workers
try
to
win
over
skeptics
by
appealing
to
their
sense
of
self-reliance.
“
We
try
to
really
push
that
if
you
get
sick
,
regardless
whether
it
’
s
the
flu
or
Covid
,
and
you
have
to
be
laid
up
in
bed
for
a
few
days
,
or
worse
,
what
’
s
going
to
happen
?
”
he
said
.
“
You
can
’
t
take
care
of
yourself
,
you
’
re
an
hour
or
two
away
from
a
medical
facility
,
you
’
ve
got
kids
or
family
—
who
’
s
going
to
take
care
of
your
ranch
?
And
oftentimes
,
that
will
get
people.

PARIS
—
Secretary
of
State
Antony
J.
Blinken
,
speaking
in
an
interview
after
a
meeting
with
President
Emmanuel
Macron
of
France
,
said
the
United
States
and
France
were
“
on
the
same
page
”
in
their
determination
to
resist
the
possibility
of
a
Chinese-led
world
order
that
would
be
“
profoundly
illiberal
in
nature.
”
On
his
first
visit
as
secretary
to
France
,
where
he
lived
for
nine
years
in
his
youth
and
attended
high
school
,
Mr.
Blinken
said
“
our
purpose
is
not
to
contain
China
”
or
“
try
to
hold
China
back.
”
But
when
it
comes
to
defending
a
free
and
open
international
order
,
“
we
will
stand
up.
”
The
alternative
,
he
suggested
,
was
either
no
order
—
a
world
of
chaos
that
“
inevitably
leads
to
conflict
and
that
almost
inevitably
brings
us
in
”
—
or
Chinese
domination
.
The
challenge
for
democracies
was
“
to
deliver
for
their
people
and
hopefully
for
people
around
the
world
”
in
order
to
reinforce
a
model
challenged
in
recent
years
by
its
own
internal
fractures
and
by
rising
autocracies.
“
And
I
found
that
President
Macron
was
thinking
in
exactly
the
same
way
and
focused
on
the
need
to
bring
practical
results
,
”
Mr.
Blinken
said.Mr
.
Blinken
’
s
pleasure
at
being
back
in
France
was
evident
.
At
a
meeting
earlier
in
the
day
,
France
’
s
foreign
minister
,
Jean-Yves
Le
Drian
,
greeted
the
secretary
as
“
My
dear
Tony
”
and
said
,
“
Welcome
home.
”
Asked
about
this
,
Mr.
Blinken
said
,
“
Oh
yes
,
it
is
a
sacred
home
for
me
.
I
was
here
from
age
9
to
18
.
I
had
a
life-changing
experience.
”
Having
said
Thursday
in
Berlin
that
the
United
States
has
“
no
better
friend
in
the
world
than
Germany
,
”
he
said
he
would
say
the
same
thing
about
France
.
As
he
turned
to
the
foundations
of
America
’
s
oldest
alliance
,
Mr.
Blinken
’
s
emotion
was
evident.
“
It
comes
down
to
something
pretty
basic
,
”
he
said
.
“
You
know
,
we
throw
out
a
lot
of
words
and
we
just
kind
of
say
them
by
rote
.
But
at
our
best
,
our
countries
have
worked
to
actually
give
meaning
to
liberty
,
equality
,
fraternity
.
They
’

tried
to
give

to
freedom
of

.
They
’
ve
tried
to
give
meaning
to
democracy.
”
He
continued
:
“
And
ultimately
—
obviously
there
are
differences
of
culture
,
of
history
,
of
so
many
things
—
but
when
it
comes
to
a
basic
set
of
shared
values
,
there
are
few
countries
that
are
closer.
”
This
amounted
to
a
deeply
felt
personal
call
for
France
and
the
United
States
to
renew
their
bond
by
standing
together
at
a
time
of
challenges
,
from
the
coronavirus
pandemic
to
the
rise
of
China
,
that
present
“
an
imperative
for
cooperation
,
for
coordination
,
for
working
together
,
”
in
Mr.
Blinken
’
s
words.Nevertheless
,
the
convergence
of
American
and
French
views
was
a
little
surprising
in
that
Mr.
Macron
has
made
several
remarks
recently
insisting
on
the
importance
of
Europe
’
s
strategic
autonomy.Former
President
Donald
J.
Trump
disparaged
traditional
alliances
,
started
trade
wars
and
resisted
confronting
Russian
aggression
.
U.S.
allies
have
expressed
relief
that
President
Biden
has
turned
American
foreign
policy
back
in
more
familiar
directions
,
but
their
experience
with
Mr.
Trump
left
them
warier
than
ever
of
following
Washington
’
s
lead.Mr
.
Macron
has
appeared
more
conciliatory
than
the
United
States
toward
China
and
has
insisted
that
Europe
be
at
the
table
in
arms
control
negotiations
between
the
United
States
and
Russia.On
the
eve
of
the
Group
of
7
and
NATO
meetings
earlier
this
month
,
Mr.
Macron
said
:
“
Unless
my
map
has
a
problem
,
China
is
not
part
of
the
geography
of
the
Atlantic
”
—
a
clear
jab
at
NATO
confronting
China.Such
Gaullist
assertions
of
independent
French
strategy
tend
to
play
well
here
,
and
Mr.
Macron
plans
to
run
for
re-election
next
year
.
In
the
end
,
France
joined
the
other
large
,
wealthy
democracies
at
the
G7
in
making
clear
that
they
saw
China
and
Russia
as
repressive
and
aggressive
ideological
rivals
,
and
other
NATO
members
in
saying
China
presents
“
systemic
challenges
”
to
“
areas
relevant
to
military
security.
”
China
’
s
Belt
and
Road
Initiative
has
built
roads
,
ports
,
railways
and
communications
networks
across
Africa
and
elsewhere
,
expanding
Beijing
’
s
economic
and
security
influence
with
the
countries
that
sign
on
,
leaving
them
beholden
and
often
deeply
indebted.Turning
to
the
Biden
administration
’
s
attempt
to
counter
China
’
s
strategy
through
a
“
Build
Back
Better
for
the
World
”
program
,
dubbed
B3W
,
Mr.
Blinken
made
clear
in
the
interview
which
he
thinks
the
better
option
is
for
low
and
middle-income
countries.
“
We
’
re
offering
something
positive
and
affirmative
,
”
he
said
.
“
It
so
happens
that
what
China
is
offering
is
not
so
positive
and
not
so
affirmative
.
Well
,
I
think
the
contrast
is
clear.
”
With
China
,
he
said
,
“
there
are
always
strings
attached
,
”
including
“
the
use
of
vaccines
as
a
coercive
tool
with
other
countries.
”
The
West
,
by
contrast
,
was
pledging
one
billion
vaccine
doses
to
end
the
pandemic
“
with
no
political
strings.
”
After
six
rounds
of
nuclear
talks
with
Tehran
and
no
agreement
to
revive
the
2015
Iran
nuclear
deal
,
which
Mr.
Trump
abandoned
,
Mr.
Blinken
said
that
the
progress
of
Iran
’
s
nuclear
program
could
become
an
insurmountable
obstacle.
“
If
this
continues
,
if
they
continue
to
spin
more
sophisticated
centrifuges
at
higher
and
higher
levels
,
we
will
get
to
a
point
where
it
will
be
very
difficult
as
a
practical
matter
”
to
return
to
the
parameters
of
the
original
nuclear
deal
,
he
said.
“
I
can
’
t
put
a
date
on
it
,
”
Mr.
Blinken
said
of
the
day
when
the
Biden
administration
might
walk
away
from
the
nuclear
talks
,
but
“
it
’
s
getting
closer.
”
During
a
news
conference
earlier
in
the
day
with
Mr
.
Le
Drian
,
Mr.
Blinken
warned
that
“
serious
differences
”
persist
with
Tehran
over
its
nuclear
program
but
that
preventing
an
Iranian
nuclear
weapons
capability
remains
in
the
American
national
interest.Of
his
planned
meeting
next
week
in
Italy
with
the
new
Israeli
foreign
minister
,
Yair
Lapid
,
Mr.
Blinken
said
one
aim
was
to
“
try
to
rebuild
a
little
bit
more
trust
and
confidence
between
Israelis
and
Palestinians
so
that
at
some
point
the
conditions
may
exist
to
actually
to
move
forward
again
on
negotiations
,
on
a
lasting
peace.
”
The
Biden
administration
strongly
supported
the
Abraham
Accords
,
concluded
under
the
Trump
Administration
,
normalizing
Israel
’
s
relations
with
four
Arab
states
,
Mr.
Blinken
said.Referring
to
Israel
’
s
recent
war
with
Hamas
in
Gaza
,
as
well
as
clashes
in
Israel
and
the
occupied
West
Bank
,
he
added
,
“
But
we
also
know
—
and
I
think
we
’
ve
just
seen
evidence
of
that
—
that
they
are
not
a
substitute
for
dealing
with
the
Israeli-Palestinian
issue.
”
The
rigors
of
protecting
a
president
,
a
vice
president
and
their
families
in
an
election
year
amid
a
pandemic
placed
a
heavy
burden
on
the
Secret
Service
,
with
nearly
900
employees
testing
positive
for
the
coronavirus
,
a
watchdog
group
said
this
week.The
group
,
the
Citizens
for
Responsibility
and
Ethics
in
Washington
,
faulted
former
President
Donald
J.
Trump
for
continuing
to
hold
large
campaign
rallies
,
which
it
said
had
contributed
to
the
infections.It
obtained
the
Secret
Service
data
from
the
federal
government
as
part
of
a
public
records
request
under
the
Freedom
of
Information
Act
.
The
cases
were
recorded
from
March
2020
to
March
of
this
year
,
according
to
the
group
,
but
the
data
did
not
include
details
of
the
assignments
of
the
agents
who
were
infected
.
The
government
also
did
not
disclose
what
percentage
of
the
total
number
of
Secret
Service
employees
had
contracted
the
virus
.
The
employees
who
tested
positive
included
477
special
agents
,
249
members
of
the
uniformed
division
and
131
staff
members
working
in
administrative
,
professional
and
technical
positions
,
according
to
the
group
.
The
Secret
Service
is
the
main
federal
law
enforcement
agency
charged
with
protecting
U.S.
political
leaders
,
including
the
president
,
and
the
families.
“
Throughout
the
pandemic
,
then-President
and
Vice
President
Trump
and
Pence
held
large-scale
rallies
against
public
health
guidelines
,
and
Trump
and
his
family
made
repeated
protected
trips
to
Trump-branded
properties
which
the
then-president
was
making
millions
of
dollars
a
year
from
,
”
the
group
said
on
Tuesday
in
a
post
on
its
website
.
The
group
also
blamed
the
former
president
for
riding
in
a
vehicle
with
Secret
Service
protection
while
he
was
under
treatment
for
a
coronavirus
infection
last
October
,
“
further
putting
agents
in
danger
,
”
it
said.Representatives
for
Mr.
Trump
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
on
Wednesday
night
.
A
spokeswoman
for
the
Secret
Service
said
in
an
emailed
statement
on
Wednesday
that
the
agency
had
distributed
masks
,
gloves
and
other
protective
gear
to
employees
and
conducted
a
robust
virus-testing
program
.
She
added
that
the
agency
’
s
mission
“
required
significant
public
interaction
during
a
public
health
crisis
”
and
that
it
“
was
fully
prepared
and
staffed
to
successfully
meet
these
challenges.
”
Last
November
,
the
Secret
Service
’
s
uniformed-officer
division
experienced
a
coronavirus
outbreak
,
according
to
several
people
who
were
briefed
on
the
matter
at
the
time
.
The
outbreak
was
at
least
the
fourth
to
strike
the
agency
since
the
pandemic
began
,
with
at
least
30
uniformed
Secret
Service
officers
testing
positive
for
the
virus
over
several
weeks
.
About
60
officers
had
been
asked
by
the
agency
to
go
into
quarantine.In
the
final
months
of
Mr.
Trump
’
s
presidency
,
the
virus
permeated
the
West
Wing
.
Several
of
his
top
aides
tested
positive
,
including
Hope
Hicks
,
his
adviser
;
Kayleigh
McEnany
,
the
White
House
press
secretary
;
and
two
of
Ms.
McEnany
’
s
deputies
,
Chad
Gilmartin
and
Karoline
Leavitt.Mr
.
Trump
,
who
had
eschewed
wearing
masks
for
months
,
was
sicker
with
Covid-19
last
October
than
the
White
House
publicly
acknowledged
at
the
time
,
according
to
several
people
familiar
with
his
condition
.
At
the
time
that
he
was
hospitalized
,
his
blood
oxygen
levels
had
plunged
and
officials
feared
he
was
on
the
verge
of
being
placed
on
a
ventilator.WASHINGTON
—
President
Biden
implored
Americans
on
Thursday
to
“
knock
on
doors
and
talk
to
friends
and
neighbors
”
about
getting
vaccinated
,
as
the
White
House
opened
a
campaign-like
blitz
to
persuade
people
around
the
country
to
get
their
shots.Mr
.
Biden
’
s
speech
,
in
North
Carolina
,
came
as
the
government
is
shifting
its
strategy
from
mass
vaccination
sites
to
a
more
localized
effort
—
deploying
top
officials
to
local
communities
,
with
an
eye
toward
younger
Americans
who
have
not
had
the
access
or
are
reluctant
to
get
vaccinated.
“
This
can
be
among
the
most
important
things
you
do
,
”
Mr.
Biden
said
,
before
reminding
the
crowd
of
dozens
of
canvassers
and
attendees
at
Green
Road
Community
Center
in
Raleigh
that
more
than
600,000
Americans
have
died
from
Covid-19.The
White
House
has
sent
other
big
names
out
on
the
road
recently
,
as
well
.
The
first
lady
,
Jill
Biden
,
visited
vaccination
sites
in
Florida
on
Thursday
and
planned
to
travel
to
at
least
five
states
between
this
week
and
July
4
.
(
It
is
a
traveling
schedule
that
,
at
this
point
,
is
busier
than
her
husband
’
s.
)
Dr
.
Anthony
S.
Fauci
knocked
on
doors
last
weekend
in
a
predominantly
African
American
neighborhood
in
Washington
,
and
Douglas
Emhoff
,
Vice
President
Kamala
Harris
’
s
husband
,
visited
a
barbershop
in
Chicago
this
week
to
learn
why
residents
were
turning
away
shots.The
message
has
been
clear
:
Vaccines
are
available
and
beneficial
,
with
mobile
vaccination
units
in
many
neighborhoods
and
extended
hours
at
pharmacies
.
On
Thursday
,
Mr.
Biden
also
encouraged
those
in
Raleigh
to
take
advantage
of
free
trips
by
ride-hailing
companies
to
vaccination
sites.The
flurry
of
travel
reflects
the
sense
of
urgency
as
the
pace
of
vaccinations
slows
and
the
White
House
acknowledges
that
the
country
will
most
likely
fall
short
of
Mr.
Biden
’
s
goal
of
partially
inoculating
70
percent
of
American
adults
by
July
4.Health
officials
also
warn
of
the
rising
danger
of
the
Delta
variant
,
a
more
contagious
version
of
the
coronavirus
first
identified
in
India
.
Dr.
Fauci
said
this
week
that
the
variant
accounted
for
an
estimated
20
percent
of
new
infections.
“
You
know
there
’
s
going
to
be
others
,
as
well
,
”
Mr.
Biden
said
of
the
variant
.
“
You
know
it
’
s
going
to
happen
.
We
got
to
get
our
young
people
vaccinated
.
So
talk
to
those
moms
when
you
knock
on
the
doors.
”
North
Carolina
exemplifies
many
of
the
challenges
the
Biden
administration
is
facing
.
Just
45
percent
of
the
state
is
partially
vaccinated
,
and
7
percent
of
those
between
ages
18
and
24
have
received
at
least
one
shot
,
according
to
the
state
’
s
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services.The
White
House
is
hoping
78-year-old
Mr.
Biden
can
help
convince
them.
“
With
age
comes
wisdom
,
and
we
’
ve
certainly
seen
that
here
with
their
rollout
of
the
vaccine
in
the
United
States
,
”
said
Dr.
David
Wohl
,
the
medical
director
of
vaccination
clinics
at
the
University
of
North
Carolina
,
Chapel
Hill.To
speed
vaccinations
,
he
said
,
Mr.
Biden
would
need
to
treat
the
outreach
“
like
a
political
campaign.
”
“
We
have
a
tall
order
in
front
of
us
,
”
Dr.
Wohl
said
.
“
I
think
he
’
s
walking
the
walk
.
I
think
he
’
s
saying
you
’
re
not
impervious
to
this
virus
.
You
can
get
sick.
”
Dr
.
Carlos
del
Rio
,
a
professor
of
medicine
and
an
infectious
disease
expert
at
Emory
University
in
Atlanta
,
said
the
administration
should
stick
to
relying
on
localities
rather
than
top
government
officials.
“
I
don
’
t
think
he
’
s
a
good
messenger
,
”
Dr.
del
Rio
said
.
“
I
don
’
t
want
the
government
to
tell
me
to
get
a
vaccine
.
I
want
my
doctor
.
I
want
the
fireman
who
goes
to
church
with
me
.
You
need
trusted
messengers.
”
Dr
.
del
Rio
said
he
had
been
working
with
the
African
American
community
in
Atlanta
,
where
preachers
have
been
instrumental
in
persuading
their
congregants
to
get
vaccinated.Experts
know
that
one
way
to
address
vaccine
hesitancy
is
for
individual
doctors
to
recommend
vaccination
,
or
offer
the
vaccine
to
patients
who
may
come
in
for
other
reasons.Mr
.
Biden
also
used
his
speech
to
acknowledge
the
distrust
in
the
Black
community
about
the
vaccine.When
coronavirus
vaccines
were
introduced
in
the
past
year
,
researchers
tracked
a
rise
in
social
media
posts
about
the
infamous
Tuskegee
study
in
which
health
officials
followed
African
American
men
infected
with
syphilis
but
did
not
treat
them.Mr
.
Biden
noted
that
people
of
color
received
more
than
half
of
the
roughly
six
million
shots
administered
at
federally
run
mass
vaccination
sites.
“
The
more
we
close
the
racial
gap
in
vaccinations
,
the
more
lives
we
can
save
,
”
he
said.The
push
for
vaccinations
has
also
run
into
reluctance
among
many
conservatives
,
who
cite
a
variety
of
worries
including
religious
concerns
and
distrust
of
the
government.On
Thursday
,
Mr.
Biden
’
s
focus
was
on
young
people.Just
over
one-third
of
adults
ages
18
to
39
reported
being
vaccinated
,
according
to
a
report
released
on
Monday
by
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
.
Those
who
were
24
or
younger
,
as
well
as
non-Hispanic
Black
people
and
those
with
lower
incomes
,
less
education
and
no
health
insurance
,
had
the
lowest
reported
vaccination
rates
and
expressed
the
least
interest
in
getting
vaccinated
,
the
report
said.Mr
.
Biden
made
clear
on
Thursday
that
he
would
need
the
help
of
those
listening
to
him
in
the
community
center.
“
I
have
faith
in
your
generation
,
”
he
said.He
is
also
relying
on
his
closest
advisers
,
including
the
first
lady
,
who
visited
a
drive-through
vaccination
site
in
Kissimmee
,
Fla.
,
on
Thursday.A
line
of
cars
crawled
through
the
parking
lot
to
the
mobile
clinic
,
where
Dr.
Biden
and
Dr.
Fauci
greeted
health
care
workers
and
those
who
were
waiting
for
shots.
“
See
how
easy
that
was
?
”
Dr.
Biden
said
after
a
driver
received
a
jab
and
a
vaccine
card.Teenagers
keep
all
sorts
of
secrets
from
their
parents
.
Drinking
.
Sex
.
Lousy
grades.But
the
secret
that
Elizabeth
,
17
,
a
rising
high-school
senior
,
keeps
from
hers
is
new
to
the
buffet
of
adolescent
misdeeds
.
She
doesn
’
t
want
her
parents
to
know
that
she
is
vaccinated
against
Covid-19.Her
divorced
parents
have
equal
say
over
her
health
care
.
Although
her
mother
strongly
favors
the
vaccine
,
her
father
angrily
opposes
it
and
has
threatened
to
sue
her
mother
if
Elizabeth
gets
the
shot
.
Elizabeth
is
keeping
her
secret
not
only
from
her
father
,
but
also
her
mother
,
so
her
mom
can
have
plausible
deniability
.
The
vaccination
of
children
is
crucial
to
achieving
broad
immunity
to
the
coronavirus
and
returning
to
normal
school
and
work
routines
.
But
though
Covid
vaccines
have
been
authorized
for
children
as
young
as
12
,
many
parents
,
worried
about
side
effects
and
frightened
by
the
newness
of
the
shots
,
have
held
off
from
permitting
their
children
to
get
them.A
recent
poll
by
the
Kaiser
Family
Foundation
found
that
only
three
in
10
parents
of
children
between
the
ages
of
12
through
17
intended
to
allow
them
to
be
vaccinated
immediately
.
Many
say
they
will
wait
for
long-term
safety
data
or
the
prod
of
a
school
mandate
.
But
with
many
teenagers
eager
to
get
shots
that
they
see
as
unlocking
freedoms
denied
during
the
pandemic
,
tensions
are
crackling
in
homes
in
which
parents
are
holding
to
a
hard
no.Forty
states
require
parental
consent
for
vaccination
of
minors
under
18
,
and
Nebraska
sets
the
age
at
19
.
(
Some
states
carve
out
exemptions
for
teenagers
who
are
homeless
or
emancipated
.
)
Now
,
because
of
the
Covid
crisis
,
some
states
and
cities
are
seeking
to
relax
medical
consent
rules
,
emulating
statutes
that
permit
minors
to
obtain
the
HPV
vaccine
,
which
prevents
some
cancers
caused
by
a
sexually
transmitted
virus.Last
fall
,
the
District
of
Columbia
Council
voted
to
allow
children
as
young
as
11
to
get
recommended
vaccines
without
parental
consent
.
The
New
Jersey
and
New
York
legislatures
have
bills
pending
that
would
allow
children
as
young
as
14
to
consent
to
vaccines
;
Minnesota
has
one
that
would
permit
some
children
as
young
as
12
to
consent
to
Covid
shots.But
other
states
are
marching
in
the
opposite
direction
.
Although
South
Carolina
teenagers
can
consent
at
16
,
and
doctors
may
perform
certain
medically
necessary
procedures
without
parental
permission
on
even
younger
children
,
a
bill
in
the
Legislature
would
explicitly
bar
providers
from
giving
the
Covid
shot
without
parental
consent
to
minors
.
In
Oregon
,
where
the
age
of
medical
consent
is
15
,
Linn
County
ordered
county-run
clinics
to
obtain
parental
consent
for
the
Covid
shot
for
anyone
under
18
.
According
to
the
National
Conference
of
State
Legislatures
,
which
has
been
tracking
Covid-related
bills
,
some
states
,
including
Tennessee
and
Alabama
,
are
working
on
legislation
to
prevent
public
schools
from
requiring
Covid
shots.The
issue
of
who
can
consent
to
the
Covid
shots
is
providing
fresh
context
for
decades-old
legal
,
ethical
and
medical
questions
.
When
parents
disagree
,
who
is
the
arbiter
?
At
what
age
are
children
capable
of
making
their
own
health
decisions
and
how
should
that
be
determined
?
“
Isabella
wants
it
because
her
friends
are
getting
it
,
and
she
doesn
’
t
want
to
wear
a
mask
,
”
said
Charisse
,
a
mother
of
a
17-year-old
in
Delray
Beach
,
Fla.
,
who
asked
that
her
last
name
be
withheld
for
family
privacy
.
Charisse
fears
the
shot
could
have
an
effect
on
her
daughter
’
s
reproductive
system
(
a
misperception
that
public
health
officials
have
repeatedly
refuted
)
.
“
Isabella
said
,
‘
It
’
s
my
body.
’
And
I
said
,
‘
Well
,
it
’
s
my
body
until
you
’
re
18.
’
”
As
both
the
legal
debates
and
family
arguments
unfold
,
those
administering
the
vaccine
at
pharmacies
,
clinics
and
medical
offices
are
trying
to
determine
how
to
proceed
when
a
young
teen
shows
up
for
the
Covid
shot
without
a
parent.
“
We
may
be
in
a
legal
gray
zone
with
this
vaccine
,
”
said
Dr.
Sterling
Ransone
Jr.
,
a
family
physician
in
Deltaville
,
Va
.
In
his
health
system
,
a
parent
can
send
a
signed
consent
form
for
a
teenager
to
be
vaccinated
.
But
because
the
Covid
vaccine
is
authorized
only
for
emergency
use
,
the
health
system
requires
a
parent
to
be
present
for
a
patient
under
18
to
get
that
shot.Marina
,
15
,
who
lives
in
Palm
Beach
County
,
Fla.
,
—
and
who
,
like
others
interviewed
,
asked
not
to
be
fully
identified
—
longs
for
the
shot
.
But
her
mother
says
absolutely
not
.
The
subject
is
not
open
for
discussion.And
so
Marina
has
been
excluded
from
the
social
life
she
covets
.
“
Five
of
my
friends
are
throwing
a
party
and
they
invited
me
,
but
then
they
said
,
‘
Are
you
vaccinated
?
’
”
she
said
.
“
So
I
can
’
t
go
.
That
hurts.
”
As
the
pandemic
ebbs
,
some
teen
social
circles
are
reconstituting
based
on
vaccination
status
.
“
I
see
my
friends
posting
on
social
media
—
‘
Woo-Hoo
I
got
it
!
’
—
and
now
when
I
see
them
,
they
ask
me
things
like
,
‘
Where
have
you
been
?
Are
you
traveling
a
lot
?
Are
you
sure
you
don
’
t
have
Covid
?
’
It
sucks
that
I
can
’
t
get
the
shot
,
”
Marina
continued.Increasingly
,
frustrated
teenagers
are
searching
for
ways
to
be
vaccinated
without
their
parents
’
consent
.
Some
have
found
their
way
to
VaxTeen.org
,
a
vaccine
information
site
run
by
Kelly
Danielpour
,
a
Los
Angeles
teenager.The
site
offers
guides
to
state
consent
laws
,
links
to
clinics
,
resources
on
straightforward
information
about
Covid-19
and
advice
for
how
teenagers
can
engage
parents.
“
Someone
will
ask
me
,
‘
I
need
to
be
able
to
consent
at
a
vaccine
clinic
that
is
open
on
weekends
and
that
is
on
my
bus
route
.
Can
you
help
?
’
”
said
Ms.
Danielpour
,
18
,
who
will
begin
her
freshman
year
at
Stanford
in
the
fall.She
started
the
site
two
years
ago
,
well
before
Covid
.
The
daughter
of
a
pediatric
neurosurgeon
and
an
intellectual
property
lawyer
,
she
realized
that
most
adolescents
know
neither
the
recommended
vaccine
schedule
nor
their
rights.
“
We
automatically
talk
about
parents
but
not
about
teens
as
having
opinions
on
this
issue
,
”
she
said
.
“
I
decided
I
needed
to
help.
”
Ms.
Danielpour
wrangled
experts
to
help
her
understand
vaccination
and
consent
laws
,
and
she
recruited
teenagers
to
be
“
VaxTeen
ambassadors.
”
“
I
want
teenagers
to
be
able
to
say
to
pediatricians
,
‘
Hey
,
I
have
this
right
,
’
”
added
Ms.
Danielpour
,
who
gives
talks
at
conferences
to
physicians
and
health
department
officials.Elizabeth
,
who
asked
to
be
identified
by
her
middle
name
,
surreptitiously
got
her
vaccine
at
a
school
pop-up
clinic.After
administrators
at
her
boarding
school
informed
parents
they
would
be
offering
Covid
shots
,
her
mother
gave
permission
.
Her
father
forbade
it
.
Upset
,
Elizabeth
consulted
the
school
nurse
,
who
said
she
could
not
be
vaccinated
without
approval
from
both
.
Elizabeth
researched
state
laws
,
learning
that
she
wasn
’
t
old
enough
to
consent
on
her
own.She
showed
up
anyway
.
At
worst
,
she
figured
,
the
school
would
just
turn
her
away.Apparently
,
they
took
note
only
of
her
mother
’
s
consent
.
Saying
nothing
,
Elizabeth
stuck
out
her
arm.Now
she
is
in
a
pickle
.
The
school
is
requiring
students
to
be
vaccinated
for
the
fall
semester
and
she
says
her
father
has
begun
warring
with
the
administration
over
the
issue
.
Elizabeth
is
afraid
that
if
he
learns
how
she
was
vaccinated
,
he
will
be
furious
and
tell
the
school
,
which
will
discipline
her
for
having
deceived
vaccinators
,
a
stain
on
her
record
just
as
she
is
applying
to
college.Gregory
D.
Zimet
,
a
psychologist
and
professor
of
pediatrics
at
Indiana
University
School
of
Medicine
,
pointed
out
the
irony
of
an
adolescent
being
legally
prevented
from
making
a
choice
that
was
strenuously
urged
by
public
health
officials
.
Developmentally
,
he
said
,
adolescents
at
14
and
even
younger
are
at
least
as
good
as
adults
at
weighing
the
risks
of
a
vaccine
.
“
Which
isn
’
t
to
say
that
adults
are
necessarily
great
at
it
,
”
he
added.In
many
states
,
young
teenagers
can
make
decisions
around
contraception
and
sexually
transmitted
infections
,
which
are
,
he
noted
,
“
in
many
ways
more
complex
and
fraught
than
getting
a
vaccine.
”
Pediatricians
say
that
even
parents
who
have
themselves
been
vaccinated
are
wary
for
their
children
.
Dr.
Jay
Lee
,
a
family
physician
and
chief
medical
officer
of
Share
Our
Selves
,
a
community
health
network
in
Orange
County
,
Calif.
,
said
parents
say
they
would
rather
risk
their
child
having
Covid
than
get
the
new
vaccine.
“
I
will
validate
their
concerns
,
”
Dr.
Lee
said
,
“
but
I
point
out
that
waiting
to
see
if
your
child
gets
sick
is
not
a
good
strategy
.
And
that
no
,
Covid
is
not
just
like
the
flu.
”
Elise
Yarnell
,
a
senior
clinic
operations
manager
for
the
Portland
,
Ore.
,
area
at
Providence
,
a
large
health
care
system
,
recalled
a
16-year-old
girl
who
showed
up
at
a
Covid
vaccine
clinic
at
her
school
in
Yamhill
County.Her
parents
oppose
the
vaccine
so
she
wanted
to
get
it
without
them
knowing
,
which
she
could
do
legally
because
Oregon
’
s
age
of
consent
is
15
.
She
teared
up
when
she
saw
the
shots
were
not
ready
before
she
had
to
be
home
,
but
she
was
able
to
return
that
night
without
alerting
her
parents
and
was
vaccinated.
“
She
was
extremely
relieved
,
”
Ms.
Yarnell
said.Isabella
is
the
17-year-old
daughter
of
Charisse
,
the
Delray
Beach
,
Fla.
,
mother
who
refuses
to
grant
permission
for
the
vaccine
.
Asked
why
she
wanted
the
shot
,
Isabella
gave
a
stream
of
reasons
.
“
A
lot
of
older
people
in
my
family
are
at
risk
for
catching
Covid
and
possibly
dying
,
”
she
said
.
“
I
want
to
get
the
vaccine
so
I
can
be
around
them
,
and
they
’
ll
be
safe
.
And
then
I
can
go
out
with
my
friends
again
,
and
they
won
’
t
be
so
much
at
risk
either.
”
Although
doctors
have
been
trying
to
instill
vaccine
confidence
in
parents
as
well
as
patients
,
there
’
s
not
much
they
can
do
when
parents
object
.
Recently
,
Dr.
Mobeen
H.
Rathore
,
a
pediatrics
professor
at
the
University
of
Florida
medical
college
in
Jacksonville
,
told
a
patient
whose
mother
refused
consent
that
she
couldn
’
t
get
the
Covid
vaccine
until
she
turned
18
,
three
weeks
hence.
“
She
got
vaccinated
on
her
birthday
,
”
Dr.
Rathore
said
.
“
She
sent
me
a
message
saying
that
was
her
birthday
gift
to
herself.

As
New
York
City
fully
reopens
,
tourism
officials
are
hoping
to
revive
a
critical
driver
of
its
economy
by
making
an
urgent
plea
for
visitors
to
start
rushing
back.Armed
with
$
30
million
in
federal
aid
,
the
city
’
s
tourism
promotion
agency
,
NYC
&
Company
,
is
developing
an
aggressive
campaign
to
overcome
New
York
’
s
image
as
the
original
epicenter
of
the
coronavirus
pandemic
in
the
United
States
.
They
hope
to
lure
10
million
visitors
to
the
city
for
overnight
stays
or
day
trips
between
Memorial
Day
and
Labor
Day.With
most
international
travel
still
closed
off
,
the
vast
majority
of
those
visitors
will
be
domestic
vacationers
,
not
the
higher
spending
foreign
tourists
.
But
after
the
pandemic
virtually
wiped
out
the
city
’
s
booming
tourism
industry
and
forced
many
of
its
big
hotels
to
shut
their
doors
,
any
and
all
visitors
are
welcome.
“
What
we
realized
is
that
we
need
to
create
an
urgency
to
visit
now
,
”
said
Fred
Dixon
,
the
chief
executive
of
NYC
&
Company
.
He
said
that
the
agency
’
s
surveys
of
residents
of
the
Northeast
showed
that
people
“
were
very
keen
and
eager
to
return
to
the
city
,
but
they
were
looking
for
the
sign
that
it
is
the
right
time.
”
That
sign
will
come
in
the
form
of
the
city
’
s
biggest
advertising
campaign
in
decades
,
including
national
TV
ads
with
the
theme
“
It
’
s
time
for
New
York
City.
”
Still
in
production
but
scheduled
to
start
appearing
in
two
weeks
,
those
ads
will
be
aimed
at
persuading
Americans
who
might
otherwise
have
gone
to
Europe
or
elsewhere
overseas
to
consider
spending
some
time
—
and
money
—
in
New
York
instead.The
first
video
ad
cuts
quickly
through
scenes
of
unmasked
New
Yorkers
at
play
,
from
the
New
York
Botanical
Garden
in
the
Bronx
to
the
beach
in
the
Rockaways
and
asks
,
“
Where
were
you
summer
’
21
?
”
“
The
summer
of
N.Y.C
.
is
here
and
now
it
’
s
time
to
tell
the
whole
world
about
how
this
city
is
building
a
recovery
for
all
of
us
,
”
said
Mayor
Bill
de
Blasio
.
“
Tourism
impacts
hundreds
of
thousands
of
jobs
across
the
five
boroughs
,
and
its
return
will
fuel
our
recovery
even
more.
”
The
agency
’
s
efforts
to
attract
tourists
had
been
increasingly
successful
through
2019
,
when
the
city
recorded
an
all-time
high
of
66
million
visitors
.
At
its
peak
,
the
tourism
industry
employed
more
than
280,000
workers
—
about
one
of
every
14
jobs
in
the
city
—
according
to
the
state
comptroller
’
s
office.NYC
&
Company
counts
anyone
who
travels
from
more
than
50
miles
away
as
a
visitor
,
but
it
places
a
higher
value
on
overnight
guests
.
Most
valued
of
all
are
visitors
from
overseas
because
they
tend
to
stay
longer
and
to
spend
more
money
in
hotels
,
restaurants
,
stores
and
attractions.But
almost
all
of
the
city
’
s
biggest
foreign
sources
of
visitors
,
including
China
and
Brazil
,
are
still
prohibiting
trips
to
the
United
States
.
This
year
,
Mexico
has
been
the
leading
source
of
international
tourists
,
Mr.
Dixon
said
.
He
said
he
hopes
that
Canada
and
the
United
Kingdom
start
allowing
their
citizens
to
resume
traveling
freely
to
the
United
States
soon
,
and
that
once
that
happens
,
the
agency
will
start
broadcasting
its
ads
there.The
delayed
restart
of
most
international
travel
caused
NYC
&
Company
to
revise
its
projection
for
visitors
this
year
down
slightly
,
to
36.1
million
,
from
a
previous
estimate
of
36.4
million
,
Mr.
Dixon
said.But
he
said
the
agency
predicts
visitors
will
rise
to
58.9
million
in
2022
and
surpass
65
million
again
in
2023
,
due
in
part
to
pent-up
demand
.
The
elimination
of
many
pandemic
rules
,
the
plunge
in
infection
rates
and
the
high
rate
of
vaccinations
are
all
expected
to
lead
to
more
tourists.As
part
of
its
campaign
,
NYC
&
Company
is
also
teaming
up
with
AAA
to
pitch
the
city
as
a
road-trip
destination
and
preparing
a
sweepstakes
to
give
away
trips
to
the
city
,
Mr.
Dixon
said.The
effort
was
made
possible
by
an
allocation
of
pandemic
aid
the
city
received
from
the
American
Rescue
Plan
Act
that
Congress
passed
this
spring
.
That
money
supplemented
the
agency
’
s
budget
,
which
is
funded
by
the
city
and
dues
paid
by
hotels
and
other
businesses
that
are
members.Still
the
outlook
for
the
city
’
s
hotel
industry
,
which
depends
on
extended
visits
and
business
travelers
,
is
not
as
rosy
,
according
to
Alison
Hoyt
,
senior
director
of
consulting

’
s
forecast
does
not
project
New
York
’
s
hotel
industry
to
fully
recover
to
prepandemic
levels
even
by
the
end
of
2025.The
hotel
business
in
New
York
is
rebounding
slower
than
in
many
other
places
,
especially
Sunbelt
cities
like
Miami
and
Tampa
,
Fla.
,
where
hotel
occupancy
rates
have
surpassed
prepandemic
levels
,
she
said.While
many
hotels
in
New
York
have
reopened
in
the
last
few
months
and
they
are
filling
more
of
their
rooms
each
week
,
as
a
group
they
are
still
losing
money
,
she
said
.
That
is
because
the
average
room
rate
they
are
charging
,
about
$
185
a
night
in
mid-June
,
is
below
their
average
operating
cost.In
the
week
that
ended
June
12
,
the
occupancy
rate
of
the
700,000
available
hotel
rooms
in
New
York
was
about
62
percent
,
down
from
88
percent
in
the
comparable
week
of
2019
,
Ms.
Hoyt
said
.
There
were
82
hotels
with
about
25,000
rooms
that
had
yet
to
reopen
,
she
said.Some
prominent
hotels
,
like
the
1,900-room
Hilton
near
Rockefeller
Center
,
have
remained
closed
for
more
than
a
year.Still
,
some
hotel
industry
executives
expressed
optimism
about
the
recovery
of
tourism
in
the
city
and
how
their
business
will
fare.
“
We
have
had
a
much
slower
build
back
than
some
of
the
other
markets
down
in
the
South
,
”
said
Dan
Nadeau
,
the
area
general
manager
for
Marriott
in
New
York
.
But
,
he
added
,
“
The
progression
that
we
’
ve
seen
has
been
real
and
sustained
.
We
feel
very
good
about
how
New
York
is
coming
along.
”
All
but
one
of
the
36
Marriotts
in
Midtown
Manhattan
are
open
and
they
have
been
booking
rooms
at
about
70
percent
of
their
prepandemic
pace
,
Mr.
Nadeau
said
.
He
said
that
represented
a
sharp
increase
since
the
end
of
March
and
that
he
expected
demand
to
remain
high
through
the
summer.The
scheduled
reopening
of
most
Broadway
theaters
in
September
,
he
said
,
should
provide
an
additional
boost
.
“
Everything
tells
me
that
the
reopening
of
Broadway
is
going
to
be
a
shot
in
the
arm
to
New
York
that
’
s
really
going
to
help
,
”
he
said.The
sooner
tourists
return
,
the
sooner
thousands
of
hotel
employees
will
get
their
jobs
back
.
Hotels
have
been
gradually
recalling
workers
who
have
been
furloughed
for
more
than
a
year.
“
There
’
s
no
question
that
the
market
is
recovering
,
but
it
’
s
recovering
slowly
,
”
said
Richard
Maroko
,
president
of
the
Hotel
Trades
Council
,
a
union
that
represents
about
30,000
hotel
workers
in
the
city.Mr
.
Maroko
said
the
pandemic
had
been
“
devastating
”
to
the
industry
and
his
union
’
s
members
,
but
now
they
have
reason
to
hope
.
“
They
are
waiting
for
the
tourists
to
come
back
so
that
they
can
return
to
work
,

,
emerging

the
most

crisis
since

era
of

influenza
pandemic
of
1918
.
After
the
first
cases
of
this
predominantly
respiratory
viral
illness
were
first
reported
in
Wuhan
,
Hubei
Province
,
China
,
in
late
December
2019
,
SARS-CoV-2
rapidly
disseminated
across
the
world
in
a
short
span
of
time
,
compelling
the
World
Health
Organization
(
WHO
)
to
declare
it
as
a
global
pandemic
on
March
11
,
2020
.
Since
being
declared
a
global
pandemic
,
COVID-19
has
ravaged
many
countries
worldwide
,
overwhelming
many
healthcare
systems
.
The
pandemic
has
also
resulted
in
the
loss
of
livelihoods
due
to
prolonged
shutdowns
,
which
have
had
a
rippling
effect
on
the
global
economy
.
Even
though
substantial
progress
in
clinical
research
has
led
to
a
better
understanding
of
SARS-CoV-2
and
the
management
of
COVID-19
,
limiting
the
continuing
spread
of
this
virus
has
become
an
issue
of
increasing
concern
,
as
SARS-CoV-2
continues
to
wreak
havoc
across
the
world
,
with
many
countries
enduring
a
second
or
third
wave
of
outbreaks
of
this
viral
illness
attributed
mainly
due
to
the
emergence
of
mutant
variants
of
the
virus
.
Like
other
RNA
viruses
,
SARS-CoV-2
,
while
adapting
to
their
new
human
hosts
,
is
prone
to
genetic
evolution
with
the
development
of
mutations
over
time
,
resulting
in
variants
that
may
have
different
characteristics
than
its
ancestral
strains
.
Several
variants
of
SARS-CoV-2
have
been
described
during
the
course
of
this
pandemic
,
among
which
only
a
few
are
considered
variants
of
concern
(
VOCs
)
,
given
their
impact
on
public
health
.
The
B.1.1.7
lineage
(
or
VOC
202012
)
variant
was
the
first
VOC
described
in
the
United
Kingdom
(
UK
)
in
late
December
2020
,
and
subsequently
,
the
B.1.351
lineage
(
or
501Y.V2
)
was
reported
in
South
Africa
.
A
third
VOC
,
B.1.1.248/B1.1.28/P1
(
or
501Y.V3
)
,
was
reported
in
Brazil
in
early
January
2021
,
and
more
recently
,
the
B.1.427/B.1.429
lineage
was
identified
in
California
.
Despite
the
unprecedented
speed
of
vaccine
development
against
the
prevention
of
COVID-19
and
robust
global
mass
vaccination
efforts
,
the
emergence
of
these
new
SARS-CoV-2
variants
threatens
to
overturn
the
significant
progress
made
so
far
in
limiting
the
transmission
of
this
virus.This
review
article
aims
to
comprehensively
describe
the
etiology
,
epidemiology
,
pathophysiology
,
clinical
features
,
diagnostic
methods
,
and
the
latest
novel
therapeutics
in
the
management
of
COVID-19
.
This
review
also
briefly
provides
an
overview
of
the
different
variants
of
SARS-CoV-2
and
the
efficacy
of
different
available
vaccines
for
prevention
against
COVID-19
and
its
variants
.
Coronaviruses
(
CoVs
)
are
positive-stranded
RNA
(
+ssRNA
)
viruses
with
a
crown-like
appearance
under
an
electron
microscope
(
coronam
is
the
Latin
term
for
crown
)
due
to
the
presence
of
spike
glycoproteins
on
the
envelope
.
The
subfamily
Orthocoronavirinae
of
the
Coronaviridae
family
(
order
Nidovirales
)
classifies
into
four
genera
of
CoVs
:
BetaCoV
genus
is
further
divided
into
five
sub-genera
or
lineages
.
[
1
]
Genomic
characterization
has
shown
that
bats
and
rodents
are
the
probable
gene
sources
of
alphaCoVs
and
betaCoVs
.
On
the
contrary
,
avian
species
seem
to
represent
the
gene
sources
of
deltaCoVs
and
gammaCoVs
.
CoVs
have
become
the
major
pathogens
of
emerging
respiratory
disease
outbreaks
.
Members
of
this
large
family
of
viruses
can
cause
respiratory
,
enteric
,
hepatic
,
and
neurological
diseases
in
different
animal
species
,
including
camels
,
cattle
,
cats
,
and
bats
.
For
reasons
yet
to
be
explained
,
these
viruses
can
cross
species
barriers
and
can
cause
,
in
humans
,
illness
ranging
from
the
common
cold
to
more
severe
diseases
such
as
MERS
and
SARS
.
To
date
,
seven
human
CoVs
(
HCoVs
)
capable
of
infecting
humans
have
been
identified
.
Some
of
HCoVs
were
identified
in
the
mid-1960s
,
while
others
were
only
detected
in
the
new
millennium
.
In
general
,
estimates
suggest
that
2
%
of
the
population
are
healthy
carriers
of
a
CoVs
and
that
these
viruses
are
responsible
for
about
5
%
to
10
%
of
acute
respiratory
infections
.
[

SARS-CoV-2
is
a
novel
betaCoV
belonging
to
the
same
subgenus
as
the
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
SARS-CoV
)
and
the
Middle
East
Respiratory
Syndrome
Coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
,
which
have
been
previously
implicated
in
SARS-CoV
and
MERS-CoV
epidemics
with
mortality
rates
up
to
10
%
and
35
%
,
respectively
.
[

It
has
a
round
or
elliptic
and
often
pleomorphic
form
and
a
diameter
of
approximately
60–140
nm
.
Like
other
CoVs
,
it
is
sensitive
to
ultraviolet
rays
and
heat
.
In
this
regard
,
although
high
temperature
decreases
the
replication
of
any
species
of
virus
.
Currently
,
the
inactivation
temperature
of
SARS-CoV-2
must
be
well
elucidated
.
It
appears
that
this
virus
can
be
inactivated
at
about
27°
C.
Conversely
,
it
may
resist
lower
temperatures
even
below
0°C
.
Also
,
these
viruses
can
be
effectively
inactivated
by
lipid
solvents
,
including
ether
(
75
%
)
,
ethanol
,
chlorine-containing
disinfectant
,
peroxyacetic
acid
,
and
chloroform
except
for
chlorhexidine.Genomic
characterization
of
the
new
HCoV
,
isolated
from
a
cluster-patient
with
atypical
pneumonia
after
visiting
Wuhan
,
had
89
%
nucleotide
identity
with
bat
SARS-like-CoVZXC21
and
82
%
with
that
of
human
SARS-CoV
.
Hence
,
it
was
termed
SARS-CoV-2
by
experts
of
the
International
Committee
on
Taxonomy
of
Viruses
.
The
single-stranded
RNA
genome
of
SARS-CoV-2
contains
29891
nucleotides
,
encoding
for
9860
amino
acids
.
Although
the
origin
of
SARS-CoV-2
is
currently
unknown
,
it
is
widely
postulated
to
have
originated
from
an
animal
implicating
zoonotic
transmission
.
Genomic
analyses
suggest
that
SARS-CoV-2
probably
evolved
from
a
strain
found
in
bats
.
The
genomic
comparison
between
the
human
SARS-CoV-2
sequence
and
known
animal
coronaviruses
indeed
revealed
high
homology
(
96
%
)
between
the
SARS-CoV-2
and
the
betaCoV
RaTG13
of
bats
(
Rhinolophus
affinis
)
[
4
]
Similar
to
SARS
and
MERS
,
it
has
been
hypothesized
that
SARS-CoV-2
advanced
from
bats
to
intermediate
hosts
such
as
pangolins
and
minks
,
and
then
to
humans
.
[

A
recently
released
report
by
the
WHO
describing
the
possible
origins
of
SARS-CoV-2
was
inconclusive
as
it
did
not
clearly
specify
the
origin
of
the
virus
;
however
,
it
did
report
that
the
circulation
of
SARS-CoV-2
occurred
as
early
as
December
2019
.
This
report
explored
several
possible
hypotheses
of
the
origin
of
the
virus
that
included
the
origin
of
the
virus
in
an
animal
,
the
transmission
of
the
virus
to
an
intermediate
host
,
and
subsequent
passage
into
humans.SARS-CoV-2
VariantsAs
mentioned
earlier
,
SARS-CoV-2
is
prone
to
genetic
evolution
resulting
in
multiple
variants
that
may
have
different
characteristics
compared
to
its
ancestral
strains
.
Periodic
genomic
sequencing
of
viral
samples
is
of
fundamental
importance
,
especially
in
a
global
pandemic
setting
,
as
it
helps
detect
any
new
genetic
variants
of
SARS-CoV-2
.
Notably
,
the
genetic
evolution
was
minimal
initially
with
the
emergence
of
the
globally
dominant
D614G
variant
,
which
was
associated
with
increased
transmissibility
but
without
the
ability
to
cause
severe
illness
.
[
7
]
Another
variant
was
identified
in
humans
,
attributed
to
transmission
from
infected
farmed
mink
in
Denmark
,
which
was
not
associated
with
increased
transmissibility
[
6
]
.
Since
then
,
multiple
variants
of
SARS-CoV-2
have
been
described
,
of
which
a
few
are
considered
variants
of
concern
(
VOCs
)
due
to
their
potential
to
cause
enhanced
transmissibility
or
virulence
,
reduction
in
neutralization
by
antibodies
obtained
through
natural
infection
or
vaccination
,
the
ability
to
evade
detection
,
or
a
decrease
in
therapeutics
or
vaccination
effectiveness
.
With
the
continued
emergence
of
multiple
variants
,
the
CDC
and
the
WHO
have
independently
established
a
classification
system
for
distinguishing
the
emerging
variants
of
SARS-CoV-2
into
variants
of
concern
(
VOCs
)
and
variants
of
interest
(
VOIs
)
.SARS-CoV-2
Variants
of
Concern
(
VOCs
)
SARS-CoV-2
Variants
of
Interest
(
VOI
)
VOIs
are
defined
as
variants
with
specific
genetic
markers
that
have
been
associated
with
changes
that
may
cause
enhanced
transmissibility
or
virulence
,
reduction
in
neutralization
by
antibodies
obtained
through

or

,
the
ability
to
evade

,
or
a
decrease
in
the
effectiveness
of
therapeutics
or
vaccination
.
The
WHO
Epidemiological
update
April
13
,
2021
,
described
seven
variants
of
interest
(
VOIs
)
,
namely
B.1.427/B.1.429
;
B.1.525
;
B.1.526
;
B.1.1.28.2
alias
P2
;
B.1.1.28.3
,
alias
P.3
and
B.1.616
.
The
CDC
also
has
described
three
VOIs
,
B.1.525
,
B.1.526
,
and
B.1.1.28.2.Transmission
of
SARS-CoV-2According
to
the
World
Health
Organization
(
WHO
)
,
the
emergence
of
viral
diseases
represents
a
serious
public
health
risk
.
In
the
past
two
decades
,
several
epidemics
caused
by
viruses
such
as
the
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
SARS-CoV
)
from
2002
to
2003
,
and
H1N1
influenza
in
2009
,
and
the
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
in
2012
have
been
described
which
have
had
a
significant
impact
on
global
health
.
Since
being
declared
a
global
pandemic
by
the
WHO
,
SARS-CoV-2
,
the
virus
responsible
for
COVID-19
has
spread
to
223
countries
with
more
than
138
million
cases
,
and
more
than
2.9
million
deaths
reported
globally
.
The
U.S.
experienced
the
highest
number
of
SARS-CoV-2
infections
and
COVID-19
related
deaths
.
In
fact
,
COVID-19
was
the
third
leading
cause
of
death
in
the
U.S.
in
2020
after
heart
disease
and
cancer
,
with
approximately
375,000
death
reported
.

The
general
description
of
viral
structure
and
its
genome
of
CoVs
is
essential
for
addressing
the
pathogenesis
of
SARS-CoV-2
.
As
described
earlier
,
CoVs
are
enveloped
,
positive-stranded
RNA
viruses
with
a
nucleocapsid
,
and
the
genomic
structure
is
organized
in
a
+ssRNA
of
approximately
30
kb
in
length
and
with
a
5′-cap
structure
and
3′-poly-A
tail
making
it
the
largest
among
RNA
viruses
.
Upon
entry
into
the
host
,
replication
of
the
viral
RNA
is
initiated
with
the
synthesis
of
polyprotein
1a/1ab
(
pp1a/pp1ab
)
.
The
transcription
occurs
through
the
replication-transcription
complex
(
RCT
)
organized
in
double-membrane
vesicles
and
via
the
synthesis
of
subgenomic
RNAs
(
sgRNAs
)
sequences
.
Conversely
,
transcription
termination
occurs
at
transcription
regulatory
sequences
,
located
between
the
so-called
open
reading
frames
(
ORFs
)
that
work
as
templates
for
the
production
of
subgenomic
mRNAs
.
In
an
atypical
CoV
genome
,
at
least
six
ORFs
can
be
present
.
Among
these
,
a
frameshift
between
ORF1a
and
ORF1b
guides
the
production
of
both
pp1a
and
pp1ab
polypeptides
that
are
processed
by
virally
encoded
chymotrypsin-like
protease
(
3CLpro
)
or
main
protease
(
Mpro
)
,
as
well
as
one
or
two
papain-like
proteases
for
producing
16
with
known
or
predicted
RNA
synthesis
and
modification
functions
non-structural
proteins
(
NSPs
1-16
)
.
Besides
ORF1a
and
ORF1b
,
other
ORFs
encode
structural
proteins
,
including
spike
,
membrane
,
envelope
,
and
nucleocapsid
proteins
and
accessory
proteic
chains.
[
3
]
.
Different
CoVs
possess
unique
structural
and
accessory
proteins
translated
by
dedicated
sgRNAs.The
pathogenesis
of
CoVs
and
SARS-CoV-2
is
related
to
the
function
of
the
NSPs
and
structural
proteins
.
For
example
,
researchers
have
outlined
the
role
of
NSPs
in
blocking
the
host
's
innate
immune
response
.
[
2
]
Among
functions
of
structural
proteins
,
the
envelope
has
a
crucial
role
in
virus
pathogenicity
as
it
promotes
viral
assembly
and
release
.
Among
the
structural
elements
of
CoVs
,
there
are
the
spike
glycoproteins
composed
of
two
subunits
(
S1
and
S2
)
.
Homotrimers
of
S
proteins
compose
the
spikes
on
the
viral
surface
,
guiding
the
link
to
host
receptors
.
[

]
Pathogenesis
of
SARS-CoV-2Structurally
and
phylogenetically
,
SARS-CoV-2
is
similar
to
SARS-CoV
and
MERS-CoV
and
is
composed
of
four
main
structural
proteins
:
spike
(
S
)
,
envelope
(
E
)
glycoprotein
,
nucleocapsid
(
N
)
,
membrane
(
M
)
protein
,
along
with
16
nonstructural
proteins
,
and
5-8
accessory
proteins
.
[
37
]
The
surface
spike
(
S
)
glycoprotein
,
which
resembles
a
crown
,
is
located
on
the
outer
surface
of
the
virion
and
undergoes
cleavage
into
an
amino
(
N
)
-terminal
S1
subunit
,
which
facilitates
the
incorporation
of
the
virus
into
the
host
cell
and
a
carboxyl
(
C
)
-terminal
S2
subunit
containing
a
fusion
peptide
,
a
transmembrane
domain
,
and
cytoplasmic
domain
is
responsible
for
virus-cell
membrane
fusion
.
[
38
]
[
39
]
The
S1
subunit
is
further
divided
into
a
receptor-binding
domain
(
RBD
)
and
N-terminal
domain
(
NTD
)
,
which
facilitates
viral
entry
into
the
host
cell
and
serves
as
a
potential
target
for
neutralization
in
response
to
antisera
or
vaccines
.
[
36
]
The
RBD
is
a
fundamental
peptide
domain
in
the
pathogenesis
of
infection
as
it
represents
a
binding
site
for
the
human
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
2
(
ACE2
)
receptors
.
Inhibition
of
the
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system
(
RAAS
)
,
as
previously
hypothesized
,
does
not
increase
the
risk
of
hospitalization
for
COVID-19
and
severe
disease
.
[

SARS-CoV-2
gains
entry
into
the
hosts
'
cells
by
binding
the
SARS-CoV-2
spike
or
S
protein
(
S1
)
to
the
ACE2
receptors
abundantly
on
respiratory
epithelium
such
as
type
II
alveolar
epithelial

.
Besides
the
respiratory

,
ACE2

are
also
expressed
by
other
organs
such
as
the
upper

,
enterocytes
from
the
ileum
,
myocardial
cells
,
proximal

cells
of
the
kidney
,
and
urothelial

of
the

.
[

The
viral
attachment
process
is
followed
by
priming
the
spike
protein
S2
subunit
by
the
host
transmembrane
serine
protease

)
that
facilitates

with
the
assembly

In
summary
,
the
spike
RBD
allows
the
binding
to
the
ACE2
receptor
in
the
lungs
and
other
tissues
.
The
spike
protein
of
an
amino
acid
site
(
polybasic
site
)
allows
the
functional
processing
of
the
same
by
the
human
enzyme
furin
(
protease
)
.
This
process
enables
the
exposure
of
the
fusion
sequences
and
,
therefore
,
the
fusion
of
the
viral
and
cell
membranes
,
a
necessary
passage
for
the

to
enter
the

of
SARS-CoV-2
on
the
Respiratory
System/Pathogenesis
of
SARS-CoV-2-induced
PneumoniaCOVID-19
is
primarily
considered
a
viral
respiratory
illness
as
its
causative
agent
,
SARS-CoV-2
,
predominantly
targets
the
respiratory
system
.
The
pathogenesis
of
SARS-CoV-2
induced
pneumonia
is
best
explained
by
two
stages
,
an
early
and
a
late
phase
.
The
early
phase
is
characterized
by
viral
replication
resulting
in
direct
virus-mediated
tissue
damage
,
which
is
followed
by
a
late
phase
when
the
infected
host
cells
trigger
an
immune
response
with
the
recruitment
of
T
lymphocytes
,
monocytes
,
and
neutrophil
recruitment
which
releases
cytokines
such
as
tumor
necrosis
factor-α
(
TNF
α
)
,
granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating
factor
(
GM-CSF
)
,
interleukin-1
(

)
,
interleukin-6
(
IL-6
)
,
)
,
IL-1β
,
IL-8
,
IL-12
and
interferon
(
IFN
)
-γ
.
In
severe
COVID-19
,
the
immune
system
's
overactivation
results
in
a
'cytokine
storm
'
characterized
by
the
release
of
high
levels
of
cytokines
,
especially
IL-6
and
TNF-α
,
into
the
circulation
,
causing
a
local
and
systemic

The
increased
vascular
permeability
and
subsequent
development
of
pulmonary
edema
in
patients
with
severe

are
explained
by
multiple
mechanisms
,

Besides
IL-6
and
TNF-α
,
binding
of
SARS-CoV-2
to
the
Toll-Like
Receptor
(
TLR
)
induces
the
release
of
pro-IL-1β
,
which
is
cleaved
into
the
active
mature
IL-1β
that
mediates
lung
inflammation
,
until
fibrosis

the
respiratory

,
it

SARS-CoV-2–induced
organ

,
is

explained
by
either
one
or
a
combination
of
the
proposed
mechanisms

Implications

variation
in
the
viral
genes
of
SARS-CoV-2
can
have
implications
in
its
pathogenesis
,
especially
if
it
involves
the
RBD
,
which
mediates
viral
entry
into
the
host
cells
and
is
an
essential
target
of
vaccine
sera
monoclonal

.
All
three
reported
VOCs
(
B.1.1.7
;
B.1.351
;
and
P.1
)
have
mutations
in
the
RBD
and
the
NTD
,
of
which
N501Y
mutation
located
on
the
RBD
is
common
to
all
variants
and
results
in
increased

of
the
spike
protein
to
ACE
2
receptors
enhancing
the
viral
attachment
and
its
subsequent
entry
into
the

Along
with
NBD
,
RBD
serves
as
the
dominant

and
facilitates
antibody

Clinical
Manifestations
of
COVID-19Based
on
the
severity
of
presenting
illness
that
includes
clinical
symptoms
,
laboratory
and
radiographic
abnormalities
,
hemodynamics
,
and

The
National
Institutes

)
issued
guidelines
that
classify
COVID-19
into
five
distinct
types.ARDS
is
characterized
by
a
severe
new-onset
respiratory
failure
or
worsening
of
an
already
identified
respiratory
picture
.
The
diagnosis
requires
a
set
of
clinical
and
ventilatory
criteria
such
as
chest
imaging
utilized
includes
chest
radiograph
,
CT
scan
,

there
are
clinical
and
radiologic
findings
of
pulmonary
edema
,
heart
failure
,
or
other
causes
such
as
fluid
overload
,
they
should
be
excluded

Extrapulmonary
Manifestations
Although
COVID-19
,
the
illness
caused
by
SARS-CoV-2
,
predominantly
affects
the
respiratory
system
,
COVID-19
can
be
considered
a
systemic
viral
illness
given
the
multiple
organ
dysfunction
associated
with
this
illness.A
detailed
clinical
history

the
onset
and
duration
of
symptoms
,
travel
history
,
exposure
to
people
with
COVID-19
infection
,
underlying
preexisting
medical
conditions
,
and
drug
history
should
be
elicited
by
treating
providers
.
Patients
with

such
as
fever
,
cough
,
sore
throat
,
loss
of
taste
or
smell
,
malaise
,
and
myalgias
should
be
promptly
tested
for
SARS-CoV-2
.
Besides
symptomatic
patients
,
patients
with
atypical
symptoms
of
COVID-19
or
anyone
with
known
high-risk
exposure
to
SARS-CoV-2
should

In
summary
,
during
the
course
of
the
illness
,
it
is
possible
to
identify
the
first
phase
with
focal
areas
of
fixed
B
lines
followed
by
a
phase
of
numerical
increase
of
the

with
small
subpleural
thickening
,
which
progresses
further
until
there
is
evidence
of
posterior
consolidations.Initially
,
early
in
the
pandemic
,
the
understanding
of
COVID-19
and
its
therapeutic
management
was
limited
,
creating
an
urgency
to
mitigate
this
new
viral
illness
with
experimental
therapies
and
drug
repurposing
.
Since
then
,
due
to
the
intense
efforts
of
clinical
researchers
globally
,
significant
progress
has
been
made
,
which
has
led
to
a
better
understanding
of
not
only
COVID-19
and
its
management
but
also
has
resulted
in
the
development
of
novel
therapeutics
and
vaccine
development
at
an
unprecedented
speed.Pharmacologic
Therapies
In
The
Management
Of
Adults
With
COVID-19Currently
,
a
variety
of
therapeutic
options
are
available
that
include
antiviral
drugs
(
e.g.
,
remdesivir
)
,
anti-SARS-CoV-2
monoclonal
antibodies
(
e.g.
,
bamlanivimab/etesevimab
,
casirivimab/imdevimab
)
,
anti-inflammatory
drugs
(
e.g.
,
dexamethasone
)
,
immunomodulators
agents
(
e.g.
,
baricitinib
,
tocilizumab
)
are
available
under
FDA
issued
Emergency
Use
Authorization
(
EUA
)
or
being
evaluated
in
the
management
of
COVID-19
.
[

The
clinical
utility
of
these
treatments
is
specific
and
is
based
on
the
severity
of
illness
or
certain
risk
factors
.
The
clinical
course
of
the
COVID-19
illness
occurs
in
2
phases
,
an
early
phase
when
SARS-CoV-2
replication
is
greatest
before
or
soon
after
the
onset
of
symptoms
.
Antiviral
medications
and
antibody-based
treatments
are
likely
to
be
more
effective
during
this
stage
of
viral
replication
.
The
later
phase
of
the
illness
is
driven
by
a
hyperinflammatory
state
induced
by
the
release
of
cytokines
and
the
coagulation
system
’
s
activation
that
causes
a
prothrombotic
state
.
Anti-inflammatory
drugs
such
as
corticosteroids
,
immunomodulating
therapies
,
or
a
combination
of
these
therapies
may
help
combat
this
hyperinflammatory
state
than
antiviral
therapies
.

Below
is
a
summary
of
the
latest
potential
therapeutic
options
proposed

use
in
the
management
of
COVID-19.Antiviral

and
the
duration
of
how
long
this
immunity
lasts
is
unclear
.
Nevertheless
,
their
role
as
therapeutic
agents
in
the
management
of

is
extensively
being
pursued
in
ongoing
clinical
trials.Immunomodulatory
AgentsOxygenation
And

In
COVID-19Conventional
Oxygen
TherapyCOVID-19
patients
with
associated
respiratory
insufficiency
should
be
monitored
closely
with
continuous
pulse
oximetry
.
Supplemental
oxygen
supplementation
via
nasal
cannula
or
Venturi
mask
must
be
administered
to
maintain
oxygen
saturation
(
SpO2
)
between
92
to
96
%
(
<
88-90
%
if

)
.
If
there
is
improvement
in
clinical
and
oxygen

,
supplemental
oxygen
should
be
continued
with
periodic
reassessment
.
If
there
is
no
clinical
improvement
or
worsening
of
symptoms
and/or
oxygen
saturation
,
non-invasive
treatments
such
as
High-Flow
Nasal
Cannula
(

)
or
Noninvasive

Ventilation
(
NIPPV
)
are
recommended.Management
of
Acute
Hypoxemic
Respiratory
Failure
in
COVID-19Acute
hypoxemic
respiratory
failure
is
the
most
common
complication
in
adult
patients
with
COVID-19
,
and
conventional
oxygen
therapy
is
not
helpful
to
address
the
oxygen
demand
in
these
patients
.
These
patients
should
be
managed
with
enhanced
respiratory
support
modalities
such
as
high-flow
nasal
cannula
(
HFNC
)
,
noninvasive
positive
pressure
ventilation
(
NIPPV
)
,
endotracheal
intubation
,
and
invasive
mechanical
ventilation
(
IMV
)
or

)
High-Flow
Nasal
Cannula
(
HFNC
)
and
Noninvasive
Positive

(
NIPPV
)
HFNC
and
NIPPV
are
noninvasive
enhanced
respiratory
support
modalities
available
in
managing
COVID-19-associated
acute
hypoxemic
respiratory
failure
and
are
instrumental
in
avoiding
invasive
mechanical
ventilation
in
carefully
selected
patients
.
A
meta-analysis
study
evaluating
the
effectiveness
of
HFNC
compared
to
conventional
oxygen
therapy
and
NIPPV
before
mechanical
ventilation
reported
that
HFNC
,
when
used
before
mechanical
ventilation
,
could
improve
the
prognosis
of
patients
compared
to
conventional
oxygen
therapy
and
NIPPV
.
[

]
Use
of
HFNC
or
NIPPV
is
associated
with
decreased
dispersion
of
exhaled
air
especially
when
used
with
a
good
interface
fitting
,
thus
creating
a
low
risk
of
nosocomial
transmission
of
the
infection
.

However
,
these
treatment
modalities
are
associated
with

,
raising
concerns

prognosis
of
COVID-19
is
largely
dependent
on
various
factors

,
pre-existing
conditions
,
how

,
the
WHO
’
s
current
estimate
of
the
global
case
fatality
rate
for

is
affected
by
factors
such
as

The
coronavirus
disease
(
COVID-19
)
pandemic
,
which
originated
in
the
city
of
Wuhan
,
China
,
has
quickly
spread
to
various
countries
,
with
many
cases
having
been
reported
worldwide
.
As
of
May
8th
,
2020
,
in
India
,
56,342
positive
cases
have
been
reported
.
India
,
with
a
population
of
more
than
1.34
billion—the
second
largest
population
in
the
world—will
have
difficulty
in
controlling
the
transmission
of
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
2
among
its
population
.
Multiple
strategies
would
be
highly
necessary
to
handle
the
current
outbreak
;
these
include
computational
modeling
,
statistical
tools
,
and
quantitative
analyses
to
control
the
spread
as
well
as
the
rapid
development
of
a
new
treatment
.
The
Ministry
of
Health
and
Family
Welfare
of
India
has
raised
awareness
about
the
recent
outbreak
and
has
taken
necessary
actions
to
control
the
spread
of
COVID-19
.
The
central
and
state
governments
are
taking
several
measures
and
formulating
several
wartime
protocols
to
achieve
this
goal
.
Moreover
,
the
Indian
government
implemented
a
55-days
lockdown
throughout
the
country
that
started
on
March
25th
,
2020
,
to
reduce
the
transmission
of
the
virus
.
This
outbreak
is
inextricably
linked
to
the
economy
of
the
nation
,
as
it
has
dramatically
impeded
industrial
sectors
because
people
worldwide
are
currently
cautious
about
engaging
in
business
in
the
affected
regions.Severe
acute
respiratory

to
many
provinces
in

259,474
worldwide
(

)
.
So
far
,
more
than
212
countries
and
territories
have
confirmed
cases
of
SARS-CoV-2
infection
.
On
January
30th
,
2020
,
the
WHO
declared
COVID-19
a
Public
Health
Emergency
of
International
Concern
(
2
)
.
The
first
SARS-CoV-2
positive
case
in
India
was
reported
in
the
state
of
Kerala
on
January
30th
,
2020
.
Subsequently
,
the
number
of
cases
drastically
rose
.
According
to
the
press
release
by
the
Indian
Council
of
Medical
Research
(
ICMR
)
on
May
8th
,
2020
,
a
total
of
14,37,788
suspected
samples
had
been
sent
to
the
National
Institute
of
Virology
(
NIV
)
,
Pune
,
and
a
related
testing
laboratory
(
3
)
.
Among
them
,
56,342
cases
tested
positive
for
SARS-CoV-2
(

)
.
A
state-wise
distribution
of
positive
cases
until
May
8th
,
2020
,
is
listed
in
Table
1
,
and
the
cases
have
been
depicted
on
an
Indian
map
(
Figure

)
.
Nearly
197,192
Indians
have
recently
been
repatriated
from
affected
regions
,
and
more
than
1,393,301
passengers
have
been
screened
for
SARS-CoV-2
at
Indian
airports
(
5
)
,
with
111
positive
cases
observed
among
foreign
nationals
(

)
.
As
of
May
8th
,
2020
,
Maharashtra
,
Delhi
,
and
Gujarat
states
were
reported
to
be
hotspots
for
COVID-19
with
17,974
,
5,980
,
and
7,012
confirmed
cases
,
respectively
.
To
date
,
16,540
patients
have
recovered
,
and
1,886
deaths
have
been
reported
in
India
(

)
.
To
impose
social
distancing
,
the
“
Janata
curfew
”
(
14-h
lockdown
)
was
ordered
on
March
22nd
,
2020
.
A
further
lockdown
was
initiated
for
21
days
,
starting
on
March
25th
,
2020
,
and
the
same
was
extended
until
May
3rd
,
2020
,
but
,
owing
to
an
increasing
number
of
positive
cases
,
the
lockdown
has
been
extended
for
the
third
time
until
May
17th
,
2020
(
6
)
.
Currently
,
out
of
32
states
and
eight
union
territories
in
India
,
26
states
and
six
union
territories
have
reported
COVID-19
cases
.
Additionally
,
the
health
ministry
has
identified
130
districts
as
hotspot
zones
or
red
zones
,
284
as
orange
zones
(
with
few
SARS-CoV-2
infections
)
,
and
319
as
green
zones
(
no
SARS-CoV-2
infection
)
as
of
May
4th
,
2020
.
These
hotspot
districts
have
been
identified
to
report
more
than
80
%
of
the
cases
across
the
nation
.
Nineteen
districts
in
Uttar
Pradesh
are
identified
as
hotspot
districts
,
and
this
was
followed
by
14
and
12
districts
in
Maharashtra
and
Tamil
Nadu
,
respectively
(
7
)
.
The
complete
lockdown
was
implemented
in
these
containment
zones
to
stop/limit
community
transmission
(
5
)
.
As
of
May
8th
,
2020
,
310
government
laboratories
and
111
private
laboratories
across
the
country
were
involved
in
SARS-CoV-2
testing
.
As
per
ICMR
report
,
14,37,788
samples
were
tested
till
date
,
which
is
1.04
per
thousand
people
(

State-wise
distribution
of
positive
coronavirus
disease
cases
displayed
on
an
Indian
geographical
map.The
recent
outbreak
of
COVID-19
in
several
countries
is
similar
to
the
previous
outbreaks
of
SARS
and
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
(
MERS
)
that
emerged
in
2003
and
2012
in
China
and
Saudi
Arabia
,
respectively
(
8–10
)
.
Coronavirus
is
responsible
for
both
SARS
and
COVID-19
diseases
;
they
affect
the
respiratory
tract
and
cause
major
disease
outbreaks
worldwide
.
SARS
is
caused
by
SARS-CoV
,
whereas
SARS-CoV-2
causes
COVID-19
.
So
far
,
there
is
no
particular
treatment
available
to
treat
SARS
or
COVID-19
.
In
the
current
search
for
a
COVID-19
cure
,
there
is
some
evidence
that
point
to
SARS-CoV-2
being
similar
to
human
coronavirus
HKU1
and
229E
strains
(
11
,
12
)
even
though
they
are
new
coronavirus
family
members
.
These
reports
suggest
that
humans
do
not
have
immunity
to
this
virus
,
allowing
its
easy
and
rapid
spread
among
human
populations
through
contact
with
an
infected
person
.
SARS-CoV-2
is
more
transmissible
than
SARS-CoV
.
The
two
possible
reasons
could
be
(
i
)
the
viral
load
(
quantity
of
virus
)
tends
to
be
relatively
higher
in
COVID-19-positive
patients
,
especially
in
the
nose
and
throat
immediately
after
they
develop
symptoms
,
and
(
ii
)
the
binding
affinity
of
SARS-CoV-2
to
host
cell
receptors
is
higher
than
that
of
SARS-CoV
(
13
,
14
)
.
The
other
comparisons
between
SARS
and
COVID-19
are
tabulated
in
Table
2
,
and
references
for
the
same
are
provided
here
(

.Table

.
Differences
between
coronavirus
disease
and
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome.As
per
the
official
government
guidelines
,
India
is
making
preparations
against
the
COVID-19
outbreak
,
and
avoiding
specific
crisis
actions
or
not
understating
its
importance
will
have
extremely
severe
implications
.
All
the
neighboring
countries
of
India
have
reported
positive
COVID-19
cases
.
To
protect
against
the
deadly
virus
,
the
Indian
government
have
taken
necessary
and
strict
measures
,
including
establishing
health
check
posts
between
the
national
borders
to
test
whether
people
entering
the
country
have
the
virus
(
17
)
.
Different
countries
have
introduced
rescue
efforts
and
surveillance
measures
for
citizens
wishing
to
return
from
China
.
The
lesson
learned
from
the
SARS
outbreak
was
first
that
the
lack
of
clarity
and
information
about
SARS
weakened
China
's
global
standing
and
hampered
its
economic
growth
(
10
,
18–20
)
.
The
outbreak
of
SARS
in
China
was
catastrophic
and
has
led
to
changes
in
health
care
and
medical
systems
(
18
,
20
)
.
Compared
with
China
,
the
ability
of
India
to
counter
a
pandemic
seems
to
be
much
lower
.
A
recent
study
reported
that
affected
family
members
had
not
visit
the
Wuhan
market
in
China
,
suggesting
that
SARS-CoV-2
may
spread
without
manifesting
symptoms
(
21
)
.
Researchers
believe
that
this
phenomenon
is
normal
for
many
viruses
.
India
,
with
a
population
of
more
than
1.34
billion—the
second
largest
population
in
the
world—will
have
difficulty
treating
severe
COVID-19
cases
because
the
country
has
only
49,000
ventilators
,
which
is
a
minimal
amount
.
If
the
number
of
COVID-19
cases
increases
in
the
nation
,
it
would
be
a
catastrophe
for
India
(
22
)
.
It
would
be
difficult
to
identify
sources
of
infection
and
those
who
come
in
contact
with
them
.
This
would
necessitate
multiple
strategies
to
handle
the
outbreak
,
including
computational
modeling
as
well
as
statistical
and
quantitative
analyses
,
to
rapidly
develop
new
vaccines
and
drug
treatments
.
With
such
a
vast
population
,
India
's
medical
system
is
grossly
inadequate
.
A
study
has
shown
that
,
owing
to
inadequate
medical
care
systems
,
nearly
1
million
people
die
every
year
in
India
(
23
)
.
India
is
also
engaged
in
trading
with
its
nearby
countries
,
such
as
Bangladesh
,
Bhutan
,
Pakistan
,
Myanmar
,
China
,
and
Nepal
.
During
the
financial
year
2017–18
(
FY2017–18
)
,
Indian
regional
trade
amounted
to
nearly
$
12
billion
,
accounting
for
only
1.56
%
of
its
total
global
trade
value
of
$
769
billion
.
The
outbreak
of
such
viruses
and
their
transmission
would
significantly
affect
the
Indian
economy
.
The
outbreak
in
China
could
profoundly
affect
the
Indian
economy
,
especially
in
the
sectors
of
electronics
,
pharmaceuticals
,
and
logistics
operations
,
as
trade
ports
with
China
are
currently
closed
.
This
was
further
supported
by
the
statement
by
Suyash
Choudhary
,
Head—Fixed
Income
,
IDFC
AMC
,
stating
that
GDP
might
decrease
owing
to
COVID-19
(
24
)
.Economists
assume
that
the
impact
of
COVID-19
on
the
economy
will
be
high
and
negative
when
compared
with
the
SARS
impact
during
2003
.
For
instance
,
it
has
been
estimated
that
the
number
of
tourists
arriving
in
China
was
much
higher
than
that
of
tourists
who
traveled
during
the
season
when
SARS
emerged
in
2003
.
This
shows
that
COVID-19
has
an
effect
on
the
tourism
industry
.
It
has
been
estimated
that
,
for
SARS
,
there
was
a
57
and
45
%
decline
in
yearly
rail
passenger
and
road
passenger
traffic
,
respectively
(
25
)
.
Moreover
,
when
compared
with
the
world
economy
15
years
ago
,
world
economies
are
currently
much
more
inter-related
.
It
has
been
estimated
that
COVID-19
will
hurt
emerging
market
currencies
and
also
impact
oil
prices
(
26–28
)
.
From
the
retail
industry
's
perspective
,
consumer
savings
seem
to
be
high
.
This
might
have
an
adverse
effect
on
consumption
rates
,
as
all
supply
chains
are
likely
to
be
affected
,
which
in
turn
would
have
its
impact
on
supply
when
compared
with
the
demand
of
various
necessary
product
items
(
29
)
.
This
clearly
proves
that
,
based
on
the
estimated
losses
due
to
the
effect
of
SARS
on
tourism
(
retail
sales
lost
around
USD
12–18
billion
and
USD
30–100
billion
was
lost
at
a
global
macroeconomic
level
)
,
we
can
not
estimate
the
impact
of
COVID-19
at
this
point
.
This
will
be
possible
only
when
the
spread
of
COVID-19
is
fully
controlled
.
Until
that
time
,
any
estimates
will
be
rather
ambiguous
and
imprecise
(
19
)
.
The
OECD
Interim
economic
assessment
has
provided
briefing
reports
highlighting
the
role
of
China
in
the
global
supply
chain
and
commodity
markets
.
Japan
,
South
Korea
,
and
Australia
are
the
countries
that
are
most
susceptible
to
adverse
effects
,
as
they
have
close
ties
with
China
.
It
has
been
estimated
that
there
has
been
a
20
%
decline
in
car
sales
,
which
was
10
%
of
the
monthly
decline
in
China
during
January
2020
.
This
shows
that
even
industrial
production
has
been
affected
by
COVID-19
.
So
far
,
several
factors
have
thus
been
identified
as
having
a
major
economic
impact
:
labor
mobility
,
lack
of
working
hours
,
interruptions
in
the
global
supply
chain
,
less
consumption
,
and
tourism
,
and
less
demand
in
the
commodity
market
at
a
global
level
(
30
)
,
which
in
turn
need
to
be
adequately
analyzed
by
industry
type
.
Corporate
leaders
need
to
prioritize
the
supply
chain
and
product
line
economy
trends
via
demand
from
the
consumer
end
.
Amidst
several
debates
on
sustainable
economy
before
the
COVID-19
impact
,
it
has
now
been
estimated
that
India
's
GDP
by
the
International
Monetary
Fund
has
been
cut
down
to
1.9
%
from
5.8
%
for
the
FY21
.
The
financial
crisis
that
has
emerged
owing
to
the
worldwide
lockdown
reflects
its
adverse
effect
on
several
industries
and
the
global
supply
chain
,
which
has
resulted
in
the
GDP
dropping
to
4.2
%
for
FY20
,
which
was
previously
estimated
at
4.8
%
.
Nevertheless
,
it
has
been
roughly
estimated
that
India
and
China
will
be
experiencing
considerable
positive
growth
among
other
major
economies
(
31
)
.An
easy
way
to
decrease
SARS-CoV-2
infection
rates
is
to
avoid
virus
exposure
.
People
from
India
should
avoid
traveling
to
countries
highly
affected
with
the
virus
,
practice
proper
hygiene
,
and
avoid
consuming
food
that
is
not
home
cooked
.
Necessary
preventive
measures
,
such
as
wearing
a
mask
,
regular
hand
washing
,
and
avoiding
direct
contact
with
infected
persons
,
should
also
be
practiced
.
The
Ministry
of
Health
and
Family
Welfare
(
MOHFW
)
,
India
,
has
raised
awareness
about
the
recent
outbreak
and
taken
necessary
action
to
control
COVID-19
.
Besides
,
the
MOHFW
has
created
a
24
h/7
days-a-week
disease
alert
helpline
(
+91-11-23978046
and
1800-180-1104
)
and
policy
guidelines
on
surveillance
,
clinical
management
,
infection
prevention
and
control
,
sample
collection
,
transportation
,
and
discharging
suspected
or
confirmed
cases
(

,

)
.
Those
who
traveled
from
China
,
or
other
countries
,
and
exhibited
symptoms
,
including
fever
,
difficulty
in
breathing
,
sore
throat
,
cough
,
and
breathlessness
,
were
asked
to
visit
the
nearest
hospital
for
a
health
check-up
.
Officials
from
seven
different
airports
,
including
Chennai
,
Cochin
,
New
Delhi
,
Kolkata
,
Hyderabad
,
and
Bengaluru
,
have
been
ordered
to
screen
and
monitor
Indian
travelers
from
China
and
other
affected
countries
.
In
addition
,
a
travel
advisory
was
released
to
request
the
cessation
of
travel
to
affected
countries
,
and
anyone
with
a
travel
history
that
has
included
China
since
January
15th
,
2020
,
would
be
quarantined
.
A
centralized
control
room
has
been
set
up
by
the
Delhi
government
at
the
Directorate
General
of
Health
Services
,
and
11
other
districts
have
done
the
same
.
India
has
implemented
COVID-19

advisory
for
intra-
and
inter-passenger

.India
is
known
for
its
traditional
medicines
in
the
form
of
AYUSH
(
Ayurvedic
,
Yoga
and
Naturopathy
,
Unani
,
Siddha
,
and

.
The
polyherbal
powder
NilavembuKudineer
showed
promising
effects
against
dengue
and
chikungunya
fevers
in
the
past
(

.
With
the
outbreak
of
COVID-19
,
the
ministry
of
AYUSH
has
released
a
press
note
“
Advisory
for
Coronavirus
,
”
mentioning
useful
medications
to
improve
the
immunity
of
the
individuals
(

.
Currently
,
according
to
the
ICMR
guidelines
,
doctors
prescribe
a
combination
of
Lopinavir
and
Ritonavir
for
severe
COVID-19
cases
and
hydroxychloroquine
for
prophylaxis
of
SARS-CoV-2
infection
(
34
,
35
)
.
In
collaboration
with
the
WHO
,
ICMR
will
conduct
a
therapeutic
trial
for
COVID-19
in
India
(

)
.
The
ICMR
recommends
using
the
US-FDA-approved
closed
real-time
RT-PCR
systems
,
such
as
GeneXpert
and
Roche
COBAS-6800/8800
,
which
are
used
to
diagnose
chronic
myeloid
leukemia
and
melanoma
,
respectively
(

.
In
addition
,
the
TruenatTM
beta
CoV
test
on
the
TruelabTM
workstation
validated
by
the
ICMR
is
recommended
as
a
screening
test
.
All
positive
results
obtained
on
this
platform
need
to
be
confirmed
by
confirmatory
assays
for

All
negative
results
do
not
require
further
testing

As
a
step
further
,
on
the
technological
aspect
,
the
Union
Health
Ministry
has
launched
a
mobile
application
called
“
AarogyaSetu
”
that
works
both
on
android
and
iOS
mobile
phones
.
This
application
constructs
a
user
database
for
establishing
an
awareness
network
that
can
alert
people
and
governments
about
possible
COVID-19
victims
(
37
)
.Infections
caused
by
these
viruses
are
an
enormous
global
health
threat
.
They
are
a
major
cause
of
death
and
have
adverse
socio-economic
effects
that
are
continually
exacerbated
.
Therefore
,
potential
treatment
initiatives
and
approaches
need
to
be
developed
.
First
,
India
is
taking
necessary
preventive
measures
to
reduce
viral
transmission
.
Second
,
ICMR
and
the
Ministry
of
AYUSH
provided
guidelines
to
use
conventional
preventive
and
treatment
strategies
to
increase
immunity
against
COVID-19
(
3
,
38
)
.
These
guidelines
could
help
reduce
the
severity
of
the
viral
infection
in
elderly
patients
and
increase
life
expectancy
(
39
)
.
The
recent
report
from
the
director
of
ICMR
mentioned
that
India
would
undergo
randomized
controlled
trials
using
convalescent
plasma
of
completely
recovered
COVID-19
patients
.
Convalescent
plasma
therapy
is
highly
recommended
,
as
it
has
provided
moderate
success
with
SARS
and
MERS
(
40
)
;
this
has
been
rolled
out
in
20
health
centers
and
will
be
increased
this
month
(
May
2020
)
(
3
)
.
India
has
expertise
in
specialized
medical/pharmaceutical
industries
with
production
facilities
,
and
the
government
has
established
fast-tracking
research
to
develop
rapid
diagnostic
test
kits
and
vaccines
at
low
cost
(
41
)
.
In
addition
,
the
Serum
Institute
of
India
started
developing
a
vaccine
against
SARS-CoV-2
infection
(
42
)
.
Until
we
obtain
an
appropriate
vaccine
,
it
is
highly
recommended
that
we
screen
the
red
zoned
areas
to
stop
further
transmission
of
the
virus
.
Medical
college
doctors
in
Kerala
,
India
,
implemented
the
low-cost
WISK
(
Walk-in
Sample
Kiosk
)
to
collect
samples
without
direct
exposure
or
contact
(
43
,
44
)
.
After
Kerala
,
The
Defense
Research
and
Development
Organization
(
DRDO
)
developed
walk-in
kiosks
to
collect
COVID-19
samples
and
named
these
as
COVID-19
Sample
Collection
Kiosk
(
COVSACK
)
(
45
)
.
After
the
swab
collection
,
the
testing
of
SARS-CoV-2
can
be
achieved
with
the
existing
diagnostic
facility
in
India
.
This
facility
can
be
used
for
massive
screening
or
at
least
in
the
red
zoned
areas
without
the
need
for
personal
protective
equipment
kits
(
43
,
45
)
.
India
has
attempted
to
broaden
its
research
facilities
and
shift
toward
testing
the
mass
population
,
as
recommended
by
medical
experts
in
India
and
worldwide
(
46
)
.Publicly
available
datasets
were
analyzed
in
this
study
.

data

Viral
variants
of
concern
may
emerge
with
dangerous
resistance
to
the
immunity
generated
by
the
current
vaccines
to
prevent
coronavirus
disease
2019
(
Covid-19
)
.
Moreover
,
if
some
variants
of
concern
have
increased
transmissibility
or
virulence
,
the
importance
of
efficient
public
health
measures
and
vaccination
programs
will
increase
.
The
global
response
must
be
both
timely
and
science
based.In
addition
to
continuing
to
track
the
emergence
of
new
variants
of
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
2
(
SARS-CoV-2
)
,
there
are
four
major
priorities
for
the
global
response
to
variants
of
concern
(
Table
1
)
.
These
priorities
,
which
involve
scientific
approaches
for
evaluating
existing
vaccines
and
developing
modified
and
new
vaccines
,
are
to
determine
whether
existing
vaccines
are
losing
efficacy
against
variants
,
to
decide
whether
modified
or
new
vaccines
are
warranted
to
restore
efficacy
against
variants
,
to
reduce
the
likelihood
that
variants
of
concern
will
emerge
,
and
to
coordinate
international
research
and
the
response
to
new
variants
,
both
in
general
and
in
relation
to
vaccines
,
through
the
World
Health
Organization
(
WHO
)
.Efforts
to
track
viral
mutations
and
variants
are
ongoing
.
The
aim
is
to
detect
new
changes
quickly
and
to
assess
their
possible
effects
.
Many
research
groups
are
sequencing
virus
isolates
and
sharing
these
sequences
on
public
databases
such
as
GISAID
(
Global
Initiative
on
Sharing
All
Influenza
Data
)
.1
This
collaboration
helps
scientists
track
the
ways
in
which
the
virus
is
evolving
.
In
order
to
help
monitor
and
respond
to
the
evolving
pandemic
,
it
is
important
that
all
countries
increase
the
collection
of
virus
isolates
for
sequencing
and
sharing
.
A
SARS-CoV-2
risk-monitoring
and
evaluation
framework
is
being
developed
and
continually
improved
by
the
WHO
to
identify
and
assess
variants
of
concern
.
This
framework
,
which
involves
enhanced
surveillance
,
research
on
variants
of
interest
and
variants
of
concern
,
and
evaluation
of
the
effect
of
variants
on
diagnostic
tests
,
therapeutic
agents
,
and
vaccines
,
will
assist
in
global
decision
making
regarding
changes
in
vaccines
that
may
be
necessary.Variants
of
concern
with
increased
transmissibility
are
contributing
to
the
reversal
of
the
decreases
in
Covid-19
case
counts
that
occurred
in
many
countries
earlier
this
year.2
The
B.1.1.7
(
or
alpha
)
variant
of
concern
increases
viral
transmissibility3
and
is
emerging
as
an
increasingly
common
variant
.
The
P.1
(
or
gamma
)
variant
may
cause
severe
disease
even
in
persons
who
have
been
previously
infected
,
although
definitive
information
is
lacking.4
The
B.1.351
(
or
beta
)
variant
is
less
easily
neutralized
by
convalescent
plasma
obtained
from
patients
infected
with
previous
variants
and
by
serum
obtained
from
vaccinees
than
the
prototype
virus
on
which
vaccine
antigens
are
based,5
and
preliminary
evidence
(
based
on
data
from
post
hoc
subgroups
in
placebo-controlled
vaccine
trials
)
suggests
reduced
efficacy
of
some
vaccines
against
mild
or
moderate
disease
caused
by
this
variant.6-8
Additional
variants
that
are
responsible
for
many
deaths
,
such
as
B.1.617.2
(
or
delta
)
,9
continue
to
emerge
.
So
far
,
there
is
no
good
evidence
that
currently
identified
variants
of
concern
evade
the
most
important
vaccine
effect
—
that
of
prevention
of
severe
disease
.
Table
2
describes
key
properties
of
and
mutations
in
five
selected
variants
.
The
fact
that
a
few
key
amino
acids
in
the
spike
protein
have
changed
independently
in
variants
identified
in
various
parts
of
the
world
indicates
that
these
are
convergent
changes
and
suggests
that
vaccines
that
incorporate
these
selected
residues
could
cover
several
variants.Although
animal
models
and
in
vitro
studies
can
provide
important
information
,
clinical
data
will
continue
to
be
needed
to
determine
whether
existing
vaccines
are
losing
efficacy
against
variants
.
While
existing
vaccines
are
being
deployed
,
clinical
data
can
be
sought
not
only
from
carefully
planned
observational
studies
,
but
also
from
randomized
trials
of
vaccines
versus
placebo
,
of
one
vaccine
versus
another
,
or
of
different
vaccination
regimens
(
e.g.
,
different
doses
,
numbers
of
doses
,
and
intervals
between
doses
)
.In
areas
where
the
vaccine
supply
or
delivery
capacity
is
limited
,
instead
of
letting
operational
decisions
determine
the
order
in
which
people
are
vaccinated
,
making
first
vaccine
doses
available
to
some
of
the
target
population
on
a
randomized
basis
could
provide
useful
information
about
efficacy
against
major
variants
.
This
is
especially
true
if
the
numbers
of
participants
who
undergo
randomization
are
large
enough
to
allow
assessment
of
“
hard
”
end
points
such
as
hospitalization
or
severe
disease.If
large-scale
randomization
were
used
during
vaccine
deployment
to
compare
the
effects
of
early
second
doses
with
those
of
delayed
second
doses
,
any
differences
in
efficacy
could
be
reliably
assessed
not
only
overall
but
perhaps
with
respect
to
certain
common
variants
.
In
some
populations
,
random
assignment
of
the
vaccination
date
or
location
might
be
built
into
public
health
programs
,
and
persons
who
become
eligible
for
vaccination
(
according
to
vaccine
priority
groupings
)
could
be
randomly
assigned
to
receive
appointments
to
be
vaccinated
with
a
longer
or
a
shorter
gap
between
doses
or
to
receive
one
vaccine
or
another
.
This
strategy
might
allow
many
hundreds
of
thousands
of
persons
to
undergo
randomization
with
little
cost
to
the
vaccination
program
and
with
little
or
no
disturbance
of
the
existing
vaccination
capacity
(
Figure
1
)
.
At
the
opposite
extreme
of
trial
size
,
if
any
vaccines
were
known
to
have
the
potential
to
prevent
Covid-19
even
when
administered
after
an
exposure
to
SARS-CoV-2
,
relatively
small
,
randomized
studies
of
postexposure
prophylaxis
could
provide
important
insights
about
vaccine
efficacy
(
or
relative
efficacy
)
against
different
strains.Nonrandomized
observational
studies
that
attempt
to
estimate
vaccine
effectiveness
are
all
prone
to
some
bias
.
Nevertheless
,
in
areas
where
several
variants
are
cocirculating
and
some
but
not
all
of
the
population
has
been
vaccinated
,
carefully
designed
observational
studies
of
the
distribution
of
viral
genotypes
among
cases
in
vaccinated
and
unvaccinated
persons
could
yield
fairly
reliable
estimates
of
relative
vaccine
efficacy
against
various
variants
.
Such
studies
should
account
for
potential
confounding
if
the
level
of
vaccination
is
correlated
with
the
relative
prevalence
of
variants
across
sites
.
Observational
studies
could
also
detect
loss
of
protection
against
variants
of
concern
in
previously
infected
persons.Observational
studies
lack
precision
when
either
vaccine
uptake
or
variant
prevalence
is
too
low
or
too
high
for
statistical
stability
,
but
they
could
provide
insights
if
cases
and
controls
are
adequately
matched
for
potential
confounders
(
e.g.
,
in
a
“
test-negative
design
”
10
)
.
There
are
ways
to
at
least
limit
confounding
for
such
studies
in
general11
and
for
test-negative
studies
in
particular.12,13Creative
methodologic
approaches
are
still
needed
to
assess
any
influences
of
variants
of
concern
on
vaccine
efficacy
and
durability
.
In
studies
of
vaccine
efficacy
and
effectiveness
against
variants
of
concern
,
near-complete
sequencing
of
isolates
from
selected
sentinel
sites
can
reduce
biases
in
the
selection
of
samples
for
sequencing
.
Sequencing
capacity
is
lacking
in
many
parts
of
the
world
and
should
be
increased
.
Samples
obtained
from
unselected
vaccine
recipients
with
breakthrough
infection
and
from
matched
unvaccinated
controls
could
be
used
to
assess
the
influence
of
particular
genomic
or
antigenic
features
of
interest
on
vaccine
efficacy
.
With
the
use
of
such
approaches
(
i.e.
,
“
sieve
analyses
”
14
)
in
trials
or
in
studies
conducted
after
vaccine
deployment
,
important
insights
could
be
gleaned
about
the
relevance
of
particular
viral
features
,
and
these
insights
may
lead
to
improved
strain
selection
in
the
formulation
of
modified
vaccines.How
reliably
any
immune
biomarker
can
serve
as
a
“
correlate
of
protection
”
is
not
yet
known
.
The
effects
of
vaccination
on
such
biomarkers
(
as
surrogate
end
points
)
—
if
those
biomarkers
prove
to
be
reliably
predictive
of
the
effects
of
vaccine
on
the
incidence
or
outcome
of
breakthrough
infections
—
could
provide
support
for
regulatory
action
regarding
new
candidate
vaccines
.
However
,
caveats
include
the
potential
dependence
of
immune
correlates
of
protection
on
vaccine-specific
factors
,
viral
strain
,
and
the
choice
of
Covid-19
study
end
points
(
i.e.
,
any
infection
vs.
symptomatic
infection
vs.
severe
disease
)
.Although
there
will
be
reluctance
to
deploy
vaccines
that
are
based
on
new
sequences
before
there
is
clear
evidence
that
the
original
vaccines
are
failing
,
there
will
also
be
reluctance
to
allow
prolonged
circulation
of
vaccine-resistant
variants
while
new
vaccines
or
modified
vaccines
are
being
developed
,
if
this
can
be
avoided
.
Now
is
the
time
to
plan
for
the
development
of
modified
vaccines
that
could
protect
against
vaccine-resistant
variants
,
because
such
variants
may
well
emerge
.
Planning
should
include
the
effect
of
vaccine
modification
on
timelines
for
vaccine
supply
and
rollout.Studies
of
modified
vaccines
(
i.e.
,
vaccines
in
which
a
new
antigen
is
delivered
through
a
vaccine
that
has
already
been
shown
to
be
effective
against
previously
circulating
viral
variants
)
should
address
the
ability
of
these
vaccines
to
elicit
responses
in
persons
who
have
not
previously
had
an
immunologic
response
against
SARS-CoV-2
and
in
previously
vaccinated
persons
.
Changes
in
the
in
vitro
neutralization
of
circulating
strains
by
vaccine-induced
antibodies
may
not
imply
waning
effectiveness
.
Although
neutralizing
responses
may
not
be
reliably
predictive
of
vaccine
efficacy
,
striking
differences
may
well
provide
sufficient
support
for
regulatory
decisions
.
For
example
,
the
magnitude
of
the
immune
response
against
one
or
more
variants
of
concern
after
a
person
has
received
a
modified
vaccine
could
be
compared
with
that
against
the
prototype
virus
after
a
person
has
received
the
original
vaccine
that
is
known
to
be
effective
.
Assessment
of
neutralizing
responses
against
several
variants
of
concern
and
against
the
prototype
virus
may
help
to
determine
whether
more
than
one
vaccine
(
or
,
ultimately
,
a
polyvalent
vaccine
)
is
needed.There
has
been
consensus
in
recent
regulatory
discussions15
and
in
WHO
guidance
that
conventional
,
large
,
clinical
end-point
trials
are
probably
not
necessary
in
order
to
introduce
modified
vaccines
against
variants
of
concern
.
Because
differences
among
assays
of
immune
responses
may
complicate
direct
comparisons
,
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(
but
not
the
European
Medicines
Agency
)
has
proposed
that
animal
models16
could
be
used
to
provide
further
support
for
the
effectiveness
of
modified
vaccines
against
variants
of
concern.Even
with
the
deployment
of
some
safe
and
effective
vaccines
,
more
will
be
needed
to
address
the
international
pandemic
.
New
vaccines
may
be
more
effective
than
previous
vaccines
against
emerging
viral
variants
,
and
they
may
be
administered
in
a
single
dose
,
be
noninjectable
,
avoid
cold-chain
constraints
,
or
have
improved
manufacturing
scalability
.
The
design
of
modified
vaccines
or
of
completely
new
vaccines
should
leverage
international
recommendations
regarding
antigenic
composition.Trials
of
new
vaccines
can
still
yield
reliable
and
interpretable
results
in
an
efficient
manner
by
using
randomization
,
by
evaluating
effects
not
only
on
immunologic
but
also
on
clinical
end
points
,
and
by
using
placebo
controls
when
ethically
appropriate,17,18
perhaps
in
communities
where
vaccine
supply
is
very
limited
or
in
subpopulations
(
e.g.
,
young
adults
)
in
which
even
if
infection
occurs
,
the
probability
of
progression
to
serious
disease
is
very
low.19,20
Randomized
trials
require
additional
planning
,
but
when
practicable
they
prevent
unidentified
trial
design–related
differences
from
confounding
the
study
results.21
Viral
genotyping
in
persons
with
breakthrough
infection
(
during
or
after
trials
)
can
support
multiple
analyses
,
including
assessment
of
the
influence
of
viral
variants
on
vaccine
efficacy
.
In
randomized
,
controlled
studies
,
such
genotyping
also
yields
unbiased
information
about
variant-specific
efficacy
.
Countries
that
participate
in
such
trials
may
assess
vaccine
efficacy
against
locally
prevalent
viral
strains
and
should
receive
priority
access
to
trial
vaccines
if
they
have
been
shown
to
have
an
acceptable
safety
profile
and
to
be
efficacious
(
Table
3
)
.
In
areas
where
placebo-controlled
trials
of
new
vaccines
are
not
appropriate
,
the
use
of
an
active
comparator
could
still
yield
important
results.22
However
,
the
validity
of
a
noninferiority
trial
in
which
an
active
comparator
vaccine
is
used
as
the
control
is
dependent
on
the
ability
of
the
previous
studies
of
the
active
comparator
to
provide
investigators
with
reliable
insights
about
the
efficacy
of
the
active
comparator
vaccine
against
viral
variants
that
are
currently
present
in
communities
engaged
in
the
trial.Once
modified
vaccines
or
completely
new
vaccines
that
address
new
variants
have
been
introduced
,
the
cycle
can
begin
anew
with
monitoring
for
even
newer
variants
that
might
necessitate
further
changes
in
the
vaccine
antigen
sequence
.
Development
and
deployment
strategies
should
account
for
the
possibility
that
multiple
variants
may
circulate
in
the
same
area
.
Studies
in
which
one
vaccine
is
boosted
with
a
later
dose
of
another
would
also
be
valuable.Variants
of
concern
have
been
evolving
since
the
beginning
of
the
Covid-19
pandemic
,
with
selective
advantage
generally
favoring
more
transmissible
variants
.
Variants
of
concern
with
resistance
against
natural
or
vaccine-induced
immunity
would
probably
supplant
previously
circulating
strains
only
if
this
immune
evasion
capability
resulted
in
increased
fitness
,
including
transmissibility
.
Given
the
emergence
of
immunity-evading
variants
even
before
vaccines
were
broadly
deployed
,
it
is
hard
to
implicate
vaccines
or
vaccine
deployment
strategies
as
the
major
drivers
of
immune
evasion.However
,
prolonged
viral
replication
in
the
presence
of
partial
immunity
in
immunocompromised
persons
or
circumstances
in
which
rapid
transmission
of
high
titers
of
virus
occurs
(
e.g.
,
crowded
living
conditions23
)
could
have
contributed
to
the
development
of
variants
that
can
at
least
partially
escape
human
immune
responses
.
The
use
of
antibody-based
treatments
(
e.g.
,
monoclonal
antibodies
or
convalescent
plasma
)
in
circumstances
in
which
they
are
of
limited
or
undemonstrated
efficacy
may
further
contribute
to
the
evolution
of
variants
of
concern
that
could
evade
not
only
these
but
also
other
antibody
responses.24
Partially
effective
interventions
may
therefore
encourage
viral
evolution
.
In
addition
,
the
larger
the
number
of
infected
persons
,
the
greater
the
chance
that
new
variants
of
concern
will
arise
.
Hence
,
effective
public
health
strategies
such
as
social
distancing
,
the
use
of
masks
,
and
the
targeted
use
of
effective
vaccines
that
reduce
both
infection
and
transmission
can
help
to
limit
viral
evolution
.
Limiting
transmission
in
the
general
population
is
extremely
important
for
slowing
the
emergence
of
additional
variants
of
concern.Globally
,
vaccines
are
being
rolled
out
slowly
,
partly
because
of
limitations
on
production
capacity
and
“
vaccine
nationalism
,
”
25
and
in
many
countries
supplies
will
probably
be
limited
even
in
late
2021
.
Currently
,
the
main
strategy
is
to
protect
critical
services
,
persons
in
whom
severe
disease
is
most
likely
to
develop
(
e.g.
,
older
adults
)
,
and
persons
who
are
likely
to
transmit
the
virus
to
vulnerable
populations
(
e.g.
,
health
care
,
frontline
,
and
essential
workers
)
,
and
to
contain
the
spread
of
the
virus
in
the
general
population
.
The
balance
between
using
vaccines
to
protect
persons
from
disease
and
using
vaccines
to
target
prevention
of
spread
involves
a
strategic
decision
that
should
be
informed
by
reliable
epidemiologic
information.In
some
epidemics
,
complete
disease
elimination
has
been
achieved
efficiently
by
using
an
epidemiologic
understanding
of
transmission
to
target
the
deployment
of
vaccines
(
e.g.
,
vaccinating
“
rings
”
of
contacts
and
contacts
of
contacts
around
cases
of
smallpox
or
Ebola26-28
)
.
Together
with
other
public
health
measures
,
targeting
vaccination
to
persons
in
certain
areas
or
to
demographic
groups
with
a
high
incidence
of
infection
rather
than
focusing
only
on
persons
at
high
risk
for
serious
disease
could
slow
transmission
and
reduce
the
risk
of
development
of
additional
variants
of
concern
,
although
no
strategy
can
work
if
adequate
vaccine
supplies
are
unavailable
.
Targeted
approaches
are
now
being
investigated
.
For
example
,
in
certain
areas
,
the
deployment
of
some
vaccines
in
a
modified
ring
vaccination
strategy
has
been
suggested.29
Studies
of
the
effectiveness
of
such
targeted
strategies
could
be
of
global
relevance
,
especially
if
groups
or
areas
with
consistently
high
and
low
rates
of
transmission
can
be
identified.New
variants
of
concern
may
emerge
in
any
corner
of
the
world
and
spread
quickly
,
and
convergent
changes
have
been
noted
in
variants
of
concern
identified
in
various
parts
of
the
world
.
The
modification
of
sequences
targeted
by
a
vaccine
to
meet
the
needs
of
one
country
could
have
repercussions
elsewhere
.
Therefore
,
vaccine
development
,
vaccine
modification
,
and
vaccine
deployment
should
be
viewed
as
international
enterprises
,
with
international
coordination
by
the
WHO
helping
benefits
to
accrue
throughout
the
world.Coordination
is
essential
in
assessing
the
need
for
new
or
modified
vaccines
,
in
evaluating
them
,
and
in
facilitating
scientific
understanding
of
the
risk
posed
by
novel
variants
and
of
the
relationships
between
genetic
variation
and
antigenic
escape
.
Open
and
frequent
scientific
discussion
is
necessary
to
identify
which
variants
of
concern
require
attention
.
Criteria
are
needed
to
assess
the
appropriateness
of
given
vaccines
and
the
likely
effect
of
emerging
variants
on
vaccines
,
as
well
as
to
support
recommendations
on
the
development
and
evaluation
of
modified
vaccines
and
new
vaccines
and
the
timing
of
their
deployment
.
This
process
can
build
on
the
global
framework
used
periodically
by
the
WHO
to
coordinate
the
selection
of
antigens
in
influenza
vaccines
(
Figure
2
)
.Decision
making
about
which
antigens
should
be
included
in
vaccines
against
SARS-CoV-2
will
need
to
involve
epidemiologic
data
,
data
from
evolutionary
biology
,
and
clinical
,
animal
,
and
in
vitro
data
that
are
pertinent
to
immune
responses
and
to
continued
vaccine
efficacy
in
the
face
of
changing
viral
sequences
and
the
possible
waning
of
vaccine-induced
immunity
.
Meeting
these
challenges
efficiently
will
require
enhanced
surveillance
with
continued
sharing
of
data
(
including
viral
sequences
and
corresponding
antigens
that
are
linked
to
clinical
and
epidemiologic
information
)
and
samples
(
including
new
viral
variant
isolates
and
serum
samples
obtained
from
vaccinated
persons
)
.
It
will
also
require
the
use
of
standardized
reference
reagents
and
models
to
evaluate
viruses
and
modified
vaccines
.
With
collaborative
,
open
discussion
of
results
,
this
data
sharing
will
help
foster
consistent
and
thoughtful
public
communications
about
new
variants
and
help
maintain
appropriate
confidence
in
vaccines
and
in
the
processes
used
to
develop
,
test
,
and
deploy
them.Although
Covid-19
continues
to
present
public
health
challenges
,
including
the
emergence
of
new
variants
,
great
progress
has
been
made
in
understanding
this
disease
and
how
to
protect
against
it
.
Even
though
existing
vaccines
are
helping
to
bring
the
pandemic
under
control
in
some
locations
,
it
is
also
necessary
to
plan
for
unsatisfactory
outcomes
.
As
this
planning
continues
,
international
coordination
by
the
WHO
of
research
efforts
and
sharing
of
data
and
specimens
should
be
a
priority
.
Maintaining
the
efficacy
of
vaccines
against
emerging
variants
and
achieving
equitable
access
to
effective
vaccines
in
all
countries
will
be
of
utmost
importance
as
a
sustainable
response
is
built
.
A
weak
immune
response
to
two
doses
of
vaccine
against
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
2
(
SARS-CoV-2
)
has
been
observed
in
recipients
of
solid-organ
transplants.1,2
Severe
cases
of
coronavirus
disease
2019
(
Covid-19
)
have
also
been
reported
in
transplant
recipients
who
had
received
two
doses
of
vaccine.3
These
reports
prompted
the
French
National
Authority
for
Health
to
recommend
the
use
of
a
third
dose
in
immunosuppressed
patients.4
Here
,
we
report
the
humoral
response
in
a
group
of
101
consecutive
solid-organ
transplant
recipients
(

)
who
were
given
three
doses
of
the

BNT162b2
(
Pfizer–BioNTech
)
.
The
group
included
78
kidney-transplant
recipients
,
12
liver-transplant
recipients
,
8
lung-transplant
or
heart-transplant
recipients
,
and
3
pancreas-transplant
recipients
.
The
first
two
doses
were
given
1
month
apart
,
and
the
third
dose
was
administered
61±1
days
after
the
second
dose
.
The
time
between
transplantation
and
the
initiation
of
vaccination
was
97±8
months
.
Immunosuppression
was
due
to
the
use
of
glucocorticoids
(
in
87
%
of
patients
)
,
calcineurin
inhibitors
(
in
79

inhibitors
(
in

%
of

)
,
and
belatacept
(
in
12
%
of
patients
)
.
The
levels
of
antibodies
to
SARS-CoV-2
spike
protein
were
assessed
in
all
the
patients
with
the
use
of
the
Wantai
enzyme-linked

According
to

,
because

26
(

their

to
2676±350
1
month
after
the

(

.
Patients
who
did
not
have
an
antibody
response
were
older
,
had
a
higher
degree
of
immunosuppression
,
and
had
a

As
of
this
writing
,
Covid-19
had
not
developed
in
any
of
the
patients
after
they
received
the
three
vaccine
doses
.
No
serious
adverse
events
were
reported
after
the
administration
of
the
third
dose
,
and
no
acute
rejection
episodes
occurred.This
study
showed
that
administration
of
a
third
dose
of
the
BNT162b2
vaccine
to
solid-organ
transplant
recipients
significantly
improved
the
immunogenicity
of
the
vaccine
,
with
no
cases
of
Covid-19
reported
in
any
of
the
patients
.
However
,
a
large
proportion
of
the
patients
remain
at
risk
for
Covid-19
.
Barrier
measures
should
be
maintained
,
and
vaccination
of
the

of
these

should
be
encouraged.Nassim

higher
with
Ad26.COV2.S
than
with
placebo
but
was
generally
mild
to
moderate
and
transient
.
The
incidence
of
serious
adverse
events
was
balanced
between
the
two
groups
.
Three
deaths
occurred
in
the
vaccine
group
(
none
were
Covid-19–related
)
,
and
16
in
the
placebo
group
(
5
were
Covid-19–related
)
.A
single
dose
of
Ad26.COV2.S
protected
against
symptomatic
Covid-19
and
asymptomatic
SARS-CoV-2
infection
and
was
effective
against
severe–critical
disease
,
including
hospitalization
and
death
.
Safety
appeared
to
be
similar
to
that
in
other
phase

Since
emerging
in

2019
,
the
severe
acute
respiratory

Vaccines
to

coronavirus
disease
2019
(
Covid-19
)
have
been
developed
with
unprecedented
speed.5,6The
Ad26.COV2.S

vector7
encoding
a
full-length
,
membrane-bound

in
a
prefusion-stabilized
conformation.8,9
Other
Ad26-based
vaccines
,
including
an
approved
Ebola
vaccine
,
are
safe
and
have
induced
durable
immune
responses.8,10-13
Ad26.COV2.S
induced
durable
protection
at
low
doses
in
preclinical
SARS-CoV-2
challenge
studies,8,14
and
initial
clinical
data
showed
that
a
single
dose
at
5×1010
viral
particles
was
safe
and
induced
excellent
humoral
and
cellular
immune
responses.9
Ad26.COV2.S
can
be
stored
for
up
to
2
years
in
a
standard
freezer
and
up
to
3
months
at
refrigerator
temperatures
,
which
simplifies
transport
,
storage

and
use
in
a
pandemic.We
are
conducting
an

to
evaluate
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
a

Participants
were

ratio
,
with
the
use
of
randomly
permuted
blocks
,
to
receive
either
Ad26.COV2.S

.
Randomization
was
conducted
with
an
interactive
Web-response
system
and
stratified
according
to

,
and
the
presence
or
absence
of
coexisting

with
an
increased
risk
of
severe
Covid-19.Vaccine
or
placebo
was
administered
on
day
1
.
Ad26.COV2.S
was
supplied
in
single-use
vials
at
a
concentration
of
1×1011
viral
particles
per
milliliter
and
was
administered
at
a
dose
of
5×1010
viral
particles
as
a
single
intramuscular
injection
(
0.5
ml
)
by
a
health
care
worker
who
was
unaware
of
the
group
assignment.Participants
reported
Covid-19
symptoms
electronically
using
the
Symptoms

Infection
with
Coronavirus-19
questionnaire
(
methods
described
in
Fig
.
S1
in
the
Supplementary
Appendix
)
.
Participants
and
trial
staff
obtained
nasal
swabs
,
which
were
tested
with
the
use
of
a
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(
FDA
)
Emergency
Use
Authorization
reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction
(
RT-PCR
)
assay
for
SARS-CoV-2
at
a
local
laboratory
and
subsequently
confirmed
centrally
(
m-2000
SARS-CoV-2
real-time
RT-PCR
,
Abbott
)
.
Seropositivity
for
SARS-CoV-2
was
evaluated
by
means
of
a
SARS-CoV-2
nucleocapsid
(
N
)
immunoassay
(
Elecsys
,
Roche
)
at
trial
entry
and
on
days
29
and
71
.
Assays
were
performed
according
to
the
manufacturers
’
protocols.Primary
and
key
secondary
efficacy
evaluations
were
based
on
centrally
confirmed
cases
of
Covid-19
.
Owing
to
the
high
incidence
of
Covid-19
and
the
time
taken
for
central
confirmation
,
not
all
cases
had
been
centrally
confirmed
at
the
time
of
the
primary
analysis
.
A
supplementary
analysis
of
RT-PCR–positive
cases
from
all
sources
,
whether
centrally
confirmed
or
not
,
was
therefore
performed
for
subgroups
,
hospitalizations
,
and
deaths.Serious
adverse
events
and
adverse
events
leading
to
withdrawal
from
the
trial
are
being
recorded
throughout
the
trial
.
In
a
safety
subpopulation
comprising
approximately
6000
participants
(
see
below
)
,
data
on
solicited
local
and
systemic
adverse
events
were
recorded
in
an
electronic
diary
for
7
days
after
administration
and
unsolicited
adverse
events
for
28
days
after
administration.The
two
primary
end
points
were
the
efficacy
of
the
Ad26.COV2.S
vaccine
against
the
first
occurrence
of
centrally
confirmed
moderate
to
severe–critical
Covid-19
with
an
onset
at
least
14
days
after
administration
and
at
least
28
days
after
administration
in
the
per-protocol
population
(
see
below
)
.
All
the
potential
cases
of
severe–critical
Covid-19
and
cases
of
moderate
Covid-19
with
at
least
three
signs
or
symptoms
were
classified
as
being
severe–critical
by
an
independent
Clinical
Severity
Adjudication
Committee
whose
members
were
unaware
of
the
group
assignments
.
This
committee
adjudicated
cases
on
the
basis
of
clinical
judgment
(
e.g.
,
a
single
low
oxygen-saturation
measurement
was
not
classified
as
indicating
severe
Covid-19
unless
other
clinical
findings
were
consistent
with
a
severe
classification
)
.
The
case
definitions
for
Covid-19
and
the
protocol-defined
secondary
and
exploratory
end
points
are
described
in
the
Supplementary
Appendix.The
full
analysis
set
included
all
the
participants
who
underwent
randomization
and
received
a
dose
of
trial
vaccine
or
placebo
.
The
per-protocol
population
comprised
participants
who
received
a
dose
of
trial
vaccine
or
placebo
,
were
seronegative
or
had
an
unknown
serostatus
at
the
time
that
the
vaccine
or
placebo
was
administered
,
and
had
no
protocol
deviations
that
were
likely
to
affect
vaccine
efficacy
.
Participants
who
were
RT-PCR–positive
between
days
1
and
14
or
between
days
1
and
28
were
excluded
from
the
analysis
of
cases
with
an
onset
at
least
14
days
after
administration
and
at
least
28
days
after
administration
,
respectively
.
The
per-protocol
population
was
the
main
population
for
the
efficacy
analyses
.
Safety
analyses
were
conducted
in
the
full
analysis
set
,
including
the
safety
subpopulation.The
null
hypothesis
was
that
the
efficacy
of
Ad26.COV2.S
would
be
no
higher
than
30
%
for
each
primary
end
point
,
as
evaluated
with
a
truncated
sequential
probability
ratio
test15,16
at
a
one-sided
significance
level
of
0.025
.
The
sample
size
was
reduced
from
60,000
to
approximately
40,000
on
the
basis
of
the
high
incidence
of
Covid-19
during
the
trial
.
The
primary
analysis
was
triggered
on
a
positive
recommendation
from
the
data
and
safety
monitoring
board
,
after
the
FDA-specified
median
8-week
follow-up
was
reached
and
prespecified
data
requirements
were
met.If
the
null
hypothesis
was
rejected
for
both
primary
end
points
,
secondary
objectives
were
evaluated
against
a
null
hypothesis
that
used
a
lower
limit
of
vaccine
efficacy
of
more
than
0
%
with
prespecified
multiplicity
adjustments
for
familywise
type
I
error
control
(
Fig

)
.
Exact
Poisson
regression17
was
used
for
the
analysis
of
vaccine
efficacy
and
the
associated
confidence
interval
calculations
,
with
accounting
for
follow-up
time
.
The
cumulative
incidence
over
time
was
estimated
with
the
use
of
Kaplan–Meier
methods
to
evaluate
the
onset
of
vaccine
efficacy
and
vaccine
efficacy
over
time
.
Participants
had
their
data
censored
at
the
end
of
their
follow-up.The
frequency
of
serious
adverse
events
was
tabulated
in
the
full
analysis
set
.
The
frequency
and
severity
of
solicited
and
unsolicited
adverse
events
were
tabulated
in
the
safety
subpopulation.The
trial
began
enrollment
on
September
21
,
2020
,
and
the
data-cutoff
date
for
the
present
analysis
was
January
22
,
2021
.
A
total
of
44,325
participants
underwent
randomization
,
of
whom
43,783
received
vaccine
or
placebo
;
the
per-protocol
population
included
39,321
SARS-CoV-2–negative
participants
,
of
whom
19,630
received
Ad26.COV2.S
and
19,691
received
placebo
(
Fig
.
S3
)
.
The
demographic
characteristics
and
coexisting
conditions
of
the
participants
at
baseline
were
balanced
across
the
two
groups
(
Table
1
and
S4
)
.
A
total
of
9.6
%
of
the
participants
were
SARS-CoV-2–seropositive
at
baseline
.
The
median
follow-up
was
58
days
(
range
,
1
to
124
)
,
and
55
%
of
participants
had
at
least
8
weeks
of
follow-up
;
later
and
slower
recruitment
of
participants
60
years
of
age
or
older
with
coexisting
conditions
resulted
in
a
shorter
duration
of
follow-up
in
this
subgroup
(
Table
S5
)
.The
safety
subpopulation
included
3356
participants
in
the
vaccine
group
and
3380
in
the
placebo
group
.
During
the
7-day
period
after
the
administration
of
vaccine
or
placebo
,
more
solicited
adverse
events
were
reported
by
Ad26.COV2.S
recipients
than
by
placebo
recipients
and
by
participants
18
to
59
years
of
age
than
by
those
60
years
of
age
or
older
(
Figure
1
)
.
In
the
vaccine
group
,
injection-site
pain
was
the
most
common
local
reaction
(
in
48.6
%
of
the
participants
)
;
the
most
common
systemic
reactions
were
headache
(
in
38.9
%
)
,
fatigue
(
in
38.2
%
)
,
myalgia
(
in
33.2
%
)
,
and
nausea
(
in
14.2
%
)
.The
adverse
events
of
at
least
grade
3
that
were
considered
by
the
investigators
to
be
possibly
related
to
Ad26.COV2.S
or
placebo
are
listed
in
Table
S6
.
Serious
adverse
events
,
excluding
those
related
to
Covid-19
,
were
reported
by
83
of
21,895
vaccine
recipients
(
0.4
%
)
and
by
96
of
21,888
placebo
recipients
(
0.4
%
)
.
Seven
serious
adverse
events
were
considered
by
the
investigators
to
be
related
to
vaccination
in
the
Ad26.COV2.S
group
(
Table
S7
)
.A
numeric
imbalance
was
observed
for
venous
thromboembolic
events
(
11
in
the
vaccine
group
vs.
3
in
the
placebo
group
)
.
Most
of
these
participants
had
underlying
medical
conditions
and
predisposing
factors
that
might
have
contributed
to
these
events
(
Table
S8
)
.
Imbalances
were
also
observed
with
regard
to
seizure
(
which
occurred
in
4
participants
in
the
vaccine
group
vs.
1
in
the
placebo
group
)
and
tinnitus
(
in
6
vs.
0
)
.
A
causal
relationship
between
these
events
and
Ad26.COV2.S
can
not
be
determined
.
These
events
will
be
monitored
in
the
post-marketing
setting.Three
deaths
were
reported
in
the
vaccine
group
and
16
in
the
placebo
group
,
all
of
which
were
considered
by
the
investigators
to
be
unrelated
to
the
trial
intervention
(
Table
S7
)
.
No
deaths
related
to
Covid-19
were
reported
in
the
vaccine
group
,
whereas
5
deaths
related
to
Covid-19
were
reported
in
the
placebo
group
.
Transverse
sinus
thrombosis
with
cerebral
hemorrhage
and
a
case
of
the
Guillain–Barré
syndrome
were
each
seen
in
1
vaccine
recipient.In
the
per-protocol
at-risk
population
,
468
centrally
confirmed
cases
of
symptomatic
Covid-19
with
an
onset
at
least
14
days
after
administration
were
observed
,
of
which
464
were
moderate
to
severe–critical
(
116
cases
in
the
vaccine
group
vs.
348
in
the
placebo
group
)
,
which
indicated
vaccine
efficacy
of
66.9
%
(
adjusted
95
%
confidence
interval
[
CI
]
,
59.0
to
73.4
)
(
Table
2
)
.
In
terms
of
the
primary
end
point
of
disease
onset
at
least
28
days
after
administration
,
66
cases
of
moderate
to
severe–critical
Covid-19
in
the
vaccine
group
and
193
cases
in
the
placebo
group
were
observed
,
which
indicated
vaccine
efficacy
of
66.1
%
(
adjusted
95
%
CI
,
55.0
to
74.8
)
(
Table
2
)
.The
cumulative
incidence
of
the
first
occurrence
of
moderate
to
severe–critical
Covid-19
diverged
between
the
two
trial
groups
at
approximately
14
days
after
the
administration
of
vaccine
or
placebo
,
which
indicates
an
early
onset
of
protection
with
the
vaccine
(
Figure
2A
)
.
Fewer
cases
in
the
vaccine
group
were
observed
after
day
14
while
cases
continued
to
accrue
in
the
placebo
group
,
which
led
to
increasing
vaccine
efficacy
over
time
(
Fig
.
S4A
)
.
Efficacy
against
disease
with
an
onset
at
least
28
days
after
administration
was
similar
across
age
groups
,
but
efficacy
against
disease
with
an
onset
14
days
after
administration
was
higher
among
older
participants
than
among
younger
participants
(
Table
2
)
.
This
discrepancy
probably
resulted
from
differences
in
follow-up
duration
or
from
smaller
sample
sizes
in
subgroups
.
The
number
of
primary
end-point
cases
was
similar
to
the
number
of
cases
of
symptomatic
Covid-19
as
defined
according
to
the
FDA
harmonized
definition
(
Table
2
)
;
thus
,
the
primary
end-point
analyses
captured
most
of
the
cases
of
symptomatic
Covid-19
.

vaccine
efficacy
in
the
analyses
of
the
two
primary
end
points
and
the
secondary
end
points
of
centrally
confirmed
cases
differed
by
less
than
2
percentage
points
from
the
estimates
in
analyses
of
positive
cases
from
all
sources
,
and
the
confidence
intervals
were
similar
(
Table
2
and
Table
3
)
.
Vaccine-efficacy
estimates
in
the
full
analysis
set
were
generally
lower
than
those
in
the
per-protocol
population
because
the
estimates
included
cases
that
occurred
at
or
after
1
day
after
administration
,
when
immunity
was
building
(
Table
S9
)
.With
regard
to
severe–critical
Covid-19
,
vaccine
efficacy
was
76.7
%
(
adjusted
95
%
CI
,
54.6
to
89.1
)
against
disease
with
onset
at
least
14
days
after
administration
and
85.4
%
(
adjusted
95
%
CI
,
54.2
to
96.9
)
against
disease
with
onset
at
least
28
days
after
administration
(
Table
2
)
.
The
cumulative-incidence
curves
began
to
separate
approximately
7
days
after
administration
;
vaccine
efficacy
increased
with
longer
follow-up
and
was
92.4
%
after
day
42
(
post
hoc
calculation
)
(
Figures
2B
and
S4B
)
.The
analysis
of
vaccine
efficacy
against
asymptomatic
infection
included
all
the
participants
with
a
newly
positive
N-immunoassay
result
at
day
71
(
i.e.
,
those
who
had
been
seronegative
or
had
no
result
available
at
day
29
and
who
were
seropositive
at
day
71
)
.
Only
2650
participants
had
an
N-immunoassay
result
available
at
day
71
,
and
therefore
only
a
preliminary
analysis
could
be
performed
.
A
total
of
18
asymptomatic
infections
were
identified
in
the
vaccine
group
and
50
in
the
placebo
group
(
vaccine
efficacy
,
65.5
%
;
95
%
CI
,
39.9
to
81.1
)
.Vaccine
efficacy
against
Covid-19
involving
medical
intervention
ranged
from
75.0
to
100.0
%
(
Table
S10
)
.
Two
cases
of
Covid-19
with
onset
at
least
14
days
after
administration
in
the
Ad26.COV2.S
group
and
29
such
cases
in
the

led
to
hospitalization
(

;
95

No

The

was
24
%
(

lower
among
vaccine

.The
estimates
of
vaccine
efficacy
against
severe–critical
disease
were
consistently
high
across
countries
that
had
sufficient
cases
for
analysis
(
Table

)
.
On
the
basis
of
interim
sequencing
data
from
512
unique
RT-PCR–positive
samples
obtained
from
714
participants
(
71.7
%
)
with
SARS-CoV-2
infection
,
the
reference
sequence
(
Wuhan-Hu-1
including
the
D614G
mutation
)
was
detected
predominantly
in
the
United
States
(
190
of
197
sequences
[
96.4
%
]
)
and
the
20H/501Y.V2
variant
(
also
called
B.1.351
)
was
detected
predominantly
in
South
Africa
(
86
of
91
sequences
[
94.5
%
]
)
,
whereas
in
Brazil
,
the
reference
sequence
was
detected
in
38
of
124
sequences
(
30.6
%
)
and
the
reference
sequence
with
the
E484K
mutation
(
P.2
lineage
)
was
detected
in
86
of
124
sequences
(
69.4
%
)
.
Despite
the
high
prevalence
of
the
20H/501Y.V2
variant
in
South
Africa
and
in
Covid-19
cases
in
the
trial
,
vaccine
efficacy
was
maintained
(
52.0
%
against
moderate
to
severe–critical
disease
and
73.1
%
against
severe–critical
disease
with
onset
≥14
days
after
administration
;
64.0
%
against
moderate
to
severe–critical
disease
and
81.7
%
against
severe–critical
disease
with
onset
at
≥28
days
after
administration
)
(
Figure
2C
and
Table

)
.
In
South
Africa
,
no
hospitalizations
of
participants
with
an
onset
of
Covid-19
at
least
28
days
after
administration
occurred
in
the
vaccine
group
,
as
compared
with
6
hospitalizations
in
the
placebo
group
.
All
five
Covid-19–related
deaths
in
the
trial
occurred
in
the
placebo
group
in
South
Africa.No
meaningful
differences
in
vaccine
efficacy
were
observed
among
subgroups
defined
according
to
sex
,
race
,
or
ethnic
group
(
Fig
.
S7
and
Table
S11
)
.
A
lower
point
estimate
of
vaccine
efficacy
was
observed
among
participants
60
years
of
age
or
older
with
coexisting
conditions
in
the
analysis
of
cases
with
onset
at
least
28
days
after
administration
(
15
cases
of
moderate
to
severe–critical
Covid-19
among
vaccine
recipients
vs.
26
cases
among
placebo
recipients
)
but
not
in
the
analysis
of
cases
with
onset
at
least
14
days
after
administration
(
22
vs.
63
cases
)
(
Fig
.
S7
)
.
Estimates
of
efficacy
over
time
that
were
based
on
Kaplan–Meier
analysis
were
similar
among
participants
60
years
of
age
or
older
with
coexisting
conditions
and
those
without
coexisting
conditions
(
Figs
.
S4C
and
S8
)
.
Two
participants
60
years
of
age
or
older
with
coexisting
conditions
in
the
vaccine
group
were
hospitalized
,
as
compared
with
11
such
participants
in
the
placebo
group
(
vaccine
efficacy
,
81.6
%
;
95
%
CI
,
15.8
to
98.0
)
.This
international
,
phase
3
ENSEMBLE
trial
showed
the
efficacy
of
a
single
dose
of
the
Ad26.COV2.S
vaccine
in
preventing
Covid-19
.
Efficacy
against
moderate
to
severe–critical
Covid-19
was
67
%
against
disease
with
onset
at
least
14
days
after
administration
and
66
%
against
disease
with
onset
28
days
after
administration
.
Because
the
number
of
primary
end-point
cases
was
similar
to
the
number
of
cases
according
to
the
FDA
harmonized
definition
,
this
estimate
essentially
captures
most
of
the
cases
of
symptomatic
Covid-19
.
Higher
efficacy
against
severe–critical
Covid-19
was
observed
,
with
vaccine
efficacy
of
77
%
against
disease
with
onset
at
least
14
days
after
administration
and
85
%
against
disease
with
onset
at
least
28
days
after
administration.The
onset
of
efficacy
was
evident
as
of
14
days
after
administration
for
moderate
to
severe–critical
disease
and
as
of
7
days
after
administration
for
severe–critical
disease
.
Efficacy
continued
to
increase
through
approximately
8
weeks
after
administration
,
especially
for
severe–critical
Covid-19
.
No
evidence
of
waning
efficacy
was
noted
among
the
approximately
3000
participants
who
were
followed
for
11
weeks
or
among
1000
participants
who
were
followed
for
15
weeks
,
a
finding
that
is
consistent
with
the
persistence
of
humoral
immunity
that
was
observed
in
a
phase
1–2a
trial.9Efficacy
against
severe–critical
Covid-19
was
consistently
high
overall
and
in
individual
countries
that
had
sufficient
cases
for
analysis
,
which
is
particularly
important
because
severe
disease
has
the
greatest
effect
on
individual
persons
and
health
care
systems.19
Efficacy
against
Covid-19
involving
hospitalization
was
93
%
with
regard
to
onset
at
least
14
days
after
administration
(
2
cases
in
the
vaccine
group
and
29
in
the
placebo
group
)
and
100
%
with
regard
to
onset
at
least
28
days
after
administration
(
no
hospitalizations
in
the
vaccine
group
and
16
in
the
placebo
group
)
.
Although
hospitalization
can
be
influenced
by
local
practice
and
resource
availability
,
all
the
hospitalizations
that
were
reported
were
justified
by
clear
clinical
findings
and
were
consistent
across
countries
.
Moreover
,
identical
management
practices
would
have
applied
to
the
Ad26.COV2.S
group
and
the
placebo
group
in
each
country
.
Five
deaths
that
were
related
to
Covid-19
occurred
in
the
placebo
group
,
but
there
were
no
such
deaths
in
the
vaccine
group
.
The
reduction
in
the
incidence
of
death
and
the
high
efficacy
against
hospitalization
are
expected
to
substantially
reduce
the
effect
of
this
disease
on
individual
persons
and
dramatically
decrease
the
burden
on
health
care
systems.Vaccine
recipients
with
breakthrough
Covid-19
reported
fewer
and
less
severe
symptoms
than
did
placebo
recipients
with
Covid-19
,
which
suggests
that
illness
is
milder
after
vaccination
.
The
data
are
consistent
with
studies
reporting
higher
efficacy
of
the
influenza
vaccine
against
more
severe
influenza20-22
and
the
attenuation
of
influenza
among
vaccinees.23-25
A
preliminary
analysis
indicated
that
Ad26.COV2.S
provided
at
least
66
%
protection
against
serologically
confirmed
asymptomatic
infection
with
SARS-CoV-2
.
The
effect
on
the
incidence
of
symptomatic
and
asymptomatic
SARS-CoV-2
infection
by
the
vaccine
suggests
that
it
might
be
useful
in
reducing
community-wide
transmission.New
SARS-CoV-2
virus
lineages
have
emerged
,
with
mutations
in
the
N-terminal
and
receptor-binding
domains
of
the
spike
protein
that
are
known
targets
for
neutralizing
antibodies
;
in
particular
,
the
E484K
mutation
is
associated
with
reduced
neutralization
sensitivity.26-31
Of
main
concern
are
variants
that
were
first
identified
in
Brazil
,
South
Africa
,
and
the
United
Kingdom.2-4
In
our
trial
,
95
%
of
the
Covid-19
cases
in
South
Africa
in
which
SARS-CoV-2
was
sequenced
were
caused
by
the
20H/501Y.V2
variant
,
whereas
a
variant
from
the
P.2
lineage
carrying
the
E484K
mutation
was
identified
in
69
%
of
the
cases
in
Brazil
with
a
sequenced
sample
.
However
,
despite
the
high
prevalence
of
SARS-CoV-2
variants
of
concern
,
vaccine
efficacy
remained
high
.
This
finding
shows
that
a
Covid-19
vaccine
that
was
based
on
the
original
Wuhan-Hu-1
strain
can
elicit
cross-protective
efficacy
against
new
variants
in
South
Africa
and
Brazil
.
Nonneutralizing
antibodies
against
SARS-CoV-2
variants
are
probably
preserved
because
they
are
not
limited
to
the
N-terminal
or
receptor-binding
domains
,
where
most
mutations
occur
.
Antibodies
with
Fc-mediated
functions
are
induced
by
Ad26.COV2.S
against
SARS-CoV-2
in
humans,32
and
these
Fc
functional
antibodies
show
no
decrease
in
potency
against
new
variants
(
personal
communication
:
G.
Alter
and
D.
Barouch
)
.
In
addition
,
CD8+
T-cell
responses
to
the
SARS-CoV-2
spike
protein
were
seen
in
a
phase
1–2a
trial.9
T-cell
epitopes
were
shown
to
be
conserved
between
SARS-CoV-2
variants
according
to
immunoinformatics
analyses.33-35
These
factors
might
contribute
to
the
high
efficacy
against
severe–critical
disease
,
hospitalization
,
and
death
in
South
Africa
,
where
the
relatively
neutralization-resistant
20H/501Y.V2
variant
predominates.26,36Efficacy
against
symptomatic
infection
was
similar
among
younger
and
older
participants
and
among
participants
with
coexisting
conditions
and
those
without
coexisting
conditions
.
A
subgroup
analysis
involving
participants
60
years
of
age
or
older
showed
that
vaccine
efficacy
against
symptomatic
disease
with
onset
at
least
14
days
after
administration
was
similar
in
subgroups
defined
according
to
the
presence
or
absence
of
coexisting
conditions
.
With
regard
to
onset
at
least
28
days
after
administration
,
vaccine
efficacy
appeared
lower
among
participants
with
coexisting
conditions
than
among
those
without
coexisting
conditions
.
This
finding
can
be
attributed
to
imprecision
owing
to
fewer
cases
and
shorter
follow-up
in
this
subgroup
.
Furthermore
,
Kaplan–Meier
curves
indicated
that
the
cumulative
incidence
of
cases
among
vaccine
recipients
60
years
of
age
or
older
with
coexisting
conditions
was
similar
to
that
in
the
overall
trial
population
,
which
suggests
a
similar
vaccine
efficacy
.
Vaccine
efficacy
against
hospitalization
among
vaccine
recipients
60
years
of
age
or
older
with
coexisting
conditions
was
82
%
,
a
finding
consistent
with
this
result.This
trial
confirmed
the
findings
from
a
phase
1–2a
trial9
showing
that
Ad26.COV2.S
had
an
acceptable
safety
and
reactogenicity
profile
.
Reactogenicity
to
Ad26.COV2.S
was
transient
,
was
lower
in
older
participants
than
in
younger
participants
,
and
resolved
quickly
.
Severe
reactogenicity
(
grade
≥3
)
was
uncommon
,
and
serious
adverse
events
were
rare
.
Data
from
the
current
trial
are
supported
by
long-term
and
robust
safety
data
on
the
Ad26
platform.10-12A
key
strength
of
this
trial
is
that
it
showed
vaccine
efficacy
in
an
ethnically
and
geographically
diverse
population
,
including
participants
in
regions
with
emerging
SARS-CoV-2
variants
,
as
well
as
in
participants
with
coexisting
conditions
that
have
been
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
severe
Covid-19
.
A
limitation
of
the
trial
is
the
relatively
short
follow-up
,
which
was
necessitated
,
as
in
other
Covid-19
vaccine
trials
,
by
the
urgent
need
for
vaccine
.
The
data
do
not
suggest
a
waning
of
protection
.
Long-term
unblinded
follow-up
is
planned
to
compare
results
in
initial
Ad26.COV2.S
recipients
with
those
in
placebo
recipients
who
are
expected
to
receive
Ad26.COV2.S
after
a
protocol
amendment
has
been
approved.This
trial
was
conducted
during
a
time
of
an
extraordinarily
high
incidence
of
SARS-CoV-2
infection
.
Lower
vaccine
efficacy
has
been
associated
with
a
higher
incidence
of
disease.37-39
This
situation
,
combined
with
the
emergence
of
viral
variants
,
precludes
the
comparison
of
vaccine
trials
.
In
this
trial
,
we
robustly
field-tested
a
simple
regimen
under
high
attack-rate
conditions
on
three
continents
and
consistently
found
early
and
increasing
protection
from
severe
disease.In
this
trial
,
we
found
that
a
single
dose
of
Ad26.COV2.S
protected
against
symptomatic
Covid-19
and
was
particularly
efficacious
against
severe–critical
disease
(
including
hospitalization
and
death
)
,
including
in
countries
where
variants
that
are
considered
to
be
relatively
resistant
to
antibody
neutralization
predominate
.
Safety
appeared
to
be
similar
to
that
seen
in
previous
phase
3
trials
of
Covid-19
vaccines
.
The
single-dose
schedule
and
favorable
storage
conditions
of
this
vaccine
provide
major
advantages
in
its
deployment
and
effect
worldwide
.
Vaccination
against
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
2
(
SARS-CoV-2
)
prevents
infection
and
reduces
the
severity
of
coronavirus
disease
2019
(
Covid-19
)
in
vaccinated
persons.1,2
We
investigated
whether
vaccination
would
reduce
transmission
in
the
household
setting
in
the
context
of
postvaccination
infection.We
analyzed
data
from
the
Household
Transmission
Evaluation
Dataset
(
HOSTED
)
,
which
has
information
on
all
laboratory-confirmed
cases
of
Covid-19
in
England
and
in
which
data
on
all
persons
sharing
the
same
address
are
linked.3
We
then
linked
to
individual-level
data
on
all
Covid-19
vaccinations
in
England
(
see
the
Methods
section
in
the
Supplementary
Appendix
,
available
with
the
full
text
of
this
letter
at
NEJM.org
)
.We
compared
the
risk
of
secondary
infection
(
defined
as
a
positive
SARS-CoV-2
test
2
to
14
days
after
the
positive
test

,
2021
,
there
were
960,765
household
contacts
of
unvaccinated

patients
,
and
there
were
96,898
secondary
cases
of
Covid-19
(
10.1
%
)
.

The
numbers
of
secondary
cases
according

the
vaccination
status
of
the
index
patient
,
and
the
results
of
logistic-regression
models
,
are
shown
in
Table

.
Overall
,
the
likelihood
of
household
transmission
was
approximately
40
to
50
%
lower
in
households
of
index
patients
who
had
been
vaccinated
21
days
or
more
before
testing
positive
than
in
households
of
unvaccinated
index
patients
;
the
findings
were
similar
for
the
two
vaccines
.
Most
of
the
vaccinated
index
patients
in
our
data
set
(
93
%
)
had
received
only
the
first
dose
of
vaccine
.
Assessment
of
infection
risks
among
household
contacts
according
to
the
timing
of
vaccination
of
the
index
patient
showed
protective
effects
when
the
vaccine
had
been
administered
at
least
14
days
before
the
positive
test
(
Figs
.
S1
and
S2
in
the
Supplementary
Appendix
)
.HOSTED
does
not
include
data
on
symptoms
or
cycle-threshold
values
and
has
information
only
on
diagnosed
cases
.
Among
index
patients
,
those
who
had
been
vaccinated
were
likely
to
be
less
severely
symptomatic2
and
might
have
been
less
infectious
than
those
who
were
unvaccinated.4
Studies
that
involved
active
follow-up
of
contacts
and
that
used
serologic
testing
have
shown
higher
rates
of
household
transmission
than
were
observed
in
our
study5
;
bias
could
occur
if
case
ascertainment
differed
between
household
contacts
of
vaccinated
persons
and
those
of
unvaccinated
persons
.
Our
findings
with
respect
to
the
timing
of
vaccination
of
index
patients
are
consistent
with
previous
data
regarding
the
timing
of
individual
protection
after
vaccination1
and
thus
support
the
overall
findings
.
There
may
have
been
misclassification
of
index
and
secondary
cases
,
which
are
determined
on
the
basis
of
testing
dates
;
however
,
such
misclassification
would
tend
to
attenuate
the
estimated
protective
effect
of
vaccination
.
Data
are
needed
to
inform
the
reduction
in
transmissibility
of
the
virus
after
the
receipt
of
two
vaccine
doses
.
It
will
be
important
to
consider
these
findings
alongside
other
emerging
evidence
to
inform
the
benefits
of
vaccination.Ross

.
In
this

,
data
from
Israel
’

largest
health

organization
were
used
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
the
BNT162b2

vaccine.All
persons
who
were
newly
vaccinated
during
the
period
from
December
20
,
2020
,
to
February
1
,
2021
,
were
matched
to
unvaccinated

Estimated

,
with
potentially
slightly
lower

in
persons
with
multiple
coexisting
conditions.This
study
in
a
nationwide
mass
vaccination
setting
suggests
that
the
BNT162b2
mRNA
vaccine
is
effective
for
a
wide
range
of
Covid-19–related
outcomes
,
a
finding
consistent
with
that
of
the
randomized

severe

are
beginning
in
many
parts
of
the
world
.
Randomized
clinical
trials
of
mRNA-based
vaccines
reported
efficacies
for
preventing
coronavirus
2019
(
Covid-19
)
in
the
range
of
94
%
2
to
95
%
.1Although
randomized
clinical
trials
are
considered
the
“
gold
standard
”
for
evaluating
intervention
effects
,
they
have
notable
limitations
of
sample
size
and
subgroup
analysis
,
restrictive
inclusion
criteria
,
and
a
highly
controlled
setting
that
may
not
be
replicated
in
a
mass
vaccine
rollout
.
For
example
,
the
phase
3
trial
of
the
BNT162b2
mRNA
vaccine
against
Covid-19
included
21,720
persons
who
were
randomly
assigned
to
the
vaccinated
group
,
which
permitted
estimates
of
vaccine
efficacy
in
only
a
small
number
of
subpopulations.1
Moreover
,
patients
with
chronic
diseases
were
included
only
if
the
conditions
were
deemed
stable
by
the
investigators.3
It
is
also
important
to
see
whether
in
a
scaled-up
vaccination
program
such
factors
as
suboptimal
adherence
to
vaccination
schedules
and
vaccine-handling
logistics
influence
vaccine
effectiveness
.
Postauthorization
analyses
can
thus
meet
the
urgent
need
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
Covid-19
vaccines
across
diverse
populations
with
a
wide
range
of
coexisting
conditions
,
in
the
midst
of
imperfect
adherence
to
vaccination
protocols
and
the
challenges
of
cold-chain
maintenance
and
vaccine-deployment
logistics.We
leveraged
the
integrated
data
repositories
of
Israel
’
s
largest
health
care
organization
to
evaluate
Covid-19
vaccine
effectiveness
for
five
outcomes
:
documented
SARS-CoV-2
infection
,
symptomatic
Covid-19
,
hospitalization
,
severe
illness
,
and
death
.
Using
this
observational
data
set
,
we
evaluated
the
effectiveness
over
time
and
in
subpopulations
defined
by
age
,
sex
,
and
coexisting
conditions.We
analyzed
data
from
Clalit
Health
Services
(
CHS
)
,
the
largest
of
four
integrated
health

organizations
in
Israel
,
which
insures
4.7
million

was
exempt
from

designed
this
observational
study
to
emulate
a
target
trial
of
the
causal
effect
of
the
BNT162b2
vaccine
on
Covid-19
outcomes.4
Eligibility
criteria
included
an
age
of
16
years
or
older
,
not
having
a
previously
documented
positive
SARS-CoV-2
polymerase-chain-reaction
(
PCR
)
test
,
and
being
a
member
of
the
health
care
organization
during
the
previous
12
months.Population
groups
in
which
internal
variability
in
the
probability
of
exposure
or
the
outcomes
is
high
and
controlling
for
the
high
variability
is
not
feasible
(
e.g.
,
high
variability
in
infection
risk
among
patient-facing
health
care
workers
in
dedicated
Covid-19
wards
as
compared
with
administrative
staff
)
were
excluded
.
Such
population
groups
are
persons
not
having
a
documented
geostatistical
living
area
,
those
who
have
had
interactions
with
the
health
care
system
during
the
preceding
3
days
that
may
indicate
the
start
of

disease
and
may
preclude
vaccination
,
nursing
home
residents
,
persons
medically
confined

workers.Each
day
during
the
period
from
December
20
,
2020
,
to
February
1
,
2021
,
all
newly
vaccinated
persons
were
matched
in
a
1:1
ratio
to
unvaccinated

.
For
each
person
,
follow-up
ended
at
the
earliest
of
the
following
events
:
occurrence
of
an
outcome
event
,
death
unrelated
to
Covid-19
,
vaccination
(
for
unvaccinated

)
,
vaccination
of
the
matched
control
(
for
vaccinated
persons
)
,
or
the
end
of
the
study
period
.
Newly
vaccinated
persons
were
eligible
for
inclusion
in
the
study
,
even
if
they
had
previously
been
selected
as
a
control.We
matched
vaccine
recipients
and
controls
on
variables
associated
with
the
probability
of
both
vaccination
and
infection
or
severity
of
Covid-19
:
age
,

and
associated
with
the
rate
of

)
,
and
the
total
number
of
coexisting

that
had
been
identified
by
the
Centers

The
five
outcomes

,
documented

and
death
from
Covid-19
.
Each
of
these
outcomes
includes
the
outcomes
that
follow
it
.
In
a
supplementary
analysis
,
we
also
evaluated
an
additional
outcome
,
SARS-CoV-2
infection
without
documented
symptoms
,
as
an
imperfect
proxy
for
asymptomatic
infection
(
since
mild
symptoms
may
not
be
documented
)
.Table

provides
details
on
definitions
of
variables
.
Persons
with
missing
data
for
smoking
status
or
body-mass
index
(
BMI
)
were
dropped
from
the
analysis.Covariate
balance
after
matching
was
evaluated
with
the
use
of
a
plot
of
the
mean
differences
between
variable
values
(
standardized
for
continuous
variables
)
for
the
vaccinated
and
unvaccinated
groups
,
with
a
difference
of
0.1
or
less
considered
to
be
acceptable.9
Survival
curves
for
the
vaccinated
and
unvaccinated
groups
were
estimated
with
the
Kaplan–Meier
estimator.10
We
considered
three
periods
:
days
14
through
20
after
the
first
dose
of
vaccine
,
days
21
through
27
after
the
first
dose
(
administration
of
the
second
dose
was
scheduled
to
occur
on
day
21
after
the
first
dose
)
,
and
day
7
after
the
second
dose
until
the
end
of
the
follow-up
.
For
each
period
,
we
used
the
Kaplan–Meier
estimator
with
daily
outcome
and
censoring
events
to
compute
the
probability
(
“
risk
”
)
of
the
outcome
during
the
period
,
using
matched
pairs
in
which
both
persons
were
still
at
risk
at
the
beginning
of
the
period
.
We
then
calculated
risk
ratios
for
vaccination
as
compared
with
no
vaccination
and
estimated
the
vaccine
effectiveness
as
one
minus
the
risk
ratio
.
We
estimated
the
vaccine
effectiveness
only
in
analyses
in
which
there
were
more
than
10
instances
of
an
outcome
across
the
two
groups.The
period
immediately
after
the
first
dose
,
when
immunity
is
gradually
building,1
was
excluded
in
the
main
analyses
because
the
risk
ratio
is
expected
to
be
close
to
1
during
this
period
.
In
secondary
analyses
,
we
considered
the
periods
from
day
0
through
day
20
and
day
0
through
day
27
,
to
avoid
a
potential
selection
bias
in
the
main
analyses
that
were
restricted
to
persons
whose
data
remained
uncensored
at
the
beginning
of
each
period
(
see
Supplementary
Methods
4
)
.11-13
We
also
conducted
a
sensitivity
analysis
in
the
6
days
after
the
second
dose
of
vaccine
among
those
who
received
a
second
dose
.
A
further
sensitivity
analysis
estimated
the
hazard
ratio
each
day
for
the
documented
SARS-CoV-2
infection
outcome.We
performed
an
additional
sensitivity
analysis
to
assess
the
potential
for
selection
bias
due
to
informative
censoring
.
In
this
analysis
,
data
on
controls
who
were
subsequently
vaccinated
were
censored
only
after
7
days
(
i.e.
,
after
the
period
with
little
or
no
vaccine
effect
)
plus
the
median
time
from
documented
Covid-19
diagnosis
to
the
outcome
being
studied.We
calculated
95
%
confidence
intervals
using
the
percentile
bootstrap
method
with
500
repetitions
.
Analyses
were
performed
with
the
use

4.0.2.Of
1,503,216
CHS
members
who
were
vaccinated
,
1,163,534
were
eligible
for
the
study
and
596,618
were
matched
to
unvaccinated
controls
(
Figure
1
)
.
Matched
persons
were
younger
than
the
eligible
population
overall
and
had
a
lower
prevalence
of
chronic
conditions
because
there
was
a
smaller
pool
of
potential
unvaccinated
matches
for
older
vaccine
recipients
,
owing
to
high
vaccination
rates
in
the
older
population
(

)
.
The
baseline
characteristics
of
the

the
effectiveness
of
the
novel
BNT162b2
mRNA
vaccine1
against

in
a

setting

Estimated
vaccine

was

for

for

,
87

for

,
and
92
%
for

.
Estimated
effectiveness
during
days
14
through

(
after
one
dose
)
and
days
21
through
27
(
gradual
shifting
between
the
first

)
was
46
%
and
60
%
for

,
57
%
and
66
%
for

Covid-19
,

80
%
for

Covid-19
,
and
72
%
and
84
%
for
Covid-19–related
death
,
respectively.The
first
primary
end
point
evaluated
in
the
randomized
trial
of
the
BNT162b2
vaccine
was
symptomatic
Covid-19
.
In
both
the
randomized
trial
and
our
study
,
the
cumulative
incidence
of
symptomatic
Covid-19
in
the
vaccinated
and
unvaccinated
groups
began
to
diverge
around
day
12
after
the
first
dose.1
The
estimated
vaccine
efficacy
for
symptomatic
Covid-19
starting
at
day
7
after
the
second
dose
was
95
%
in
the
randomized
trial
,
as
compared
with
94
%
in
our
study
.
The
estimated
efficacy
between
the
first
dose
and
the
second
dose
was
52
%
in
the
trial
,
as
compared
with
29
%
in
our
study
.
This
difference
may
reflect
the
high
level
of
transmission
in
Israel
during
the
study
period,14
which
affected
both
the
vaccinated
persons
and
the
controls
equally
during
the
first
12
days
after
administration
of
the
first
dose
.
To
eliminate
this
distortion
,
we
estimated
first-dose
effectiveness
of
the
vaccine
against
Covid-19
for
the
period
from
days
14
through
20
;
the
estimated
effectiveness
was
57
%
.The
estimated
effectiveness
for
documented
infection
during
days
14
through
20
was
46
%
in
our
study
.
A
relatively
similar
effectiveness
of
51
%
was
reported
by
Chodick
et
al.,15
who
evaluated
a
cohort
from
another
health
care
organization
in
Israel
and
used
a
different
study
design
that
compared
infection
among
vaccinated
persons
at
days
13
through
24
after
the
first
dose
against
infection
during
days
0
through
12.In
the
randomized
trial
,
the
estimated
vaccine
efficacy
for
severe
Covid-19
(
89
%
over
the
entire
study
period
)
was
based
on
only
10
cases
.
Our
study
recorded
229
cases
of
severe
Covid-19
—
55
in
the
vaccinated
group
and
174
in
the
unvaccinated
group
—
resulting
in
an
estimated
effectiveness
of
62
%
for
days
14
through
20
after
the
first
dose
,
80
%
for
days
21
through
27
,
and
92
%
for
7
or
more
days
after
the
second
dose.The
large
sample
size
in
our
study
also
allowed
us
to
estimate
vaccine
effectiveness
for
specific
subpopulations
that
the
randomized
trial
was
not
sufficiently
powered
to
evaluate
.
In
the
trial
,
the
estimated
efficacy
for
Covid-19
among
persons
up
to
55
years
of
age
,
older
than
55
years
,
and
65
years
or
older
7
days
after
the
second
dose
was
94
to
96
%
.
We
were
able
to
study
more
granular
age
groups
,
and
we
estimated
that
the
vaccine
effectiveness
was
similar
for
adults
70
years
of
age
or
older
and
for
younger
age
groups
for
the
same
time
period.The
randomized
trial
estimated
vaccine
efficacy
for
patients
with
one
or
more
coexisting
conditions
according
to
the
Charlson
comorbidity
index16
and
specifically
for
patients
with
obesity
or
hypertension
.
These
measures
do
not
provide
clarity
regarding
effectiveness
in
patients
with
multiple
coexisting
conditions
.
We
estimated
vaccine
effectiveness
in
relation
to
various
numbers
of
coexisting
conditions
and
found
indications
that
effectiveness
may
be
slightly
lower
among
persons
with
higher
numbers
of
coexisting
conditions.Two
factors
make
the
present
study
uniquely
suited
to
evaluating
the
effectiveness
of
the
BNT162b2
vaccine
in
a
practical
application
:
first
,
a
rare
combination
of
rich
medical
background
data
,
Covid-19
PCR
test
results
(
for
the
documented
infection
outcome
)
,
and
patient
follow-up
data
in
both
community
(
for
the
symptomatic
Covid-19
outcome
)
and
inpatient
(
for
all
other
outcomes
)
settings
—
CHS
has
maintained
such
an
integrated
data
repository
for
over
half
the
Israeli
population
,
and
has
updated
it
daily
,
for
more
than
two
decades
;
and
second
,
the
rapid
pace
and
high
uptake
of
Covid-19
vaccine
in
Israel
and
the
high
disease
rates
during
the
vaccination
campaign
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
rapid
pace
of
the
vaccination
campaign
contributed
to
the
frequent
censoring
of
data
for
matched
unvaccinated
controls
,
especially
among
those
over
the
age
of
60
years
(
often
only
a
few
days
after
matching
)
and
the
corresponding
reduction
in
the
average
follow-up
period
of
the
study.Concerns
have
emerged
regarding
the
possible
resistance
of
SARS-CoV-2
variants
to
Covid-19
vaccines17,18
and
neutralizing
antibodies.19,20
During
the
study
period
,
an
increasing
share
of
SARS-CoV-2
isolates
in
Israel
—
up
to
80
%
in
the
days
before
data
extraction
—
were
of
the
B.1.1.7
variant.21
Thus
,
this
study
estimates
an
average
effectiveness
of
the
vaccine
over
multiple
strains
.
Although
we
can
not
provide
a
specific
effectiveness
estimate
for
the
B.1.1.7
variant
,
the
plateau
observed
during
the
later
periods
in
the
cumulative
incidence
curve
for
vaccinated
persons
suggests
that
the
BNT162b2
vaccine
is
also
effective
for
this
variant
,
an
observation
consistent
with
previous
reports
that
showed
preserved
neutralizing
antibody
titers.22
The
B.1.351
variant
was
estimated
to
be
rare
in
Israel
at
the
time
of
data
extraction.23As
with
any
observational
study
,
our
study
may
have
been
affected
by
residual
confounding
due
to
differences
between
vaccinated
persons
and
unvaccinated
controls
,
especially
in
terms
of
health-seeking
behavior
.
We
therefore
performed
rigorous
matching
on
a
wide
range
of
factors
that
may
be
expected
to
confound
the
causal
effect
of
the
vaccine
on
the
various
outcomes
.
After
the
matching
process
,
we
found
a
consistent
pattern
of
similarity
between
the
groups
in
the
days
just
before
day
12
after
the
first
dose
(
the
anticipated
onset
of
the
vaccine
effect
)
,
which
thus
serve
as
a
“
negative
control
”
24
period
(
Figure
2
,
Fig
.
S6
,
and
Table
S7
)
.
This
similarity
occurred
despite
a
temporary
increase
in
events
among
unvaccinated
controls
during
the
very
first
days
after
the
first
vaccine
dose
,
most
likely
stemming
from
the
fact
that
persons
who
choose
to
be
vaccinated
on
a
specific
day
are
feeling
well
at
the
time
of
vaccination
.
The
similarity
of
the
study
groups
in
coexisting
conditions
and
known
risk
factors
for
severe
Covid-19
(
Table
1
and
Fig
.
S2
)
provides
further
evidence
of
exchangeability
(
i.e.
,
absence
of
confounding
)
.
However
,
this
rigorous
matching
process
came
at
the
cost
of
not
including
in
the
final
cohort
approximately
34
%
of
the
vaccinated
persons
who
otherwise
met
the
study
’
s
eligibility
criteria
.
Limited
matching
on
age
and
sex
only
would
have
been
insufficient
to
eliminate
the
early
confounding
(
Fig
.
S6
)
.We
also
excluded
population
groups
with
high
internal
variability
in
the
probability
of
vaccination
or
outcome
,
such
as
health
care
workers
,
persons
confined
to
the
home
for
medical
reasons
,
and
nursing
home
residents
,
to
avoid
residual
confounding
.
Although
the
randomized
trial
was
also
less
likely
to
include
persons
who
were
not
healthy
enough
to
comply
with
the
scheduled
visits
and
vaccination
plan
,
it
did
not
exclude
health
care
workers.To
assess
a
possible
selection
bias
that
could
stem
from
informative
censoring
,
whereby
controls
who
are
vaccinated
feel
well
around
the
time
of
vaccination
,
we
performed
a
sensitivity
analysis
in
which
they
were
kept
in
the
unvaccinated
group
for
a
period
of
time
that
was
set
differently
for
each
outcome
(
Fig
.
S7
and
Table
S5
)
.
This
analysis
showed
results
similar
to
those
of
the
main
analysis
,
which
suggests
that
any
such
bias
was
small
in
our
analysis.Finally
,
the
date
of
onset
of
symptoms
was
not
available
for
the
analysis
.
Instead
,
for
infection
outcomes
,
the
date
was
set
to
the
date
of
swab
collection
for
the
first
positive
PCR
test
.
Given
that
there
was
likely
to
have
been
a
time
gap
between
the
onset
of
symptoms
and
swab
collection
,
the
observed
divergence
of
the
cumulative
incidence
plots
for
the
infection
outcomes
between
the
vaccinated
persons
and
unvaccinated
controls
may
be
slightly
delayed
.
In
parallel
,
there
might
be
an
underestimation
of
the
vaccine
effectiveness
at
each
time
window
,
since
the
estimate
actually
reflects
a
narrower
window
for
the
vaccine
to
be
active
.
Because
SARS-CoV-2
PCR
testing
is
highly
accessible
in
Israel
and
can
be
done
without
referral
in
a
matter
of
hours
,
we
estimate
this
potential
time
gap
and
thus
the
vaccine
effectiveness
underestimation
to
be
small
.
In
interpreting
the
effectiveness
estimates
for
more
severe
outcomes
,
longer
median
gaps
should
be
kept
in
mind
(
Fig
.
S3
)
:
1
day
for
hospitalization
,
5
days
for
severe
Covid-19
,
and
11
days
for
Covid-19
death.This
study
estimates
a
high
effectiveness
of
the
BNT162b2
vaccine
for
preventing
symptomatic
Covid-19
in
a
noncontrolled
setting
,
similar
to
the
vaccine
efficacy
reported
in
the
randomized
trial
.
Our
study
also
suggests
that
effectiveness
is
high
for
the
more
serious
outcomes
:
hospitalization
,
severe
illness
,
and
death
.
Furthermore
,
the
estimated
benefit
increases
in
magnitude
as
time
passes
.
These
results
strengthen
the
expectation
that
newly
approved
vaccines
can
help
to
mitigate
the
profound
global
effects
of
the
Covid-19
pandemic
.

As
measured
by

,
the

were
the

models
,
respectively
(
see
the
Supplementary

.
These
results
are
consistent
with
published
observations
of
convalescent
patients
with
Covid-19
through
8
months
after
symptom
onset.5Although
the
antibody
titers
and
assays
that
best
correlate
with
vaccine
efficacy
are
not
currently
known
,
antibodies
that
were
elicited
by
mRNA-1273
persisted
through
6
months
after
the
second
dose
,
as
detected
by
three
distinct
serologic
assays
.
Ongoing
studies
are
monitoring
immune
responses
beyond
6
months
as
well
as
determining
the
effect
of
a
booster
dose
to
extend
the
duration
and
breadth
of
activity
against
emerging
viral
variants
.
Our
data
show
antibody
persistence
and
thus
support
the
use
of
this
vaccine
in
addressing
the
Covid-19
pandemic.Nicole

a
nationwide
surge
in
coronavirus
disease
2019
(
Covid-19
)
has
been
noted
,
SARS-CoV-2
variants
with
increased
infectivity
have
emerged
,
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
has
granted
emergency
use
authorization
for
these
two
mRNA
vaccines
,
and
vaccination
has
been
initiated
across
the
United
States.Since
the
start
of
the
vaccination
campaign
,
the
development
of
Covid-19
has
been
reported
in
persons
who
have
received
one
or
both
doses
of
vaccine.3
Both
the
University
of
California
,
San
Diego
(
UCSD
)
and
the
University
of
California
,
Los
Angeles
(
UCLA
)
health
systems
began
to
vaccinate
health
care
workers
on
December
16
,
2020
.
On
December
2
,
in
addition
to
defining
a
low
threshold
for
testing
of
symptomatic
persons
,
UCSD
mandated
that
asymptomatic
health
care
workers
undergo
weekly
testing
by
polymerase-chain-reaction
(
PCR
)
assay
of
nasal
swabs
.
On
December
26
,
UCLA
instituted
an
optional
testing
program
for
asymptomatic
health
care
workers
with
PCR
assay
of
nasal
swabs
.
This
program
has
allowed
for
increased
detection
of
asymptomatic
SARS-CoV-2
infections
after
vaccination.Pooled
data
were
obtained
in
deidentified
format
from
an
electronic
employee
health
record
system
at
UCSD
and
UCLA.4
Exemption
from
institutional
review
board
approval
was
obtained.From
December
16
,
2020
,
through
February
9
,
2021
,
a
total
of
36,659
health
care
workers
received
the
first
dose
of
vaccine
,
and
28,184
of
these
persons
(
77
%
)
received
the
second
dose
.
Among
the
vaccinated
health
care
workers
,
379
unique
persons
tested
positive
for
SARS-CoV-2
at
least
1
day
after
vaccination
,
and
the
majority
(
71
%
)
of
these
persons
tested
positive
within
the
first
2
weeks
after
the
first
dose
.
After
receiving
both
vaccinations
,
37
health
care
workers
tested
positive
;
of
these
workers
,
22
had
positive
test
results
1
to
7
days
after
the
second
dose
.
Only
8
health
care
workers
tested
positive
8
to
14
days
after
the
second
vaccination
,
and
7
tested
positive
15
or
more
days
after
the
second
vaccination
(
Table
1
)
.
As
of
February
9
,
a
total
of
5455
health
care
workers
at
UCSD
and
9535
at
UCLA
had
received
the
second
dose
2
or
more
weeks
previously
;
these
findings
correspond
to
a
positivity
rate
of
0.05
%
.In
our
cohort
,
the
absolute
risk
of
testing
positive
for
SARS-CoV-2
after
vaccination
was
1.19
%
among
health
care
workers
at
UCSD
and
0.97
%
among
those
at
UCLA
;
these
rates
are
higher
than
the
risks
reported
in
the
trials
of
mRNA-1273
vaccine1
and
BNT162b2
vaccine.2
Possible
explanations
for
this
elevated
risk
include
the
availability
of
regular
testing
for
asymptomatic
and
symptomatic
persons
at
our
institutions
,
a
regional
surge
in
infections
in
Southern
California
during
our
vaccination
campaigns,5
and
differences
in
demographic
characteristics
between
the
trial
participants
and
the
health
care
workers
in
our
cohort
.
The
health
care
workers
were
younger
and
had
an
overall
higher
risk
of
exposure
to
SARS-CoV-2
than
the
participants
in
the
clinical
trials
.
In
addition
,
the
cutoff
dates
for
reporting
in
both
initial
vaccine
trials
were
well
before
this
surge
,
no
testing
of
asymptomatic
persons
was
included
in
the
BNT162b2
vaccine
trial,2
and
only
a
single
screening
of
asymptomatic
persons
was
performed
in
the
mRNA-1273
vaccine
trial
before
the
second
dose
was
administered.1The
rarity
of
positive
test
results
14
days
after
administration
of
the
second
dose
of
vaccine
is
encouraging
and
suggests
that
the
efficacy
of
these
vaccines
is
maintained
outside
the
trial
setting
.
These
data
underscore
the
critical
importance
of
continued
public
health
mitigation
measures
(
masking
,
physical
distancing
,
daily
symptom
screening
,
and
regular
testing
)
,
even
in
environments
with
a
high
incidence
of
vaccination
,
until
herd
immunity
is
reached

large.Jocelyn

The
COVID-19
pandemic
,
also
known
as
the
coronavirus
pandemic
,
is
an
ongoing
global
pandemic
of
coronavirus
disease
2019
(
COVID-19
)
,
which
is
caused
by
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
2
(
SARS-CoV-2
)
.
The
virus
was
first
identified
in
December
2019
in
Wuhan
,
China
.
The
World
Health
Organization
declared
a
Public
Health
Emergency
of
International
Concern
on
30
January
2020
,
and
later
declared
a
pandemic
on
11
March
2020
.
As
of
28
June
2021
,
more
than
181
million
cases
have
been
confirmed
,
with
more
than
3.92
million
confirmed
deaths
attributed
to
COVID-19
,
making
it
one
of
the
deadliest
pandemics
in
history
.
The
severity
of
COVID-19
symptoms
is
highly
variable
,
ranging
from
unnoticeable
to
life-threatening
.
Severe
illness
is
more
likely
in
elderly
COVID-19
patients
,
as
well
as
those
who
have
underlying
medical
conditions
.
COVID-19
transmits
when
people
breathe
in
air
contaminated
by
droplets
and
small
airborne
particles
.
The
risk
of
breathing
these
in
is
highest
when
people
are
in
close
proximity
,
but
they
can
be
inhaled
over
longer
distances
,
particularly
indoors
.
Transmission
can
also
occur
if
splashed
or
sprayed
with
contaminated
fluids
,
in
the
eyes
,
nose
or
mouth
,
and
,
rarely
,
via
contaminated
surfaces
.
People
remain
contagious
for
up
to
20
days
,
and
can
spread
the
virus
even
if
they
do
not
develop
any
symptoms
.
[

[

Recommended
preventive
measures
include
social
distancing
,
wearing
face
masks
in
public
,
ventilation
and
air-filtering
,
hand
washing
,
covering
one
's
mouth
when
sneezing
or
coughing
,
disinfecting
surfaces
,
and
monitoring
and
self-isolation
for
people
exposed
or
symptomatic
.
Several
vaccines
have
been
developed
and
widely
distributed
in
most
developed
countries
since
December
2020
.
Current
treatments
focus
on
addressing
symptoms
,
but
work
is
underway
to
develop
medications
that
inhibit
the
virus
.
Authorities
worldwide
have
responded
by
implementing
travel
restrictions
,
lockdowns
and
quarantines
,
workplace
hazard
controls
,
and
business
closures
.
Numerous
jurisdictions
have
also
worked
to
increase
testing
capacity
and
trace
contacts
of
the
infected
.
[

The
pandemic
has
resulted
in
severe
global
,
social
and
economic
disruption
,
including
the
largest
global
recession
since
the
Great
Depression
of
the
1930s
.
[
9
]
It
has
led
to
widespread
supply
shortages
exacerbated
by
panic
buying
,
agricultural
disruption
,
and
food
shortages
.
However
,
there
have
also
been
decreased
emissions
of
pollutants
and
greenhouse
gases
.
Numerous
educational
institutions
and
public
areas
have
been
partially
or
fully
closed
,
and
many
events
have
been
cancelled
or
postponed
.
Misinformation
has
circulated
through
social
media
and
mass
media
,
and
political
tensions
have
been
exacerbated
.
The
pandemic
has
raised
issues
of
racial
and
geographic
discrimination
,
health
equity
,
wealth
inequality
and
the
balance
between
public
health
imperatives
and
individual
rights
.
Although
the
exact
origin
of
the
virus
is
still
unknown
,
[
10
]
the
first
outbreak
started
in
Wuhan
,
Hubei
,
China
in
late
2019
.
Many
early
cases
of
COVID-19
were
linked
to
people
who
had
visited
the
Huanan
Seafood
Wholesale
Market
in
Wuhan
,
[
11
]
[
12
]
[
13
]
but
it
is
possible
that
human-to-human
transmission
was
already
happening
before
this
.
[
14
]
[
15
]
On
11
February
2020
,
the
World
Health
Organization
(
WHO
)
named
the
disease
``
COVID-19
''
,
which
is
short
for
coronavirus
disease
2019
.
[

[

The
virus
that
caused
the
outbreak
is
known
as
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
2
(
SARS-CoV-2
)
,
a
newly
discovered
virus
closely
related
to
bat
coronaviruses
,
[
18
]
pangolin
coronaviruses
,
[
19
]
[
20
]
and
SARS-CoV
.
[
21
]
The
current
scientific
consensus
is
that
the
virus
is
most
likely
of
zoonotic
origin
,
from
bats
or
another
closely-related
mammal
.
[

[
23

[
24

[

]
Despite
this
,
the
subject
has
generated
a
significant
amount
of
speculation
and
conspiracy
theories
,
[
25
]
[
15
]
which
were
amplified
by
rapidly
growing
online
echo
chambers
.
[
26
]
Global
geopolitical
divisions
,
notably
between
the
United
States
and
China
,
have
been
heightened
because
of
this
issue
.
[
27
]
[
28
]
[
29
]
The
earliest
known
person
with
symptoms
was
later
discovered
to
have
fallen
ill
on
1
December
2019
,
and
that
person
did
not
have
visible
connections
with
the
later
wet
market
cluster
.
[

[

However
,
an
earlier
case
of
infection
could
have
occurred
on

the
number
of

positive
according

[

An
analysis
of
the
early
phase
of
the
outbreak
up
to
23
January
estimated
86
per
cent
of
COVID-19
infections
had
not
been
detected
,
and
that
these
undocumented
infections
were
the
source
for
79
per
cent
of
documented
cases
.
[
42
]
Several
other
studies
,
using
a
variety
of
methods
,
have
estimated
that
numbers
of
infections
in
many
countries
are
likely
to
be
considerably
greater
than
the
reported
cases
.

On
9
April
2020
,
preliminary
results
found
that
15
per

of
people
tested
in
Gangelt

the
centre
of
a
major
infection
cluster
in
Germany
,
tested

found
rates
of

that
may
indicate
more
infections
than
reported
.
[

[

Seroprevalence
based
estimates
are
conservative
as
some
studies
show
that
persons
with
mild
symptoms
do
not
have
detectable
antibodies
.
[

Some
results
(
such
as
the
Gangelt
study
)
have
received
substantial
press
coverage
without

passing
through

An
analysis
in
early
2020
of
cases
by
age
in
China
indicated
that
a
relatively
low
proportion
of
cases
occurred
in
individuals
under
20
.
[
50
]
It
was
not
clear
whether
this
was
because
young
people
were
less
likely
to
be
infected
,
or
less
likely
to
develop
serious
symptoms
and
seek
medical
attention
and
be
tested
.
[
51
]
A
retrospective
cohort
study
in
China
found
that
children
and
adults
were
just
as
likely
to
be
infected
.
[

Initial
estimates
of
the
basic
reproduction
number
(
R0
)
for
COVID-19
in
January
were
between
1.4
and
2.5
,
[
53
]
but
a
subsequent
analysis
concluded
that
it
may
be
about
5.7
(
with
a
95
per
cent
confidence
interval
of
3.8
to
8.9
)
.
[
54
]
R0
can
vary
across
populations
and
is
not
to
be
confused
with
the
effective
reproduction
number
(
commonly
just
called
R
)
,
which
takes
into
account
effects
such
as
social
distancing
and
herd
immunity
.
By
mid-May
2020
,
the
effective
R
was
close
to
or
below
1.0
in
many
countries
,
meaning
the
spread
of
the
disease
in
these
areas
at
that
time
was
stable
or
decreasing

Official
deaths
from
COVID-19
generally
refer
to
people
who
died
after

positive

to
protocols

These
counts
may
ignore
deaths
of
people
who
die

having
been

Conversely
,
deaths

[

Comparisons
of
statistics
for

June
2021
,
more
than
3.92
million

deaths
have
been
attributed
to
COVID-19
.
People
at
the
greatest
risk
of
mortality
from
COVID-19
tend
to
be
those
with
underlying
conditions
,
such
as
those
with

Multiple
measures
are

[

Countries
like
Belgium
include
deaths
from
suspected
cases
of
COVID-19
,
regardless
of
whether
the
person
was
tested
,
resulting
in
higher
numbers
compared
to
countries
that

[

The
death-to-case
ratio
reflects
the
number
of
deaths
attributed
to
COVID-19
divided
by
the
number

within
a

The
official
death

have
been
criticised
for

the
actual
death
toll
,
because
comparisons
of
death
rates
before

On
24
March
2020
,
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
(
CDC
)
of
the
United
States
,
indicated
the
WHO
had
provided
two
codes
for
COVID-19
:
U07.1
when
confirmed
by
laboratory
testing
and
U07.2
for
clinically
or
epidemiological
diagnosis
where
laboratory
confirmation
is
inconclusive
or
not
available
.
[
77

[
78

The
CDC
noted
that
``
Because
laboratory
test
results
are
not
typically
reported
on
death
certificates
in
the
U.S.
,
[
the
National
Center
for
Health
Statistics
(
NCHS
)
]
is
not
planning
to
implement
U07.2
for
mortality
statistics
''
and
that
U07.1
would
be
used
``
If
the
death
certificate
reports
terms
such
as
'probable
COVID-19
'
or
'likely
COVID-19
'
.
''
The
CDC
also
noted
``
It
Is
not
likely
that
NCHS
will
follow
up
on
these
cases
''
and
while
the
``
underlying
cause
depends
upon
what

where
conditions
are
reported
on
the
death

,
...
the
rules
for
coding

selection
of

are
expected
to
result
in

the
underlying
cause
more
often
than

``
[

On
16
April
2020
,
the
WHO
,
in
its
formal
publication
of
the
two
codes
,
U07.1
and
U07.2
,
``
recognized
that
in
many
countries
detail
as
to
the
laboratory
confirmation
...
will
not
be
reported
[
and
]
recommended
,
for
mortality
purposes
only
,
to
code
COVID-19
provisionally
to
code
U07.1
unless
it
is
stated
as
'probable
'
or
'suspected
'
.
``
[
79
]
[
80

It
was
also
noted
that
the
WHO
``
does
not
distinguish
''
between
infection
by
SARS-CoV-2
and
COVID-19
.
[
81

A
crucial
metric
in
assessing
the
severity
of
a
disease
is
the
infection
fatality
ratio
(
IFR
)
,
which
is
the
cumulative
number
of
deaths
attributed
to
the
disease
divided
by
the
cumulative
number
of
infected
individuals
(
including
asymptomatic
and
undiagnosed
infections
)
as
measured
or
estimated
as
of
a
specific
date
.
[
82
]
[
83
]
[
84
]
Epidemiologists
frequently
refer
to
this
metric
as
the
'infection
fatality
rate
'
to
clarify
that
it
is
expressed
in
percentage
points
(
not
as
a
decimal
)
.
[
85
]
[
86
]
[
87
]
Other
published
studies
refer
to
this
metric
as
the
'infection
fatality
risk
'
.
[

[

In
November
2020
,
a
review
article
in
Nature
reported
estimates
of
population-weighted
IFRs
for
a
number
of
countries
,
excluding
deaths
in
elderly
care
facilities
,
and
found
a
median
range
of
0.24
%
to
1.49
%
.
[
90
]
In
December
2020
,
a
systematic
review
and
meta-analysis
published
in
the
European
Journal
of
Epidemiology
estimated
that
population-weighted
IFR
was
0.5
%
to
1
%
in
some
countries
(
France
,
Netherlands
,
New
Zealand
,
and
Portugal
)
,
1
%
to
2
%
in
several
other
countries
(
Australia
,
England
,
Lithuania
,
and
Spain
)
,
and
about
2.5
%
in
Italy
;
these
estimates
included
fatalities
in
elderly
care
facilities
.
[
91
]
This
study
also
found
that
most
of
the
differences
in
IFR
across
locations
reflected
corresponding
differences
in
the
age
composition
of
the
population
and
the
age-specific
pattern
of
infection
rates
,
due
to
very
low
IFRs
for
children
and
younger
adults
(
e.g.
,
0.002
%
at
age
10
and
0.01
%
at
age
25
)
and
progressively
higher
IFRs
for
older
adults
(
0.4
%
at
age
55
,
1.4
%
at
age
65
,
4.6
%
at
age
75
,
and
15
%
at
age
85
)
.
[
91
]
These
results
were
also
highlighted
in
a
December
2020
report
issued
by
the
World
Health
Organization
.
[
92
]
An
analysis
of
those
IFR
rates
indicates
that
COVID-19
is
hazardous
not
only
for
the
elderly
but
also
for
middle-aged
adults
,
for
whom
a
fatal
COVID-19
infection
is
two
orders
of
magnitude
more
likely
than
the
annualised
risk
of
a
fatal
automobile
accident
and
far
more
dangerous
than
seasonal
influenza
.
[
91
]
Another
metric
in
assessing
death
rate
is
the
case
fatality
ratio
(
CFR
)
,
[
a
]
which
is
deaths
attributed
to
disease
divided
by
individuals
diagnosed
to-date
.
This
metric
can
be
misleading
because
of
the
delay
between
symptom
onset
and
death
and
because
testing
focuses
on
individuals
with
symptoms
(
and
particularly
on
those
manifesting
more
severe
symptoms
)
.
[
81
]
On
4
August
2020
,
WHO
indicated
``
at
this
early
stage
of
the
pandemic
,
most
estimates
of
fatality
ratios
have
been
based
on
cases
detected
through
surveillance
and
calculated
using
crude
methods
,
giving
rise
to
widely
variable
estimates
of
CFR
by
country
–
from
less
than
0.1
%
to
over
25
%
.
``
[
83
]
Symptoms
of
COVID-19
are
variable
,
ranging
from
mild
symptoms
to
severe
illness
.
[
93
]
[
94
]
Common
symptoms
include
headache
,
[
95
]
loss
of
smell
[
96
]
and
taste
,
[
97
]
nasal
congestion
and
runny
nose
,
cough
,
muscle
pain
,
sore
throat
,
fever
,
[
98
]
diarrhea
,
and
breathing
difficulties
.
[
99
]
People
with
the
same
infection
may
have
different
symptoms
,
and
their
symptoms
may
change
over
time
.
Three
common
clusters
of
symptoms
have
been
identified
:
one
respiratory
symptom
cluster
with
cough
,
sputum
,
shortness
of
breath
,
and
fever
;
a
musculoskeletal
symptom
cluster
with
muscle
and
joint
pain
,
headache
,
and
fatigue
;
a
cluster
of
digestive
symptoms
with
abdominal
pain
,
vomiting
,
and
diarrhea
.
[
99
]
In
people
without
prior
ear
,
nose
,
and
throat
disorders
,
loss
of
taste
combined
with
loss
of
smell
is
associated
with
COVID-19
.
[
100
]
Of
people
who
show
symptoms
,
81
%
develop
only
mild
to
moderate
symptoms
(
up
to
mild
pneumonia
)
,
while
14
%
develop
severe
symptoms
(
dyspnea
,
hypoxia
,
or
more
than
50
%
lung
involvement
on
imaging
)
and
5
%
of
patients
suffer
critical
symptoms
(
respiratory
failure
,
shock
,
or
multiorgan
dysfunction
)
.
[
101
]
At
least
a
third
of
the
people
who
are
infected
with
the
virus
do
not
develop
noticeable
symptoms
at
any
point
in
time
.
[
102
]
[
103
]
[
104
]
[
105
]
These
asymptomatic
carriers
tend
not
to
get
tested
and
can
spread
the
disease
.
[
105
]
[
106
]
[
107
]
[
108
]
Other
infected
people
will
develop
symptoms
later
,
called
``
pre-symptomatic
''
,
or
have
very
mild
symptoms
and
can
also
spread
the
virus
.
[
108
]
As
is
common
with
infections
,
there
is
a
delay
between
the
moment
a
person
first
becomes
infected
and
the
appearance
of
the
first
symptoms
.
The
median
delay
for
COVID-19
is
four
to
five
days
.
[
109
]
Most
symptomatic
people
experience
symptoms
within
two
to
seven
days
after
exposure
,
and
almost
all
will
experience
at
least
one
symptom
within
12
days
.
[
109
]
[
110
]
The
disease
is
mainly
transmitted
via
the
respiratory
route
when
people
inhale
droplets
and
particles
that
infected
people
release
as
they
breathe
,
talk
,
cough
,
sneeze
,
or
sing
.
[
112
]
Infected
people
are
more
likely
to
transmit
COVID-19
the
when
they
are
physically
close
.
However
,
infection
can
occur
over
longer
distances
,
particularly
indoors
.
[
112
]
Infectivity
begins
as
early
as
three
days
before
symptoms
appear
,
and
people
are
most
infectious
just
prior
to
and
during
the
onset
of
symptoms
.
[
113
]
It
declines
after
the
first
week
,
but
infected
people
remain
contagious
for
up
to
20
days
.
People
can
spread
the
disease
even
if
they
are
asymptomatic
.
[
114
]
[
115
]
[
113
]
Infectious
particles
range
in
size
from
aerosols
that
remain
suspended
in
the
air
for
long
periods
of
time
to
larger
droplets
that
remain
airborne
or
fall
to
the
ground

terms
such
as
``
airborne

and
``
droplet

both
in
technical
and
general
ways

confusion
around
terminology

Additionally
,
COVID-19
research
has
redefined
the
traditional
understanding
of
how
respiratory
viruses
transmit
.
[
116
]
[
118
]
The
largest
droplets
of
respiratory
fluid
do
not
travel
far
,
and
can
be
inhaled
or
land
on
mucous
membranes
on
the
eyes
,
nose
,
or
mouth
to
infect
.
[
112
]
Aerosols
are
highest
in
concentration
when
people
are
in
close
proximity
,
which
leads
to
easier
viral
transmission
when
people
are
physically
close
,
[
112
]
[
116
]
[
118
]
but
airborne
transmission
can
occur
at
longer
distances
,
mainly
in
locations
that
are
poorly
ventilated
;
[
112
]
in
those
conditions
small
particles
can
remain
suspended
in
the
air
for
minutes
to
hours

SARS‑CoV‑2
belongs
to
the
broad
family
of
viruses
known
as
coronaviruses
.
[
122
]
It
is
a
positive-sense
single-stranded
RNA
(
+ssRNA
)
virus
,
with
a
single
linear
RNA
segment
.
Coronaviruses
infect
humans
,
other
mammals
,
and
avian
species
,
including
livestock
and
companion
animals
.
[

Human
coronaviruses
are
capable
of
causing
illnesses
ranging
from
the
common
cold
to
more
severe
diseases
such
as
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
(
MERS
,
fatality
rate
~34
%
)
.
SARS-CoV-2
is
the
seventh
known
coronavirus
to
infect
people
,
after
229E
,
NL63
,
OC43
,
HKU1
,
MERS-CoV
,
and
the
original
SARS-CoV
.
[

Preventive
measures
to
reduce
the
chances
of
infection
include
getting
vaccinated
,
staying
at
home
,
wearing
a
mask
in
public
,
avoiding
crowded
places
,
keeping
distance
from
others
,
ventilating
indoor
spaces
,
managing
potential
exposure
durations
,
[

On
4
February
2020
,
US
Secretary
of
Health
and
Human
Services
Alex
Azar
published
a
notice
of
declaration
under
the
Public
Readiness
and
Emergency
Preparedness
Act
for
medical
countermeasures
against
COVID-19
,
covering
``
any
vaccine
,
used
to

,
prevent
,
or
mitigate
COVID-19
,
or
the
transmission
of
SARS-CoV-2
or
a
virus
mutating
therefrom
''
,
and
stating
that
the
declaration
precludes
``
liability
claims
alleging
negligence
by
a
manufacturer
in
creating
a
vaccine
,
or
negligence
by
a
health
care
provider
in
prescribing
the
wrong
dose
,
absent
willful
misconduct
''
.
[
155
]
The
declaration
is
effective
in
the
United
States
through
1
October
2024
.
[
156
]
On
8
December
it
was
reported
that
the
AstraZeneca
vaccine
is
about
70
%
effective
,
according
to
a
study
.
[
157
]
By
mid-June
2021
,
85
percent
of
vaccinations
have
been
administered
in
high-
and
upper-middle-income
countries
.
Only
0.3
percent
of
doses
have
been
administered
in
low-income
countries
.
[

There
is
no
specific
,
effective
treatment
or
cure
for
coronavirus
disease
2019
(

)
,
the
disease
caused
by
the
SARS-CoV-2

.
[

[

Thus
,
the
cornerstone
of
management
of
COVID-19
is
supportive
care
,
which
includes
treatment
to
relieve
symptoms
,
fluid
therapy
,
oxygen
support
and
prone
positioning
as
needed
,
and
medications
or
devices
to
support
other
affected
vital
organs
.
[

[
162
]
[
163
]
Most
cases
of
COVID-19
are
mild
.
In
these
,
supportive
care
includes
medication
such
as
paracetamol
or
NSAIDs
to
relieve
symptoms
(
fever
,
[
164
]
body
aches
,
cough
)
,
proper
intake
of
fluids
,
rest
,
and
nasal
breathing
.
[
165
]
[
160
]
[
166
]
[
167
]
Good
personal
hygiene
and
a
healthy
diet
are
also
recommended
.
[
168
]
The
U.S.
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
(
CDC
)
recommend
that
those
who
suspect
they
are
carrying
the
virus
isolate
themselves
at
home
and
wear
a
face
mask
.
[
169
]
People
with
more
severe
cases
may
need
treatment
in
hospital
.
In
those
with
low
oxygen
levels
,
use
of
the
glucocorticoid
dexamethasone
is
strongly
recommended
,
as
it
can
reduce
the
risk
of
death
.
[
170
]
[
171
]
[
172
]
Noninvasive
ventilation
and
,
ultimately
,
admission
to
an
intensive
care
unit
for
mechanical
ventilation
may
be
required
to
support
breathing
.
[

Extracorporeal
membrane
oxygenation
(
ECMO
)
has
been
used
to
address
the
issue
of
respiratory
failure
,
but
its
benefits
are
still
under
consideration
.
[
174
]
[
175
]
Several
experimental
treatments
are
being
actively
studied
in
clinical
trials
.
[
159
]
Others
were
thought
to
be
promising
early
in
the
pandemic
,
such
as
hydroxychloroquine
and
lopinavir/ritonavir
,
but
later
research
found
them
to
be
ineffective
or
even
harmful
.
[
159
]
[
176
]
[
177
]
Despite
ongoing
research
,
there
is
still
not
enough
high-quality
evidence
to
recommend
so-called
early
treatment
.
[
176
]
[
177
]
Nevertheless
,
in
the
United
States
,
two
monoclonal
antibody-based
therapies
are
available
for
early
use
in
cases
thought
to
be
at
high
risk
of
progression
to
severe
disease
.

The
antiviral
remdesivir
is
available
in
the
U.S.
,
Canada
,
Australia
,
and
several
other
countries
,
with
varying
restrictions
;
however
,
it
is
not
recommended
for
people
needing
mechanical
ventilation
,
and
is
discouraged
altogether
by
the
World
Health
Organization
(
WHO
)
,
[
178
]
due
to
limited
evidence
of
its
efficacy
.
[
159
]
Several
variants
of
SARS-CoV-2
have
emerged
that
are
spreading
globally
.
The
most
currently
prevalent
,
all
of
which
share
the
more
infectious
D614G
mutation
,
are
:
[
179
]
[
180
]
Speed
and
scale
are
key
to
mitigation
,
due
to
the
fat-tailed
nature
of
pandemic
risk
and
the
exponential
growth
of
COVID-19
infections
.
[
187
]
For
mitigation
to
be
effective
,
(
a
)
chains
of
transmission
must
be
broken
as
quickly
as
possible
through
screening
and
containment
,
(
b
)
health
care
must
be
available
to
provide
for
the
needs
of
those
infected
,
and
(
c
)
contingencies
must
be
in
place
to
allow
for
effective
rollout
of
(
a
)
and
(
b
)
.
Strategies
in
the
control
of
an
outbreak
are
screening
,
containment
(
or
suppression
)
,
and
mitigation
.
Screening
is
done
with
a
device
such
as
a
thermometer
to
detect
the
elevated
body
temperature
associated
with
fevers
caused
by
the
infection
.
[
191
]
Containment
is
undertaken
in
the
early
stages
of
the
outbreak
and
aims
to
trace
and
isolate
those
infected
as
well
as
introduce
other
measures
to
stop
the
disease
from
spreading
.
When
it
is
no
longer
possible
to
contain
the
disease
,
efforts
then
move
to
the
mitigation
stage
:
measures
are
taken
to
slow
the
spread
and
mitigate
its
effects
on
the
healthcare
system
and
society
.
A
combination
of
both
containment
and
mitigation
measures
may
be
undertaken
at
the
same
time
.
[
192
]
Suppression
requires
more
extreme
measures
so
as
to
reverse
the
pandemic
by
reducing
the
basic
reproduction
number
to
less
than
1
.
[
193
]
Part
of
managing
an
infectious
disease
outbreak
is
trying
to
delay
and
decrease
the
epidemic
peak
,
known
as
flattening
the
epidemic
curve
.
[
188
]
This
decreases
the
risk
of
health
services
being
overwhelmed
and
provides
more
time
for
vaccines
and
treatments
to
be
developed
.
[
188
]
Non-pharmaceutical
interventions
that
may
manage
the
outbreak
include
personal
preventive
measures
such
as
hand
hygiene
,
wearing
face
masks
,
and
self-quarantine
;
community
measures
aimed
at
physical
distancing
such
as
closing
schools
and
cancelling
mass
gathering
events
;
community
engagement
to
encourage
acceptance
and
participation
in
such
interventions
;
as
well
as
environmental
measures
such
surface
cleaning
.
[
194
]
Some
measures
,
particularly
those
that
focus
on
cleaning
surfaces
rather
than
preventing
airborne
transmission
,
have
been
criticised
as
hygiene
theatre
.
[
195
]
More
drastic
actions
aimed
at
containing
the
outbreak
were
taken
in
China
once
the
severity
of
the
outbreak
became
apparent
,
such
as
quarantining
entire
cities
and
imposing
strict
travel
bans
.
[
196
]
Other
countries
also
adopted
a
variety
of
measures
aimed
at
limiting
the
spread
of
the
virus
.
South
Korea
introduced
mass
screening
and
localised
quarantines
and
issued
alerts
on
the
movements
of
infected
individuals
.
Singapore
provided
financial
support
for
those
infected
who
quarantined
themselves
and
imposed
large
fines
for
those
who
failed
to
do
so
.
Taiwan
increased
face
mask
production
and
penalised
the
hoarding
of
medical
supplies
.
[
197
]
Simulations
for
Great
Britain
and
the
United
States
show
that
mitigation
(
slowing
but
not
stopping
epidemic
spread
)
and
suppression
(
reversing
epidemic
growth
)
have
major
challenges
.
Optimal
mitigation
policies
might
reduce
peak
healthcare
demand
by
two-thirds
and
deaths
by
half
,
but
still
result
in
hundreds
of
thousands
of
deaths
and
overwhelmed
health
systems
.
Suppression
can
be
preferred
but
needs
to
be
maintained
for
as
long
as
the
virus
is
circulating
in
the
human
population
(
or
until
a
vaccine
becomes
available
)
,
as
transmission
otherwise
quickly
rebounds
when
measures
are
relaxed
.
Long-term
intervention
to
suppress
the
pandemic
has
considerable
social
and
economic
costs
.
[
193
]
Contact
tracing
is
an
important
method
for
health
authorities
to
determine
the
source
of
infection
and
to
prevent
further
transmission
.
[
198
]
The
use
of
location
data
from
mobile
phones
by
governments
for
this
purpose
has
prompted
privacy
concerns
,
with
Amnesty
International
and
more
than
a
hundred
other
organisations
issuing
a
statement
calling
for
limits
on
this
kind
of
surveillance
.
[
199
]
Several
mobile
apps
have
been
implemented
or
proposed
for
voluntary
use
,
and
as
of
7
April
2020
more
than
a
dozen
expert
groups
were
working
on
privacy-friendly
solutions
such
as
using
Bluetooth
to
log
a
user
's
proximity
to
other
cellphones
.
[
199

(
Users
are
alerted
if
they
have
been
near
someone
who
subsequently
tests
positive
.
)
[

]
On
10
April
2020
,
Google
and
Apple
jointly
announced
an
initiative
for
privacy-preserving
contact
tracing
based
on
Bluetooth
technology
and
cryptography
.
[
200
]
[
201
]
The
system
is
intended
to
allow
governments
to
create
official
privacy-preserving
coronavirus
tracking
apps
,
with
the
eventual
goal
of
integration
of
this
functionality
directly
into
the
iOS
and
Android
mobile
platforms
.
[
202
]
In
Europe
and
in
the
U.S.
,
Palantir
Technologies
is
also
providing
COVID-19
tracking
services
.
[
203
]
Increasing
capacity
and
adapting
healthcare
for
the
needs
of
COVID-19
patients
is
described
by
the
WHO
as
a
fundamental
outbreak
response
measure
.
[
204
]
The
ECDC
and
the
European
regional
office
of
the
WHO
have
issued
guidelines
for
hospitals
and
primary
healthcare
services
for
shifting
of
resources
at
multiple
levels
,
including
focusing
laboratory
services
towards
COVID-19
testing
,
cancelling
elective
procedures
whenever
possible
,
separating
and
isolating
COVID-19
positive
patients
,
and
increasing
intensive
care
capabilities
by
training
personnel
and
increasing
the
number
of
available
ventilators
and
beds
.
[

In
addition
,
in
an
attempt
to
maintain
physical
distancing
,
and
to
protect
both
patients
and
clinicians
,
in
some
areas
non-emergency
healthcare
services
are
being
provided
virtually
.

Due
to
capacity
limitations
in
the
standard
supply
chains
,
some
manufacturers
are
3D
printing
healthcare
material
such
as
nasal
swabs
and
ventilator
parts
.
[

In
one
example
,
when
an
Italian
hospital
urgently
required
a
ventilator
valve
,
and
the
supplier
was
unable
to
deliver
in
the
timescale
required
,
a
local
startup
received
legal
threats
due
to
alleged
patent
infringement
after
reverse-engineering
and
printing
the
required
hundred
valves
overnight

[

On
30
December
2019
,
a
test
report
addressed
to
Wuhan
Central
Hospital
,
from
company
CapitalBio
Medlab
,
stated
that
there
was
an
erroneous
positive
result
for
SARS
,
causing
a
group
of
doctors
at
Wuhan
Central
Hospital
to
alert
their
colleagues
and
relevant
hospital
authorities
of
the
result
.
Eight
of
those
doctors
,
including
Li
Wenliang
(
who
was
also
punished
on
3
January
)
,
[
221
]
were
later
admonished
by
the
police
for
spreading
false
rumours
;
and
another
doctor
,
Ai
Fen
,
was
reprimanded
by
her
superiors
for
raising
the
alarm
.
[
222

That
evening
,
the
Wuhan
Municipal
Health
Commission
issued
a
notice
to
various
medical
institutions
about
``
the
treatment
of
pneumonia
of
unknown
cause
''
.
[
223
]
The
next
day
,
the
Wuhan
Municipal
Health
Commission
made
the
first
public
announcement
of
a
pneumonia
outbreak
of
unknown
cause
,
confirming
27
cases
[
224
]
[
225
]
[
226
]
—enough
to
trigger
an
investigation
.
[
227
]
The
following
day
,
on
31
December
,
the
WHO
office
in
China
was
informed
of
cases
of
pneumonia
of
unknown
cause
in
Wuhan
.
[
228
]
[
224
]
An
investigation
was
launched
at
the
start
of
January
2020
.
[
227
]
According
to
official
Chinese
sources
,
the
early
cases
were
mostly
linked
to
the
Huanan
Seafood
Wholesale
Market
,
which
also
sold
live
animals
.
[

However
,
in
May
2020
,
George
Gao
,
the
director
of
the
Chinese
Center
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
,
said
animal
samples
collected
from
the
seafood
market
had
tested
negative
for
the
virus
,
indicating
the
market
was
not
the
source
of
the
initial
outbreak
.
[
230
]
In
March
2021
,
the
WHO
published
their
report
on
the
potential
zoonotic
source
of
the
virus
.
The
WHO
concluded
that
human
spillover
via
an
intermediate
animal
host
was
the
most
likely
explanation
,
with
direct
spillover
from
bats
next
most
likely
and
introduction
through
the
food
supply
chain
as
another
possible
explanation
.

From

On

January
,
WHO
received
further
information
from
the
Chinese
National
Health
Commission
that
the
outbreak
is
associated
with
exposures
in
one
seafood
market
in
Wuhan
,
and
that
the
Chinese
authorities
had
identified
a
new
type
of

,
which
was
isolated
on
7
January
.
[

During
the
early
stages
of
the
outbreak
,
the
number
of
cases
doubled
approximately
every
seven

a
half
days
.
[

In
early

mid-January
,
the
virus
spread
to
other
Chinese
provinces

a
transport
hub

asked
for
a
complete
lockdown
of
the
peninsular
nation
due
to
the
pandemic
.
[

On
the
10th
,
a
day
before
,
Italy
surpassed
1
million
confirmed
COVID-19
cases
.
[

]
On
23
November
,
it
was
reported
that
the
second
wave
of
the
virus
has
caused
some
hospitals
in
Italy
to
stop
accepting
patients
.
[

The
virus
was
first
confirmed
to
have
spread
to
Spain
on
31
January
2020
,
when
a
German
tourist
tested
positive
for
SARS-CoV-2
in
La
Gomera
,
Canary
Islands
.
[

Post-hoc
genetic
analysis
has
shown
that
at

15
strains
of
the
virus
had
been
imported
,
and
community
transmission
began
by
mid-February
.
[

By
13
March
,
cases
had
been
confirmed
in
all
50
provinces
of
the

.
A
lockdown
was
imposed
on

On
29
March
,
it
was
announced
that
,
beginning
the

,
all
non-essential
workers
were
ordered
to
remain
at

for
the
next
14

By
late
March
,
the
Community
of
Madrid
has
recorded
the
most
cases
and
deaths
in
the
country
.
Medical
professionals
and
those
who
live
in
retirement
homes
have
experienced
especially
high
infection
rates
.
[

On
25
March
,
the
official
death
toll
in
Spain
surpassed
that
of
mainland
China
.
[

]
On
2
April
,
950
people
died
of
the
virus
in
a
24-hour
period—at
the
time
,
the
most
by
any
country
in
a
single
day
.
[
420

On
17
May
,
the
daily
death
toll
announced
by
the
Spanish
government
fell
below
100
for
the
first
time
,
[
421

and
1
June
was
the
first
day
without
deaths
by
COVID-19
.
[

]
The
state
of
alarm
ended
on
21
June
.
[
423
]
However
,
the
number
of
cases
increased
again
in
July
in
a
number
of
cities
including
Barcelona
,
Zaragoza
and
Madrid
,
which
led
to
reimposition
of
some
restrictions
but
no
national
lockdown
.

Sweden
differed
from
most
other
European
countries
in
that
it
mostly
remained
open
.
[
437
]
Per
the
Swedish
Constitution
,
the
Public
Health
Agency
of
Sweden
has
autonomy
which
prevents
political
interference
and
the
agency
's
policy
favoured
forgoing
a
lockdown
.
The
Swedish
strategy
focused
on
measures
that
could
be
put
in
place
over
a
longer
period
of
time
,
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
virus
would
start
spreading
again
after
a
shorter
lockdown
.

The
New

Times
said
that
,
as
of
May
2020
,
the
outbreak
had
been
far
deadlier
there
but
the
economic
impact
had
been
reduced
as
Swedes
have
continued
to
go
to
work
,
restaurants
,

shopping
.

On

Devolution
in

frequently
speaking
out

Most
of

[

A
consensus
report
by
American
intelligence
agencies
in
April
2021
concluded
,
``
Efforts
to
contain
and
manage
the
virus
have
reinforced
nationalist
trends
globally
,
as
some
states
turned
inward
to
protect
their
citizens
and
sometimes
cast
blame
on
marginalized
groups
.
''
Furthermore
,
COVID-19
has
inflamed
partisanship
and
polarisation
around
the
world
as
bitter
arguments
explode
over
whom
to
scapegoat
and
whom
to
help
first
.
The
risks
include
further
disruption
of
international
trade
and
the
formation
of
no-entry
enclaves
.
[
516

As
a
result
of
the
pandemic
,
many
countries
and
regions
imposed
quarantines
,
entry
bans
,
or
other
restrictions
,
either
for
citizens
,
recent
travellers
to
affected
areas
,
[
517
]
or
for
all
travellers
.
[
518
]
Together
with
a
decreased
willingness
to
travel
,
this
had
a
negative
economic
and
social
impact
on
the
travel
sector
.
Concerns
have
been
raised
over
the
effectiveness
of
travel
restrictions
to
contain
the
spread
of
COVID-19
.
[
519
]
A
study
in
Science
found
that
travel
restrictions
had
only
modestly
affected
the
initial
spread
of
COVID-19
,
unless
combined
with
infection
prevention
and
control
measures
to
considerably
reduce
transmissions
.
[
520
]
Researchers
concluded
that
``
travel
restrictions
are
most
useful
in
the
early
and
late
phase
of
an
epidemic
''
and
``
restrictions
of
travel
from
Wuhan
unfortunately
came
too
late
''

The
United

Conference
on

has
been
criticised
for
a
slow
coordinated
response

open
up
humanitarian

The

In
several
countries
,
protests
have
risen
against
governmental
restrictive
responses
to

A

The

been
blamed
for

,
and
disruption
to

[

The
spread
of

been
found
to
stem
from
perceived
threat
,
perceived

factors

This
is
mainly
due

–
linked

it

The

School

Coronaviruses
are
a
group
of
related
RNA
viruses
that
cause
diseases
in
mammals
and
birds
.
In
humans
and
birds
,
they
cause
respiratory
tract
infections
that
can
range
from
mild
to
lethal
.
Mild
illnesses
in
humans
include
some
cases
of
the
common
cold
(
which
is
also
caused
by
other
viruses
,
predominantly
rhinoviruses
)
,
while
more
lethal
varieties
can
cause
SARS
,
MERS
,
and
COVID-19
.
In
cows
and
pigs
they
cause
diarrhea
,
while
in
mice
they
cause
hepatitis
and
encephalomyelitis
.
Coronaviruses
constitute
the
subfamily
Orthocoronavirinae
,
in
the
family
Coronaviridae
,
order
Nidovirales
,
and
realm
Riboviria
.
[

]
[
5
]
They
are
enveloped
viruses
with
a
positive-sense
single-stranded
RNA
genome
and
a
nucleocapsid
of
helical
symmetry
.
[
6
]
The
genome
size
of
coronaviruses
ranges
from
approximately
26
to
32
kilobases
,
one
of
the
largest
among
RNA
viruses
.
[
7
]
They
have
characteristic
club-shaped
spikes
that
project
from
their
surface
,
which
in
electron
micrographs
create
an
image
reminiscent
of
the
solar
corona
,
from
which
their
name
derives
.
[
8
]
The
name
``
coronavirus
''
is
derived
from
Latin
corona
,
meaning
``
crown
''
or
``
wreath
''
,
itself
a
borrowing
from
Greek
κορώνη
korṓnē
,
``
garland
,
wreath
''
.
[
9
]
[
10
]
The
name
was
coined
by
June
Almeida
and
David
Tyrrell
who
first
observed
and
studied
human
coronaviruses
.
[
11
]
The
word
was
first
used
in
print
in
1968
by
an
informal
group
of
virologists
in
the
journal
Nature
to
designate
the
new
family
of
viruses
.
[
8
]
The
name
refers
to
the
characteristic
appearance
of
virions
(
the
infective
form
of
the
virus
)
by
electron
microscopy
,
which
have
a
fringe
of
large
,
bulbous
surface
projections
creating
an
image
reminiscent
of
the
solar
corona
or
halo
.
[
8
]
[
11
]
This
morphology
is
created
by
the
viral
spike
peplomers
,
which
are
proteins
on
the
surface
of
the
virus
.
[
12
]
The
scientific
name
Coronavirus
was
accepted
as
a
genus
name
by
the
International
Committee
for
the
Nomenclature
of
Viruses
(
later
renamed
International
Committee
on
Taxonomy
of
Viruses
)
in
1971
.
[
13
]
As
the
number
of
new
species
increased
,
the
genus
was
split
into
four
genera
,
namely
Alphacoronavirus
,
Betacoronavirus
,
Deltacoronavirus
,
and
Gammacoronavirus
in
2009
.
[
14
]
The
common
name
coronavirus
is
used
to
refer
to
any
member
of
the
subfamily
Orthocoronavirinae
.
[
5
]
As
of
2020
,
45
species
are
officially
recognised
.
[
15
]
The
earliest
reports
of
a
coronavirus
infection
in
animals
occurred
in
the
late
1920s
,
when
an
acute
respiratory
infection
of
domesticated
chickens
emerged
in
North
America
.
[
16
]
Arthur
Schalk
and
M.C
.
Hawn
in
1931
made
the
first
detailed
report
which
described
a
new
respiratory
infection
of
chickens
in
North
Dakota
.
The
infection
of
new-born
chicks
was
characterized
by
gasping
and
listlessness
with
high
mortality
rates
of
40–90
%
.
[
17
]
Leland
David
Bushnell
and
Carl
Alfred
Brandly
isolated
the
virus
that
caused
the
infection
in
1933
.
[
18
]
The
virus
was
then
known
as
infectious
bronchitis
virus
(
IBV
)
.
Charles
D.
Hudson
and
Fred
Robert
Beaudette
cultivated
the
virus
for
the
first
time
in
1937
.
[
19
]
The
specimen
came
to
be
known
as
the
Beaudette
strain
.
In
the
late
1940s
,
two
more
animal
coronaviruses
,
JHM
that
causes
brain
disease
(
murine
encephalitis
)
and
mouse
hepatitis
virus
(
MHV
)
that
causes
hepatitis
in
mice
were
discovered
.
[

It
was
not
realized
at
the
time
that
these
three
different
viruses
were
related
.
[

Human
coronaviruses
were
discovered
in
the
1960s
[
22

[
23

using
two
different
methods
in
the
United
Kingdom

at
the
Common
Cold
Unit
of
the
British
Medical
Research

collected
a
unique
common
cold
virus
designated
B814
in
1961
.
[
25
]
[

The
virus
could
not
be
cultivated
using
standard
techniques
which
had
successfully
cultivated
rhinoviruses
,
adenoviruses
and
other
known
common
cold
viruses
.
In
1965
,
Tyrrell
and
Bynoe
successfully
cultivated
the
novel
virus
by
serially
passing
it
through
organ
culture
of
human
embryonic
trachea
.
[
28
]
The
new
cultivating
method
was
introduced
to
the
lab
by
Bertil
Hoorn
.
[
29
]
The
isolated
virus
when
intranasally
inoculated
into
volunteers
caused
a
cold
and
was
inactivated
by
ether

.
They
isolated
and
grew
the
virus
in
kidney
tissue
culture
,
designating
it
229E
.
The
novel
virus
caused
a

Scottish
virologist
June

Hospital
in
London
,
collaborating
with
Tyrrell
,
compared
the
structures
of
IBV
,
B814
and
229E
in
1967
.
[
33
]
[
34

Using
electron
microscopy
the
three
viruses
were
shown
to
be
morphologically
related
by
their
general
shape
and
distinctive
club-like
spikes
.
[
35
]
A
research
group
at
the
National
Institute
of
Health
the
same
year
was
able
to
isolate
another
member
of
this
new
group
of
viruses
using
organ
culture
and
named
one
of
the
samples
OC43
(
OC
for

.
[
36

Like
B814
,
229E
,
and
IBV
,
the
novel
cold
virus
OC43
had
distinctive
club-like
spikes
when
observed
with
the
electron
microscope
.
[
37

The
IBV-like
novel
cold
viruses
were
soon
shown
to
be
also
morphologically
related
to
the
mouse
hepatitis
virus
.
[
20
]
This
new
group
of
viruses
were
named
coronaviruses
after
their
distinctive
morphological
appearance
.
[

]
Human
coronavirus
229E
and
human
coronavirus
OC43
continued
to
be
studied
in
subsequent
decades
.
[

]
The
coronavirus
strain
B814
was
lost
.
It
is
not
known
which
present
human
coronavirus
it
was
.
[
41
]
Other
human
coronaviruses
have
since
been
identified
,
including
SARS-CoV
in
2003
,
HCoV
NL63
in
2003
,
HCoV
HKU1
in
2004
,
MERS-CoV
in
2013
,
and
SARS-CoV-2
in
2019
.
[
42
]
There
have
also
been
a
large
number
of
animal
coronaviruses
identified
since
the
1960s
.
[
43
]
Coronaviruses
are
large
,
roughly
spherical
particles
with
unique
surface
projections
.
[
44
]
Their
size
is
highly
variable
with
average
diameters
of
80
to
120
nm
.
Extreme
sizes
are
known
from
50
to
200
nm
in
diameter
.
[
45
]
The
total
molecular
mass
is
on
average
40,000
kDa
.
They
are
enclosed
in
an
envelope
embedded
with
a
number
of
protein
molecules
.
[
46
]
The
lipid
bilayer
envelope
,
membrane
proteins
,
and
nucleocapsid
protect
the
virus
when
it
is
outside
the
host
cell
.
[
47
]
The
viral
envelope
is
made
up
of
a
lipid
bilayer
in
which
the
membrane
(
M
)
,
envelope
(
E
)
and
spike
(
S
)
structural
proteins
are
anchored
.
[
48
]
The
molar
ratio
of
E
:
S
:
M
in
the
lipid
bilayer
is
approximately
1:20:300
.
[
49
]
The
E
and
M
protein
are
the
structural
proteins
that
combined
with
the
lipid
bilayer
to
shape
the
viral
envelope
and
maintain
its
size
.
[
50
]
S
proteins
are
needed
for
interaction
with
the
host
cells
.
But
human
coronavirus
NL63
is
peculiar
in
that
its
M
protein
has
the
binding
site
for
the
host
cell
,
and
not
its
S
protein
.
[
51
]
The
diameter
of
the
envelope
is
85
nm
.
The
envelope
of
the
virus
in
electron
micrographs
appears
as
a
distinct
pair
of
electron-dense
shells
(
shells
that
are
relatively
opaque
to
the
electron
beam
used
to
scan
the
virus
particle
)
.
[
52
]
[
50
]
The
M
protein
is
the
main
structural
protein
of
the
envelope
that
provides
the
overall
shape
and
is
a
type
III
membrane
protein
.
It
consists
of
218
to
263
amino
acid
residues
and
forms
a
layer
7.8
nm
thick
.
[
46
]
It
has
three
domains
,
a
short
N-terminal
ectodomain
,
a
triple-spanning
transmembrane
domain
,
and
a
C-terminal
endodomain
.
The
C-terminal
domain
forms
a
matrix-like
lattice
that
adds
to
the
extra-thickness
of
the
envelope
.
Different
species
can
have
either
N-
or
O-linked
glycans
in
their
protein
amino-terminal
domain
.
The
M
protein
is
crucial
during
the
assembly
,
budding
,
envelope
formation
,
and
pathogenesis
stages
of
the
virus
lifecycle
.
[
53
]
The
E
proteins
are
minor
structural
proteins
and
highly
variable
in
different
species
.
[
45
]
There
are
only
about
20
copies
of
the
E
protein
molecule
in
a
coronavirus
particle
.
[
49
]
They
are
8.4
to
12
kDa
in
size
and
are
composed
of
76
to
109
amino
acids
.
[
45
]
They
are
integral
proteins
(
i.e
.
embedded
in
the
lipid
layer
)
and
have
two
domains
namely
a
transmembrane
domain
and
an
extramembrane
C-terminal
domain
.
They
are
almost
fully
α-helical
,
with
a
single
α-helical
transmembrane
domain
,
and
form
pentameric
(
five-molecular
)
ion
channels
in
the
lipid
bilayer
.
They
are
responsible
for
virion
assembly
,
intracellular
trafficking
and
morphogenesis
(
budding
)
.
[
46
]
The
spikes
are
the
most
distinguishing
feature
of
coronaviruses
and
are
responsible
for
the
corona-
or
halo-like
surface
.
On
average
a
coronavirus
particle
has
74
surface
spikes
.
[
54
]
Each
spike
is
about
20
nm
long
and
is
composed
of
a
trimer
of
the
S
protein
.
The
S
protein
is
in
turn
composed
of
an
S1
and
S2
subunit
.
The
homotrimeric
S
protein
is
a
class
I
fusion
protein
which
mediates
the
receptor
binding
and
membrane
fusion
between
the
virus
and
host
cell
.
The
S1
subunit
forms
the
head
of
the
spike
and
has
the
receptor-binding
domain
(
RBD
)
.
The
S2
subunit
forms
the
stem
which
anchors
the
spike
in
the
viral
envelope
and
on
protease
activation
enables
fusion
.
The
two
subunits
remain
noncovalently
linked
as
they
are
exposed
on
the
viral
surface
until
they
attach
to
the
host
cell
membrane
.
[
46
]
In
a
functionally
active
state
,
three
S1
are
attached
to
two
S2
subunits
.
The
subunit
complex
is
split
into
individual
subunits
when
the
virus
binds
and
fuses
with
the
host
cell
under
the
action
of
proteases
such
as
cathepsin
family
and
transmembrane
protease
serine
2
(
TMPRSS2
)
of
the
host
cell
.
[
55
]
S1
proteins
are
the
most
critical
components
in
terms
of
infection
.
They
are
also
the
most
variable
components
as
they
are
responsible
for
host
cell
specificity
.
They
possess
two
major
domains
named
N-terminal
domain
(
S1-NTD
)
and
C-terminal
domain
(
S1-CTD
)
,
both
of
which
serve
as
the
receptor-binding
domains
.
The
NTDs
recognize
and
bind
sugars
on
the
surface
of
the
host
cell
.
An
exception
is
the
MHV
NTD
that
binds
to
a
protein
receptor
carcinoembryonic
antigen-related
cell
adhesion
molecule
1
(
CEACAM1
)
.
S1-CTDs
are
responsible
for
recognizing
different
protein
receptors
such
as
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
2
(
ACE2
)
,
aminopeptidase
N
(
APN
)
,
and
dipeptidyl
peptidase
4
(
DPP4
)
.
[
46
]
A
subset
of
coronaviruses
(
specifically
the
members
of
betacoronavirus
subgroup
A
)
also
has
a
shorter
spike-like
surface
protein
called
hemagglutinin
esterase
(
HE
)
.
[
43
]
The
HE
proteins
occur
as
homodimers
composed
of
about
400
amino
acid
residues
and
are
40
to
50
kDa
in
size
.
They
appear
as
tiny
surface
projections
of
5
to
7
nm
long
embedded
in
between
the
spikes
.
They
help
in
the
attachment
to
and
detachment
from
the
host
cell
.
[
56
]
Inside
the
envelope
,
there
is
the
nucleocapsid
,
which
is
formed
from
multiple
copies
of
the
nucleocapsid
(
N
)
protein
,
which
are
bound
to
the
positive-sense
single-stranded
RNA
genome
in
a
continuous
beads-on-a-string
type
conformation
.
[
50

[
57
]
N
protein
is
a
phosphoprotein
of
43
to
50
kDa
in
size
,
and
is
divided
into
three
conserved
domains
.
The
majority
of
the
protein
is
made
up
of
domains
1
and
2
,
which
are
typically
rich
in
arginines
and
lysines
.
Domain
3
has
a
short
carboxy
terminal
end
and
has
a
net
negative
charge
due
to
excess
of
acidic
over
basic
amino
acid
residues
.

Coronaviruses
contain
a
positive-sense
,
single-stranded
RNA
genome
.
The
genome
size
for
coronaviruses
ranges
from
26.4
to
31.7
kilobases
.
[

The
genome
size

The
genome
has
a
5′
methylated
cap
and
a
3′
polyadenylated
tail
.
[
50
]
The
genome
organization
for
a
coronavirus
is
5′-leader-UTR-replicase
(
ORF1ab
)
-spike
(
S
)
-envelope
(
E
)
-membrane
(
M
)
-nucleocapsid
(
N
)
-3′UTR-poly
(
A
)
tail
.
The
open
reading
frames
1a
and
1b
,
which
occupy
the
first
two-thirds
of
the
genome
,
encode
the
replicase
polyprotein
(
pp1ab
)
.
The
replicase
polyprotein
self
cleaves
to
form
16
nonstructural
proteins
(
nsp1–nsp16
)
.
[
50
]
The
later
reading
frames
encode
the
four
major
structural
proteins
:
spike
,
envelope
,
membrane
,
and
nucleocapsid
.
[
58
]
Interspersed
between
these
reading
frames
are
the
reading
frames
for
the
accessory
proteins
.
The
number
of
accessory
proteins
and
their
function
is
unique
depending
on
the
specific
coronavirus
.
[
50
]
Infection
begins
when
the
viral
spike
protein
attaches
to
its
complementary
host
cell
receptor
.
After
attachment
,
a
protease
of
the
host
cell
cleaves
and
activates
the
receptor-attached
spike
protein
.
Depending
on
the
host
cell
protease
available
,
cleavage
and
activation
allows
the
virus
to
enter
the
host
cell
by
endocytosis
or
direct
fusion
of
the
viral
envelope
with
the
host
membrane
.
[
59
]
On
entry
into
the
host
cell
,
the
virus
particle
is
uncoated
,
and
its
genome
enters
the
cell
cytoplasm
.
The
coronavirus
RNA
genome
has
a
5′
methylated
cap
and
a
3′
polyadenylated
tail
,
which
allows
it
to
act
like
a
messenger
RNA
and
be
directly
translated
by
the
host
cell
's
ribosomes
.
The
host
ribosomes
translate
the
initial
overlapping
open
reading
frames
ORF1a
and
ORF1b
of
the
virus
genome
into
two
large
overlapping
polyproteins
,
pp1a
and
pp1ab
.
[
50
]
The
larger
polyprotein
pp1ab
is
a
result
of
a
-1
ribosomal
frameshift
caused
by
a
slippery
sequence
(
UUUAAAC
)
and
a
downstream
RNA
pseudoknot
at
the
end
of
open
reading
frame
ORF1a
.
[
60
]
The
ribosomal
frameshift
allows
for
the
continuous
translation
of
ORF1a
followed
by
ORF1b
.
[
50
]
The
polyproteins
have
their
own
proteases
,
PLpro
(
nsp3
)
and
3CLpro
(
nsp5
)
,
which
cleave
the
polyproteins
at
different
specific
sites
.
The
cleavage
of
polyprotein
pp1ab
yields
16
nonstructural
proteins
(
nsp1
to
nsp16
)
.
Product
proteins
include
various
replication
proteins
such
as
RNA-dependent
RNA
polymerase
(
nsp12
)
,
RNA
helicase
(
nsp13
)
,
and
exoribonuclease
(
nsp14
)
.
[
50
]
A
number
of
the
nonstructural
proteins
coalesce
to
form
a
multi-protein
replicase-transcriptase
complex
.
The
main
replicase-transcriptase
protein
is
the
RNA-dependent
RNA
polymerase
(
RdRp
)
.
It
is
directly
involved
in
the
replication
and
transcription
of
RNA
from
an
RNA
strand
.
The
other
nonstructural
proteins
in
the
complex
assist
in
the
replication
and
transcription
process
.
The
exoribonuclease
nonstructural
protein
,
for
instance
,
provides
extra
fidelity
to
replication
by
providing
a
proofreading
function
which
the
RNA-dependent
RNA
polymerase
lacks
.
[
61
]
Replication
–
One
of
the
main
functions
of
the
complex
is
to
replicate
the
viral
genome
.
RdRp
directly
mediates
the
synthesis
of
negative-sense
genomic
RNA
from
the
positive-sense
genomic
RNA
.
This
is
followed
by
the
replication
of
positive-sense
genomic
RNA
from
the
negative-sense
genomic
RNA
.
[
50
]
Transcription
–
The
other
important
function
of
the
complex
is
to
transcribe
the
viral
genome
.
RdRp
directly
mediates
the
synthesis
of
negative-sense
subgenomic
RNA
molecules
from
the
positive-sense
genomic
RNA
.
This
process
is
followed
by
the
transcription
of
these
negative-sense
subgenomic
RNA
molecules
to
their
corresponding
positive-sense
mRNAs
.
[
50
]
The
subgenomic
mRNAs
form
a
``
nested
set
''
which
have
a
common
5'-head
and
partially
duplicate
3'-end
.
[
62
]
Recombination
–
The
replicase-transcriptase
complex
is
also
capable
of
genetic
recombination
when
at
least
two
viral
genomes
are
present
in
the
same
infected
cell
.
[
62
]
RNA
recombination
appears
to
be
a
major
driving
force
in
determining
genetic
variability
within
a
coronavirus
species
,
the
capability
of
a
coronavirus
species
to
jump
from
one
host
to
another
and
,
infrequently
,
in
determining
the
emergence
of
novel
coronaviruses
.
[
63
]
The
exact
mechanism
of
recombination
in
coronaviruses
is
unclear
,
but
likely
involves
template
switching
during
genome
replication
.
[
63
]
The
replicated
positive-sense
genomic
RNA
becomes
the
genome
of
the
progeny
viruses
.
The
mRNAs
are
gene
transcripts
of
the
last
third
of
the
virus
genome
after
the
initial
overlapping
reading
frame
.
These
mRNAs
are
translated
by
the
host
's
ribosomes
into
the
structural
proteins
and
many
accessory
proteins
.
[
50
]
RNA
translation
occurs
inside
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
.
The
viral
structural
proteins
S
,
E
,
and
M
move
along
the
secretory
pathway
into
the
Golgi
intermediate
compartment
.
There
,
the
M
proteins
direct
most
protein-protein
interactions
required
for
the
assembly
of
viruses
following
its
binding
to
the
nucleocapsid
.
Progeny
viruses
are
then
released
from
the
host
cell
by
exocytosis
through
secretory
vesicles
.
Once
released
the
viruses
can
infect
other
host
cells
.
[
64
]
Infected
carriers
are
able
to
shed
viruses
into
the
environment
.
The
interaction
of
the
coronavirus
spike
protein
with
its
complementary
cell
receptor
is
central
in
determining
the
tissue
tropism
,
infectivity
,
and
species
range
of
the
released
virus
.

on
the
coronavirus
species
,
by
either
an
aerosol
,

which
is
one
of

They
are
divided
into
the
four
genera
:
Alphacoronavirus

The

ancestor
(

)
of
all
coronaviruses
is
estimated
to
have
existed
as
recently
as
8000
BCE
,
although
some
models
place
the
common
ancestor
as
far
back
as
55
million
years
or
more
,
implying
long
term
coevolution
with
bat

The
most
recent

of
the
alphacoronavirus

has
been
placed
at
about
2400
BCE
,
of
the
betacoronavirus

,
of
the
gammacoronavirus

.
The
large
number
and
global
range
of
bat

enabled
extensive
evolution

Many
human
coronaviruses

have
been
caused

,
there
have
been
at

confirmed
deaths
and
more
than
181,179,712
[

in
the
COVID-19
pandemic
.
The
Wuhan
strain
has
been
identified
as
a
new
strain
of
Betacoronavirus
from
group
2B
with
approximately
70
%
genetic
similarity
to
the
SARS-CoV
.
[
125
]
The
virus
has
a
96
%
similarity
to
a
bat
coronavirus
,
so
it
is
widely
suspected
to
originate
from
bats
as
well
.

During
a
surveillance
study
of
archived
samples
of
Malaysian
viral
pneumonia
patients
,
virologists
identified
a
strain
of
canine
coronavirus
which
has
infected
humans
in
2018
.
Coronaviruses
have
been
recognized
as
causing
pathological
conditions
in
veterinary
medicine
since
the
1930s
.
[

]
They
infect
a
range
of
animals
including
swine
,
cattle
,
horses
,
camels
,
cats
,
dogs
,
rodents
,
birds
and
bats
.
[

The
majority
of
animal
related
coronaviruses
infect
the
intestinal
tract
and
are
transmitted
by
a
fecal-oral
route
.
[
129
]
Significant
research
efforts
have
been
focused
on
elucidating
the
viral
pathogenesis
of
these
animal
coronaviruses
,
especially
by
virologists
interested
in
veterinary
and
zoonotic
diseases
.

Infectious
bronchitis
virus
(
IBV
)
,
a
type
of
coronavirus
,
causes
avian
infectious
bronchitis
.
[
132
]
The
virus
is
of
concern
to
the
poultry
industry
because
of
the
high
mortality
from
infection
,
its
rapid
spread
,
and
its
effect
on
production
.
[
128
]
The
virus
affects
both
meat
production
and
egg
production
and
causes
substantial
economic
loss
.
[
133
]
In
chickens
,
infectious
bronchitis
virus
targets
not
only
the
respiratory
tract
but
also
the
urogenital
tract
.
The
virus
can
spread
to
different
organs
throughout
the
chicken
.
[
132
]
The
virus
is
transmitted
by
aerosol
and
food
contaminated
by
feces
.
Different
vaccines
against
IBV
exist
and
have
helped
to
limit
the
spread
of
the
virus
and
its
variants
.
[

Infectious
bronchitis
virus
is
one
of
a

Another
strain
of
avian
coronavirus
is
turkey
coronavirus
(
TCV
)
which
causes
enteritis
in
turkeys
.
[

There
are
two
different
coronaviruses
that
infect
dogs

)
,
which
is
a
member
of
the

Similarly
,
there
are
two
types
of
coronavirus
that
infect
ferrets
.
[

Ferret
enteric
coronavirus
causes
a
gastrointestinal
syndrome
known
as
epizootic
catarrhal
enteritis
(
ECE
)
,
and
a
more
lethal
systemic
version
of
the
virus
(
like
FIP
in
cats
)
known
as
ferret
systemic
coronavirus
(
FSC

Mouse
hepatitis
virus
(
MHV
)
,
which
is
a
member
of
the
species
Murine
coronavirus
,
[
144
]
causes
an
epidemic
murine
illness
with
high
mortality
,
especially
among
colonies
of
laboratory

.
[
145

Prior
to
the
discovery
of
SARS-CoV
,
MHV
was
the
best-studied
coronavirus
both
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
as
well
as
at
the
molecular
level
.
Some
strains
of
MHV
cause
a
progressive
demyelinating
encephalitis
in
mice
which
has
been
used
as
a
murine
model
for
multiple

Sialodacryoadenitis
virus
(
SDAV
)
,
which
is
a
strain
of
the
species
Murine
coronavirus
,
[
144
]
is
highly
infectious
coronavirus
of
laboratory
rats
,
which
can
be
transmitted
between
individuals
by
direct

and
indirectly
by
aerosol
.
Rabbit
enteric
coronavirus
causes
acute
gastrointestinal
disease
and
diarrhea
in

A
number
of
vaccines
using
different
methods
have
been
developed
against
human
coronavirus
SARS-CoV-2
.
[

Antiviral
targets
against
human
coronaviruses
have
also
been
identified
such
as
viral
proteases
,
polymerases

Vaccines
are
available
for
animal
coronaviruses
IBV
,
TGEV
,
and

,
although
their
effectiveness
is
limited
.
In
the
case
of
outbreaks
of
highly
contagious
animal
coronaviruses
,
such
as
PEDV

Coronavirus
disease
2019
(
COVID-19
)
is
a
contagious
disease
caused
by
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
2
(
SARS-CoV-2
)
.
The
first
known
case
was
identified
in
Wuhan
,
China
in
December
2019
.
[
7
]
The
disease
has
since
spread
worldwide
,
leading
to
an
ongoing
pandemic
.
[
8
]
Symptoms
of
COVID-19
are
variable
,
but
often
include
fever
,
[
9
]
cough
,
headache
,
[
10
]
fatigue
,
breathing
difficulties
,
and
loss
of
smell
and
taste
.
[
11
]
[
12
]
[
13
]
Symptoms
may
begin
one
to
fourteen
days
after
exposure
to
the
virus
.
At
least
a
third
of
people
who
are
infected
do
not
develop
noticeable
symptoms
.
[
14
]
Of
those
people
who
develop
noticeable
symptoms
enough
to
be
classed
as
patients
,
most
(
81
%
)
develop
mild
to
moderate
symptoms
(
up
to
mild
pneumonia
)
,
while
14
%
develop
severe
symptoms
(
dyspnea
,
hypoxia
,
or
more
than
50
%
lung
involvement
on
imaging
)
,
and
5
%
suffer
critical
symptoms
(
respiratory
failure
,
shock
,
or
multiorgan
dysfunction
)
.
[
15
]
Older
people
are
at
a
higher
risk
of
developing
severe
symptoms
.
Some
people
continue
to
experience
a
range
of
effects
(
long
COVID
)
for
months
after
recovery
,
and
damage
to
organs
has
been
observed
.
[
16
]
Multi-year
studies
are
underway
to
further
investigate
the
long-term
effects
of
the
disease
.
[
16
]
Transmission
of
COVID-19
occurs
when
people
are
exposed
to
virus-containing
respiratory
droplets
and
airborne
particles
exhaled
by
an
infected
person
.
[
17
]
[
18
]
Those
particles
may
be
inhaled
or
may
reach
the
mouth
,
nose
,
or
eyes
of
a
person
through
touching
or
direct
deposition
(
i.e
.
being
coughed
on
)
.
[
17
]
The
risk
of
infection
is
highest
when
people
are
in
close
proximity
for
a
long
time
,
but
particles
can
be
inhaled
over
longer
distances
,
particularly
indoors
in
poorly
ventilated
and
crowded
spaces
.
[
17
]
[
19
]
In
those
conditions
small
particles
can
remain
suspended
in
the
air
for
minutes
to
hours
.
[
17
]
Touching
a
contaminated
surface
or
object
may
lead
to
infection
although
this
does
not
contribute
substantially
to
transmission
.
[
17
]
[
20
]
People
who
are
infected
can
transmit
the
virus
to
another
person
up
to
two
days
before
they
themselves
show
symptoms
,
as
can
people
who
do
not
experience
symptoms
.
[
21
]
[
22
]
People
remain
infectious
for
up
to
ten
days
after
the
onset
of
symptoms
in
moderate
cases
and
up
to
twenty
days
in
severe
cases
.
[
23
]
Several
testing
methods
have
been
developed
to
diagnose
the
disease
.
The
standard
diagnostic
method
is
by
detection
of
the
virus
'
nucleic
acid
by
real-time
reverse
transcription
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
rRT-PCR
)
,
transcription-mediated
amplification
(
TMA
)
,
or
by
reverse
transcription
loop-mediated
isothermal
amplification
(
RT-LAMP
)
from
a
nasopharyngeal
swab
.
Preventive
measures
include
physical
or
social
distancing
,
quarantining
,
ventilation
of
indoor
spaces
,
covering
coughs
and
sneezes
,
hand
washing
,
and
keeping
unwashed
hands
away
from
the
face
.
The
use
of
face
masks
or
coverings
has
been
recommended
in
public
settings
to
minimize
the
risk
of
transmissions
.
While
work
is
underway
to
develop
drugs
that
inhibit
the
virus
(
and
several
vaccines
for
it
have
been
approved
and
distributed
in
various
countries
,
which
have
since
initiated
mass
vaccination
campaigns
)
,
the
primary
treatment
is
symptomatic
.
Management
involves
the
treatment
of
symptoms
,
supportive
care
,
isolation
,
and
experimental
measures
.
During
the
initial
outbreak

.
[

a
third
of
the
people
who
are

with
the
virus
do
not
develop
noticeable
symptoms
at
any
point
in
time
.
[

These
asymptomatic
carriers
tend
not
to
get
tested
and
can
spread
the
disease
.
[
50

[
51

Other
infected
people
will
develop
symptoms
later
,
called
``
pre-symptomatic
''
,

have
very
mild
symptoms
and
can
also
spread
the
virus
.
[

As
is
common
with
infections
,
there
is
a
delay
between
the
moment
a
person
first
becomes
infected
and
the
appearance
of
the
first
symptoms
.
The
median
delay
for
COVID-19
is
four
to
five
days
.
[
54
]
Most
symptomatic
people
experience
symptoms
within
two
to
seven
days
after
exposure
,
and
almost
all
will
experience
at
least
one
symptom

The
disease
is
mainly
transmitted
via
the
respiratory
route
when
people
inhale
droplets
and
particles
that
infected
people
release
as
they
breathe
,
talk
,
cough
,
sneeze
,
or
sing

the
when
they
are
physically
close
.
However
,
infection
can
occur
over
longer
distances
,
particularly
indoors
.
[
57

Infectivity
begins
as
early
as
three
days
before
symptoms
appear
,
and
people
are
most
infectious
just
prior
to
and
during
the
onset
of

It
declines
after
the
first
week
,
but
infected
people
remain
contagious
for
up
to
20

the
disease
even
if
they
are
asymptomatic

It
is
thought
to
have
an
animal

revealed
that
the
coronavirus
genetically
clusters
with
the
genus
Betacoronavirus
,
in
subgenus
Sarbecovirus
(
lineage
B
)
together
with
two
bat-derived
strains

It
is
96

identical
at

,
nucleocapsid
protein
(

,
and
the

protein
of
SARS-CoV-2
is
about

suggest
the
UK
variant
VUI-202012/01
(
the
first

in
the

COVID-19
can
affect
the
upper
respiratory
tract
(
sinuses
,
nose
,
and
throat
)
and
the
lower
respiratory
tract
(
windpipe
and
lungs
)
.
[
81
]
The
lungs
are
the
organs
most
affected
by
COVID-19
because
the
virus
accesses
host
cells
via
the
receptor
for
the
enzyme
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
2
(
ACE2
)
,
which
is
most
abundant
on
the
surface
of
type
II
alveolar
cells
of
the
lungs
.
[
82
]
The
virus
uses
a
special
surface
glycoprotein
called
a
``
spike
''
(
peplomer
)
to
connect
to
the
ACE2
receptor
and
enter
the
host
cell
.
[

Whether
SARS-CoV-2
is
able
to
invade
the
nervous
system
remains
unknown
however
it
is
clear
that
many
people
with
COVID-19
exhibit
neurological
or
mental
health
issues
.
The
virus
is
not
detected
in
the
CNS
of
the
majority
of
COVID-19
people
with
neurological
issues
.
However
,
SARS-CoV-2
has
been
detected
at
low
levels
in
the
brains
of
those
who
have
died
from
COVID-19
,
but
these
results
need
to
be
confirmed
.

Loss
of
smell
results
from
infection
of
the
support
cells
of
the
olfactory
epithelium
,
with
subsequent
damage
to
the
olfactory
neurons
.
[
85
]
SARS-CoV-2
could
cause
respiratory
failure
through
affecting
the
brain
stem
as
other
coronaviruses
have
been
found
to
invade
the
CNS
.
While
virus
has
been
detected
in
cerebrospinal
fluid
of
autopsies
,
the
exact
mechanism
by
which
it
invades
the
CNS
remains
unclear
and
may
first
involve
invasion
of
peripheral
nerves
given
the
low
levels
of
ACE2
in
the
brain
.
[
86
]
[
87
]
[
88
]
The
virus
may
also
enter
the
bloodstream
from
the
lungs
and
cross
the
blood-brain
barrier
to
gain
access
to
the
CNS
,
possibly
within
an
infected
white
blood
cell
.
[
84
]
The
virus
also
affects
gastrointestinal
organs
as
ACE2
is
abundantly
expressed
in
the
glandular
cells
of
gastric
,
duodenal
and
rectal
epithelium
[
89
]
as
well
as
endothelial
cells
and
enterocytes
of
the
small
intestine
.
[
90
]
The
virus
can
cause
acute
myocardial
injury
and
chronic
damage
to
the
cardiovascular
system
.
[
91
]
An
acute
cardiac
injury
was
found
in
12
%
of
infected
people
admitted
to
the
hospital
in
Wuhan
,
China
,
[
92
]
and
is
more
frequent
in
severe
disease
.
[
93
]
Rates
of
cardiovascular
symptoms
are
high
,
owing
to
the
systemic
inflammatory
response
and
immune
system
disorders
during
disease
progression
,
but
acute
myocardial
injuries
may
also
be
related
to
ACE2
receptors
in
the
heart
.
[
91
]
ACE2
receptors
are
highly
expressed
in
the
heart
and
are
involved
in
heart
function
.

Blood
vessel
dysfunction
and
clot
formation
(
as
suggested
by
high
D-dimer
levels
caused
by
blood
clots
)
are
thought
to
play
a
significant
role
in
mortality
,
incidences
of
clots
leading
to
pulmonary
embolisms
,
and
ischaemic
events
within
the
brain
have
been
noted
as
complications
leading
to
death
in
people
infected
with
SARS-CoV-2
.
Infection
appears
to
set
off
a
chain
of
vasoconstrictive
responses
within
the
body
,
constriction
of
blood
vessels
within
the
pulmonary
circulation
has
also
been
posited
as
a
mechanism
in
which
oxygenation
decreases
alongside
the
presentation
of
viral
pneumonia
.
[

Furthermore
,
microvascular
blood
vessel
damage
has
been
reported
in
a
small
number
of
tissue
samples
of
the
brains
–
without

SARS-CoV-2
–
and
the

from
those
who
have
died
from
COVID-19
.
[

[

[

Another
common
cause
of
death
is
complications
related
to
the
kidneys
.
[

Early
reports
show
that
up
to
30
%
of
hospitalized
patients
both
in
China
and
in
New
York
have
experienced
some
injury
to
their
kidneys
,
including
some
persons
with
no
previous
kidney
problems
.
[

Autopsies
of
people
who
died
of
COVID-19
have
found
diffuse
alveolar
damage
,
and
lymphocyte-containing
inflammatory
infiltrates
within
the
lung
.
[

Although
SARS-CoV-2
has
a
tropism
for
ACE2-expressing
epithelial
cells
of
the
respiratory
tract
,
people
with
severe
COVID-19
have
symptoms
of
systemic
hyperinflammation
.

Additionally
,
people

Systemic
inflammation
results
in
vasodilation
,
allowing
inflammatory
lymphocytic
and
monocytic
infiltration
of
the
lung
and
the
heart
.
In
particular
,
pathogenic
GM-CSF-secreting
T
cells
were
shown
to
correlate
with
the
recruitment
of
inflammatory
IL-6-secreting
monocytes
and
severe
lung
pathology
in
people
with
COVID-19
.
[

Lymphocytic
infiltrates
have
also
been
reported
at
autopsy

[

Multiple
viral
and
host
factors
affect
the
pathogenesis
of
the
virus
.
The
S-protein
,
otherwise
known
as
the
spike
protein
,
is
the
viral
component
that
attaches
to
the
host
receptor
via
the
ACE2
receptors
.
It
includes
two
subunits
:
S1
and
S2
.
S1
determines
the
virus-host
range
and
cellular
tropism
via
the
receptor-binding
domain
.
S2
mediates
the
membrane
fusion
of
the
virus
to
its
potential
cell
host
via
the
H1
and
HR2
,
which
are
heptad
repeat
regions
.
Studies
have
shown
that
S1
domain
induced
IgG
and
IgA
antibody
levels
at
a
much
higher
capacity
.
It
is
the
focus
spike
proteins
expression
that
are
involved
in
many
effective
COVID-19
vaccines
.
[
104
]
The
M
protein
is
the
viral
protein
responsible
for
the
transmembrane
transport
of
nutrients
.
It
is
the
cause
of
the
bud
release
and
the
formation
of
the
viral
envelope
.
[
105
]
The
N
and
E
protein
are
accessory
proteins
that
interfere
with
the
host
's
immune
response
.
[

Human
angiotensin
converting
enzyme
2
(
hACE2
)
is
the
host
factor
that
SARS-COV2
virus
targets
causing
COVID-19
.
Theoretically
the
usage
of
angiotensin
receptor
blockers
(
ARB
)
and
ACE
inhibitors
upregulating
ACE2
expression
might
increase
morbidity
with
COVID-19
,
though
animal
data
suggest
some
potential
protective
effect
of
ARB
.
However
no
clinical
studies
have
proven
susceptibility
or
outcomes
.
Until
further
data
is
available
,
guidelines
and
recommendations
for
hypertensive
patients
remain
.
[
106
]
The
effect
of
the
virus
on
ACE2
cell
surfaces
leads
to
leukocytic
infiltration
,
increased
blood
vessel
permeability
,
alveolar
wall
permeability
,
as
well
as
decreased
secretion
of
lung
surfactants
.
These
effects
cause
the
majority
of
the
respiratory
symptoms
.
However
,
the
aggravation
of
local
inflammation
causes
a
cytokine
storm
eventually
leading
to
a
systemic
inflammatory
response
syndrome
.
[
107
]
Among
healthy
adults
not
exposed
to
SARS-CoV-2
,
about
35
%
have
CD4+
T
cells
that
recognize
the
SARS-CoV-2
S
protein
(
particularly
the
S2
subunit
)
and
about
50
%
react
to
other
proteins
of
the
virus
,
suggesting
cross-reactivity
from
previous
common
colds
caused
by
other
coronaviruses
.
[
108
]
The
severity
of
the
inflammation
can
be
attributed
to
the
severity
of
what
is
known
as
the
cytokine
storm
.
[
109
]
Levels
of
interleukin
1B
,
interferon-gamma
,
interferon-inducible
protein
10
,
and
monocyte
chemoattractant
protein
1
were
all
associated
with
COVID-19
disease
severity
.
Treatment
has
been
proposed
to
combat
the
cytokine
storm
as
it
remains
to
be
one
of
the
leading
causes
of
morbidity
and
mortality
in
COVID-19
disease
.
[
110

A
cytokine
storm
is
due
to
an
acute
hyperinflammatory
response
that
is
responsible
for
clinical
illness
in
an
array
of
diseases
but
in
COVID-19
,
it
is
related
to
worse
prognosis
and
increased
fatality
.
The
storm
causes
acute
respiratory
distress
syndrome
,
blood
clotting
events
such
as
strokes
,
myocardial
infarction
,
encephalitis
,
acute
kidney
injury
,
and
vasculitis
.
The
production
of
IL-1
,
IL-2
,
IL-6
,
TNF-alpha
,
and
interferon-gamma
,
all
crucial
components
of
normal
immune
responses
,
inadvertently
become
the
causes
of
a
cytokine
storm
.
The
cells
of
the
central
nervous
system
,
the
microglia
,
neurons
,
and
astrocytes
,
are
also
involved
in
the
release
of
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
affecting
the
nervous

,
and
effects
of
cytokine
storms
toward
the
CNS
are
not
uncommon

Pregnancy
response
Nowadays
,
there
are
many
unknowns
for
pregnant
women
during
the
COVID-19
pandemic
.
Given
that
they
are
prone
to
suffering
from
complications
and
severe
disease
infection
with
other
types
of
coronaviruses
,
they
have
been
identified
as
a
vulnerable
group
and
advised
to
take
supplementary
preventive
measures
.
[

Physiological
responses
to
pregnancy
can
include
:
However
,
from
the
evidence
base
,
it
is
difficult
to
conclude
whether
pregnant
women
are
at
increased
risk
of
grave
consequences
of
this
virus
.
[
112

In
addition
to
the
above
,
other
clinical
studies
have
proved
that
SARS-CoV-2
can
affect
the
period
of
pregnancy
in
different
ways
.
On
the
one
hand
,
there
is
little
evidence
of
its
impact
up
to
12
weeks
gestation
.
On
the
other
hand
,
COVID-19
infection
may
cause
increased
rates
of
unfavorable
outcomes
in
the
course
of
the
pregnancy
.
Some
examples
of
these
could
be
fetal
growth
restriction
,
preterm
birth
,
and
perinatal
mortality
,
which
refers
to
the
fetal
death
past

,
the
virus
that

,
and
death
caused
by

an
established
body
of
knowledge
existed
about
the

causing
diseases
like
severe
acute
respiratory

The
WHO
and
the
US
CDC
recommend
individuals
wear
non-medical
face
coverings
in
public
settings
where
there
is
an
increased
risk
of
transmission
and
where
social
distancing
measures
are
difficult
to
maintain
.
[
162
]
[
163
]
This
recommendation
is
meant
to
reduce
the
spread
of
the
disease
by
asymptomatic
and
pre-symptomatic
individuals
and
is
complementary
to
established
preventive
measures
such
as
social
distancing
.
[
163
]
[
164
]
Face
coverings
limit
the
volume
and
travel
distance
of
expiratory
droplets
dispersed
when
talking
,
breathing
,
and
coughing
.
[
163
]
[
164
]
A
face
covering
without
vents
or
holes
will
also
filter
out
particles
containing
the
virus
from
inhaled
and
exhaled
air
,
reducing
the
chances
of
infection
.
[
165
]
But
,
if
the
mask
include
an
exhalation
valve
,
a
wearer
that
is
infected
(
maybe
without
having
noticed
that
,
and
asymptomatic
)
would
transmit
the
virus
outwards
through
it
,
despite
any
certification
they
can
have
.
So
the
masks
with
exhalation
valve
are
not
for
the
infected
wearers
,
and
are
not
reliable
to
stop
the
pandemic
in
a
large
scale
.
Many
countries
and
local
jurisdictions
encourage
or
mandate
the
use
of
face
masks
or
cloth
face
coverings
by
members
of
the
public
to
limit
the
spread
of
the
virus
.
[
166
]
Masks
are
also
strongly
recommended
for
those
who
may
have
been
infected
and
those
taking
care
of
someone
who
may
have
the
disease
.
[
167
]
When
not
wearing
a
mask
,
the
CDC
recommends
covering
the
mouth
and
nose
with
a
tissue
when
coughing
or
sneezing
and
recommends
using
the
inside
of
the
elbow
if
no
tissue
is
available
.
Proper
hand
hygiene
after
any
cough
or
sneeze
is
encouraged
.
Healthcare
professionals
interacting
directly
with
people
who
have
COVID-19
are
advised
to
use
respirators
at
least
as
protective
as
NIOSH-certified
N95
or
equivalent
,
in
addition
to
other
personal
protective
equipment
.
[
168

The
CDC
recommends
that
crowded
indoor
spaces
should
be
avoided
.
[
17
]
When
indoors
,
increasing
the
rate
of
air
change
,
decreasing
recirculation
of
air
and
increasing
the
use
of
outdoor
air
can
reduce
transmission
.
[

[

The
WHO
recommends
ventilation
and
air
filtration
in
public
spaces
to
help
clear
out
infectious
aerosols
.
[
169
]
[
170
]
[
171
]
Exhaled
respiratory
particles
can
build-up
within
enclosed
spaces
with
inadequate
ventilation
.
The
risk
of
COVID-19
infection
increases
especially
in
spaces
where
people
engage
in
physical
exertion
or
raise
their
voice
(
e.g.
,
exercising
,
shouting
,
singing
)
as
this
increases
exhalation
of
respiratory
droplets
.
Prolonged
exposure
to
these
conditions
,
typically
more
than
15
minutes
,
leads
to
higher
risk
of
infection
.
[
17
]
Thorough
hand
hygiene
after
any
cough
or
sneeze
is
required
.
[
172
]
The
WHO
also
recommends
that
individuals
wash
hands
often
with
soap
and
water
for
at
least
twenty
seconds
,
especially
after
going
to
the
toilet
or
when
hands
are
visibly
dirty
,
before
eating
and
after
blowing
one
's
nose
.
[
173
]
When
soap
and
water
are
not
available
,
the
CDC
recommends
using
an
alcohol-based
hand
sanitiser
with
at
least
60
%
alcohol
.
[
174
]
For
areas
where
commercial
hand
sanitisers
are
not
readily
available
,
the
WHO
provides
two
formulations
for
local
production
.
In
these
formulations
,
the
antimicrobial
activity
arises
from
ethanol
or
isopropanol
.
Hydrogen
peroxide
is
used
to
help
eliminate
bacterial
spores
in
the
alcohol
;
it
is
``
not
an
active
substance
for
hand
antisepsis
.
''
Glycerol
is
added
as
a
humectant
.
[

Social
distancing
(
also
known
as
physical
distancing
)
includes
infection
control
actions
intended
to
slow
the
spread
of
the
disease
by
minimising
close
contact
between
individuals
.
Methods
include
quarantines
;
travel
restrictions
;
and
the
closing
of
schools
,
workplaces
,
stadiums
,
theatres
,
or
shopping
centres
.
Individuals
may
apply
social
distancing
methods
by
staying
at
home
,
limiting
travel
,
avoiding
crowded
areas
,
using
no-contact
greetings
,
and
physically
distancing
themselves
from
others

Many
governments
are
now
mandating
or
recommending
social
distancing
in
regions
affected
by
the
outbreak
.
[
176
]
Outbreaks
have
occurred
in
prisons
due
to
crowding
and
an
inability
to
enforce
adequate
social
distancing

In
the
United
States
,
the
prisoner
population
is
aging
and
many
of
them
are
at
high
risk
for
poor
outcomes
from
COVID-19
due
to
high
rates
of
coexisting
heart
and
lung
disease
,
and
poor
access
to
high-quality
healthcare
.
[

After
being
expelled
from
the
body
,
coronaviruses
can
survive
on
surfaces
for
hours
to
days
.
If
a
person
touches
the
dirty
surface
,
they
may
deposit
the
virus
at
the
eyes
,
nose
,
or
mouth
where
it
can
enter
the
body
and
cause
infection
.
[
179
]
Evidence
indicates
that
contact
with
infected
surfaces
is
not
the
main
driver
of
COVID-19
,
[
180
]
[
181
]
[
182
]
leading
to
recommendations
for
optimised
disinfection
procedures
to
avoid
issues
such
as
the
increase
of
antimicrobial
resistance
through
the
use
of
inappropriate
cleaning
products
and
processes
.
[

Deep
cleaning
and
other
surface
sanitation
has
been
criticized
as
hygiene
theater
,
giving
a
false
sense
of
security
against
something
primarily
spread
through
the
air
.
[
185
]
[
186
]
The
amount
of
time
that
the
virus
can
survive
depends
significantly
on
the
type
of
surface
,
the
temperature
,
and
the
humidity
.
[

Coronaviruses
die
very
quickly
when
exposed
to
the
UV
light
in
sunlight
.
[
187
]
Like
other
enveloped
viruses
,
SARS-CoV-2
survives
longest
when
the
temperature
is
at
room
temperature
or
lower
,
and
when
the
relative
humidity
is
low
(
<
50
%
)
.
[

On
many
surfaces
,
including
as
glass
,
some
types
of
plastic
,
stainless
steel
,
and
skin
,
the
virus
can
remain
infective
for
several
days
indoors
at
room
temperature
,
or
even
about
a
week
under
ideal
conditions
.
[
187
]
[
188
]
On
some
surfaces
,
including
cotton
fabric
and
copper
,
the
virus
usually
dies
after
a
few
hours
.
[
187
]
The
virus
dies
faster
on
porous
surfaces
than
on
non-porous
surfaces
due
to
capillary
action
within
pores
and
faster
aerosol
droplet
evaporation
.
[
189
]
[
182
]
[
187
]
However
,
of
the
many
surfaces
tested
,
two
with
the
longest
survival
times
are
N95
respirator
masks
and
surgical
masks
,
both
of
which
are
considered
porous
surfaces
.
[
187
]
The
CDC
says
that
in
most
situations
,
cleaning
surfaces
with
soap
or
detergent
,
not
disinfecting
,
is
enough
to
reduce
risk
of
transmission
.
[

The
CDC
recommends
that
if
a
COVID-19
case
is
suspected
or
confirmed
at
a
facility
such
as
an
office
or
day
care
,
all

shared
electronic
equipment
like
tablets
,
touch
screens

keyboards
,
remote
controls
,
and
ATM
machines
used
by
the
ill
persons
should
be
disinfected
.

Surfaces
may
be
decontaminated

0.1
percent
sodium

The
immune
response
by
humans
to
CoV-2
virus
occurs
as
a
combination
of
the
cell-mediated
immunity
and
antibody
production
,
[

just
as
with
most
other
infections

Since

it
remains
unknown
if
the
immunity

long-lasting
in
people
who
recover
from
the
disease
.
[

The
presence
of
neutralizing
antibodies
in
blood
strongly
correlates
with
protection
from
infection
,
but
the
level
of
neutralizing
antibody
declines
with
time
.
Those
with
asymptomatic
or
mild
disease
had
undetectable
levels
of
neutralizing
antibody
two
months

In
another
study
,
the
level
of
neutralizing
antibodies
fell
four-fold
one
to
four
months
after
the
onset
of
symptoms
.
However
,
the
lack
of
antibodies
in
the
blood
does
not
mean
antibodies
will
not
be
rapidly
produced
upon
reexposure
to
SARS-CoV-2
.
Memory
B
cells
specific
for
the
spike
and
nucleocapsid
proteins
of

[

Nevertheless
,
15
cases
of
reinfection
with
SARS-CoV-2
have
been
reported
using
stringent
CDC
criteria
requiring
identification
of
a
different
variant
from
the
second
infection
.
There
are
likely
to
be
many
more
people
who
have
been
reinfected
with
the
virus
.
Herd
immunity
will
not
eliminate
the
virus
if
reinfection
is
common
.
[

Some
other

Several
measures
are
commonly
used
to
quantify
mortality
.
[
279
]
These
numbers
vary
by
region
and
over
time
and
are
influenced
by
the
volume
of
testing
,
healthcare
system
quality
,
treatment
options
,
time
since
the
initial
outbreak
,
and
population
characteristics
such
as
age
,
sex
,
and
overall
health
.
[
280
]
The
mortality
rate
reflects
the
number
of
deaths
within
a
specific
demographic
group
divided
by
the
population
of
that
demographic
group
.
Consequently
,
the
mortality
rate
reflects
the
prevalence
as
well
as
the
severity
of
the
disease
within
a
given
population
.
Mortality
rates
are
highly
correlated
to
age
,
with
relatively
low
rates
for
young
people
and
relatively
high
rates
among
the
elderly
.
[
281
]
[
282
]
[
283
]
In
fact
,
one
relevant
factor
of
mortality
rates
is
the
age
structure
of
the
countries
’
populations
.
For
example
,
the
case
fatality
rate
for
COVID-19
is
lower
in
India
than
in
the
US
since
India
's
younger
population
represents
a
larger
percentage
than
in
the
US
.
[

The
case
fatality
rate
(
CFR
)
reflects
the
number
of
deaths
divided
by
the
number
of
diagnosed
cases
within
a
given
time
interval
.
Based
on
Johns
Hopkins
University
statistics
,
the
global
death-to-case
ratio
is
2.2
%
(
3,925,009/181,179,712
)
as
of
28
June

The
number

The
CFR
may
not
reflect
the
true
severity
of
the
disease
,
because
some
infected
individuals
remain
asymptomatic
or
experience
only
mild
symptoms
,
and
hence
such
infections
may
not
be
included
in
official
case
reports
.
Moreover
,
the
CFR
may
vary
markedly
over
time
and
across
locations
due
to
the
availability
of
live
virus
tests
.

A
key
metric
in
gauging
the
severity
of
COVID-19
is
the
infection
fatality
rate
(
IFR
)
,
also
referred
to
as
the
infection
fatality
ratio
or
infection
fatality
risk
.
[
289
]
[
290
]
[
291
]
This
metric
is
calculated
by
dividing
the
total
number
of
deaths
from
the
disease
by
the
total
number
of
infected
individuals
;
hence
,
in
contrast
to
the
CFR
,
the
IFR
incorporates
asymptomatic
and
undiagnosed
infections
as
well
as
reported
cases
.
[
292
]
A
December
2020
systematic
review
and
meta-analysis
estimated
that
population
IFR
during
the
first
wave
of
the
pandemic
was
about
0.5
%
to
1
%
in
many
locations
(
including
France
,
Netherlands
,
New
Zealand
,
and
Portugal
)
,
1
%
to
2
%
in
other
locations
(
Australia
,
England
,
Lithuania
,
and
Spain
)
,
and
exceeded
2
%
in
Italy
.
[
293
]
That
study
also
found
that
most
of
these
differences
in
IFR
reflected
corresponding
differences
in
the
age
composition
of
the
population
and
age-specific
infection
rates
;
in
particular
,
the
metaregression
estimate
of
IFR
is
very
low
for
children
and
younger
adults
(
e.g.
,
0.002
%
at
age
10
and
0.01
%
at
age
25
)
but
increases
progressively
to
0.4
%
at
age
55
,
1.4
%
at
age
65
,
4.6
%
at
age
75
,
and
15
%
at
age
85
.
[

These
results
were
also
highlighted
in
a
December
2020
report
issued
by
the
WHO
.
[
294
]
An
analysis
of
those
IFR
rates
indicates
that
COVID-19
is
hazardous
not
only
for
the
elderly
but
also
for
middle-aged
adults
,
for
whom
a
fatal
COVID-19
infection
is
two
orders
of
magnitude
more
likely
than
the
annualized
risk
of
a
fatal
automobile
accident
and
far
more
dangerous
than
seasonal
influenza
.
[
293
]
At
an
early
stage
of
the
pandemic
,
the
World
Health
Organization
reported
estimates
of
IFR
between
0.3
%
and
1
%
.
[
295
]
[
296
]
On
2
July
,
The
WHO
's
chief
scientist
reported
that
the
average
IFR
estimate
presented
at
a
two-day
WHO
expert
forum
was
about
0.6
%
.
[
297
]
[
298
]
In
August
,
the
WHO
found
that
studies
incorporating
data
from
broad
serology
testing
in
Europe
showed
IFR
estimates
converging
at
approximately
0.5–1
%
.
[
299
]
Firm
lower
limits
of
IFRs
have
been
established
in
a
number
of
locations
such
as
New
York
City
and
Bergamo
in
Italy
since
the
IFR
can
not
be
less
than
the
population
fatality
rate
.
As
of
10
July
,
in
New
York
City
,
with
a
population
of
8.4
million
,
23,377
individuals
(
18,758
confirmed
and
4,619
probable
)
have
died
with
COVID-19
(
0.3
%
of
the
population
)
.
[
300
]
Antibody
testing
in
New
York
City
suggested
an
IFR
of
~0.9
%
,
[
301
]
and
~1.4
%
.
[
302
]
In
Bergamo
province
,
0.6
%
of
the
population
has
died
.
[

In
September
2020
the
U.S.
Center
for

reported
preliminary
estimates

age-specific
IFRs

public
health
planning
purposes
.
[

COVID-19
case
fatality
rates
are
higher
among
men
than
women
in
most
countries
.
However
,
in
a
few
countries
like
India
,
Nepal
,
Vietnam
,
and
Slovenia
the
fatality
cases
are
higher
in
women
than
men
.
[
284

Globally
,
men
are
more
likely
to
be
admitted
to
the
ICU
and
more
likely
to
die
.
[
306
]
[
307
]
One
meta-analysis
found
that
globally
,
men
were
more
likely
to
get
COVID-19
than
women
;
there
were
approximately
55
men
and
45
women
per
100
infections
(
CI
:
51.43–56.58
)
.
[

The
Chinese
Center
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
reported
the
death
rate
was
2.8
%
for
men
and
1.7
%
for
women
.
[
309
]
Later
reviews
in
June
2020
indicated
that
there
is
no
significant
difference
in
susceptibility
or
in
CFR
between
genders
.
[

[

One
review
acknowledges
the
different
mortality
rates
in
Chinese
men
,
suggesting
that
it
may
be
attributable
to
lifestyle
choices
such
as
smoking
and
drinking
alcohol
rather
than
genetic
factors
.
[
312
]
Smoking
,
which
in
some
countries
like
China
is
mainly
a
male
activity
,
is
a
habit
that
contributes
to
increasing
significantly
the
case
fatality
rates
among
men
.
[
284
]
Sex-based
immunological
differences
,
lesser
prevalence
of
smoking
in
women
and
men
developing
co-morbid
conditions
such
as
hypertension
at
a
younger
age
than
women
could
have
contributed
to
the
higher
mortality
in
men
.
[
313
]
In
Europe
,
57
%
of
the
infected
people
were
men
and
72
%
of
those
died
with
COVID-19
were
men
.
[

]
As
of
April
2020
,
the
US
government
is
not
tracking
sex-related
data
of
COVID-19
infections
.
[
315

Research
has
shown
that
viral
illnesses
like
Ebola
,
HIV
,
influenza
and
SARS
affect
men
and
women
differently
.
[

In
the
US
,
a
greater
proportion
of
deaths
due
to
COVID-19
have
occurred
among
African
Americans
and
other
minority
groups
.
[

Structural
factors
that
prevent
them
from
practicing
social
distancing
include
their
concentration
in
crowded
substandard
housing
and
in
``
essential
''
occupations
such
as
retail
grocery
workers
,
public
transit
employees
,
health-care
workers
and
custodial

.
Greater
prevalence
of
lacking
health
insurance
and
care
of
underlying
conditions
such
as
diabetes
,
hypertension
,
and
heart
disease
also
increase
their
risk
of
death
.

On
the
one
hand
,
in
the
Dominican
Republic
there
is
a
clear
example
of
both
gender
and
ethnic

In
this
Latin
American
territory
,
there
is
great
inequality
and
precariousness
that
especially
affects
Dominican
women
,
with
greater
emphasis
on
those
of

serious
illness
compared
to

[

The
source
attributes
it
to
disproportionately
high
rates
of
many
health
conditions
that
may
put
them
at

More
severe

Biological
factors
(
immune

When

COVID-19
,
they
might
be
at
greater
risk

COVID-19
also
poses
a
greater
risk
to
people
who
misuse
opioids

The
WHO
recommended
that
people

as
testing
positive

COVID-19
could
not
rule
out

In
June
,
initial
results
from
the
randomised
RECOVERY
Trial
in

people
who
are
critically
ill
on
ventilators

one
fifth
for
those
receiving
supplemental

Because
this

welcomed
by
the
WHO
,

COVID-19
(
conditional
recommendation
,
based

Prophylactic

Viral
neutralization
is
the
anticipated
mechanism
of
action
by
which
passive
antibody
therapy
can
mediate
defence
against
SARS-CoV-2
.
The
spike
protein

the
primary
target
for
neutralizing

As
of
8
August

eight
neutralizing
antibodies
targeting
the
spike
protein
of
SARS-CoV-2

[

It
has
been
proposed
that
selection
of
broad-neutralizing
antibodies
against
SARS-CoV-2
and
SARS-CoV
might
be
useful
for
treating
not
only
COVID-19

also
future
SARS-related
CoV
infections
.
[

Other
mechanisms
,
however
,
such
as
antibody-dependent
cellular

phagocytosis
,
may
be
possible

The
use
of
passive
antibodies
to
treat
people
with
active
COVID-19
is
also
being
studied

This
involves
the
production
of
convalescent
serum
,
which
consists
of
the
liquid
portion
of
the
blood
from
people
who
recovered
from
the
infection
and
contains
antibodies
specific
to
this
virus
,
which
is
then
administered
to
active
patients
.
[

This
strategy
was
tried
for
SARS
with
inconclusive
results
.
[

An
updated
Cochrane
review

convalescent
plasma

There
continues
to
be
uncertainty
about
the
safety
of
convalescent
plasma
administration
to
people

differing
outcomes
measured

[

However
,
by
early-April
2021
,
a
major
second
wave
of
infections
took
hold
in
the
country
;
on
9

,
India
surpassed
1
million
active
cases

[

By

April
,
India
passed
2.5
million
active
cases
and
was
reporting
an
average
of
300,000
new
cases
and
2,000
deaths
per-day
.
Some
analysts
feared
this
was
an
undercount
.
[

On
30
April
,
India
reported
over
400,000
new
cases
and
over
3,500
deaths
in
one
day
.
[
55

Multiple
factors
have
been
proposed
to
have
potentially
contributed
to
the
sudden
spike
in
cases
,
including
highly-infectious
variants
of
concern
such
as
Lineage
B.1.617
,
[
56
]
[
57
]
a
lack
of
preparations

temporary
hospitals

often
dismantled
after

were
not
built

An
economic
slowdown
put
pressure
on
the
government
to
lift
restrictions
,
[
67
]
and
there
had
been
a
feeling
of
exceptionalism
based
on
the
hope
that
India
's
young
population
and
childhood
immunisation
scheme
would
blunt
the
impact
of
the
virus
.
[
67

Models
may
have
underestimated
projected
cases
and
deaths
due
to
the
under-reporting
of
cases
in
the
country

Due
to
high
demand

supply
issues
;
exports

suspended
to
meet
domestic
demand

[
69

there
have
been
shortages
of
the
raw
materials
required
to
manufacture
vaccines
domestically
,
[
70

while
hesitancy

a
lack
of
knowledge

rural
communities
has
also
impacted
the
programme
.
[

The
second
wave
placed
a
major
strain
on
the
healthcare
system
,
[

Initially
,
the

private
lab
after
a
qualified
physician

Experts
said
this
increased

Another
Indian
firm
,
Stempeutics
,
announced
plans
to
introduce

cell-based
agent
for
treating
critical
COVID-19
patients
;
[
137

the
research
will
continue
into

In
April
,
funds
for
a
number
of
preventive
agents
were
released
to
initiate
research
.
[

[
140
]
The
Centre
for
Cellular
and
Molecular
Biology
started
working
on
genome
sequencing
of
COVID-19
in
early
2020
.
[
141
]
According
to
estimates
,
in
March
2020
India
had
around
40,000
ventilators
,
of
which
8,432
are
with
the
public
sector
.
[
142
]
The
government
aimed
to
double
the
capacity
of
ventilators
by
June
2020
,
[
143
]
with
the
assistance
from
Indian
PSUs

ISRO
.
[
144
]
[
145
]
[
146
]
[
147
]
This
led
to
the
creation
of
some
of
the
world
's
smallest
and
cheapest
ventilators
.
[
148
]
Production
lines
have
also
been
repurposed
to
manufacture
general
PPEs
,
full
body
suits

250,000
N95
masks
per
day
in
May
2020
.
[
149

By
the
second
half
of
the
month
,
India
was
the
world
's
second
largest
producer
of
PPE
body

therapy
.
[

[
152
]
[
153

Initial
optimism
around
plasma
therapy
,
[
154
]
[
155
]
resulted
in
ICMR
stating
that
there
is
no
robust
evidence
to
support
convalescent
plasma
therapy
as
a
routine
therapy
,
describing
it
is
as
an
emerging
and
experimental
therapy
.
[
156

Convalescent
plasma
therapy
was
dropped
form
the
COVID-19
treatment
protocol
by

was
met
with
some
concern
,
as
the
vaccine
had
not
then
completed
phase
3
trials
.
[
168

Due
to
this
status
,
those
receiving
Covaxin
were
required
to
sign
a
consent
form
,
[
169

while
some
states

to
relegate
Covaxin
to
a

began
a
phased
lifting
of

which
extended
into
November
2020
.
[

The
government
was
criticised
for
not
using
the
lockdown
to
prepare
the
health
system
for
when
the
lockdown
would
be
lifted
.
[

India
's
covid
response
is
being
guided
by
a
number
of
committees
,
empowered
groups
,
advisory
groups
and
task
forces
.
Some
of
these
were
formed
before
the
pandemic
such
as
the
National
Technical
Advisory
Group
on
Immunisation
(
NTAGI
)
,
``
India

IDSP
was
brought
in
as
early
as
17
January
2020
.
[

Some
of
these
were
constituted
following
the
onset
of
the
pandemic
such
as
the
ICMR
COVID-19
Task
Force
.
[

The
National
Expert
Group
on

Administration
for
COVID-19
(
NEGVAC
)
,
formed
in
August
2020
would
guide
the
national
vaccine
delivery
strategy
.
[
203
]
In
October
2020
,
NEGVAC
advice
resulted
in
the
formation
of
a
three-tier
state
level
mechanism
for
the
implementation
of
the
vaccine
strategy
.
[
204
]
The
overall
response
has
been
led
by
the
Prime
Minister
and
his
office
;
at

The
role
of
the
National
Centre
for
Disease
Control
during
the
COVID-19
pandemic
has
been
questioned
including
the
subdued
sharing
of
data
collected
by
the
IDSP
.
[
321
]
Disease
surveillance
in
India
through
IDSP
faces
perpetual
shortage
of
funds
and
manpower
resulting
in
a
weak
nation-wide
data
collection
system
.
[
322
]
The
IDSP
does
not
track
deaths
taking
place
outside
hospitals
,
[
323
]
or
deaths
due
to
COVID-19
of
those
not
tested
,
[
324
]
one
of
the
many
reasons
under-counting
is
built
into
the
system
.
The
lack
of
epidemiologists
in
senior
decision
making
positions
of
COVID-19
related
committees
has
been
evident
,
[
321
]
including
the
absence
of
state-level
epidemiologists
in
a
number
of
states
.
[
325
]
In
April
2020
,
the
health
ministry
asked
states
to
go
on
a
hiring
spree
and
fill
vacancies
for
epidemiologists
.
[
326
]
Indian
Council
of
Medical
Research
has
been
criticised
for
did
not
updating
the
``
treatment
protocol
for
COVID-19
''
between
July
2020
and
April
2021
.
[
327

The
``
National
Task
Force
for
COVID-19
''
did
not
meet
during
February
and
March
despite
members
claiming
it
was
obvious
a
second
wave
was
in
the
making
.
[
327

A
number
of
warnings
pertaining
to
a
surge
in
cases
in
March
,
shortages
in
life-saving
equipment
and
a
second
wave
were
downsized
and
went
unheeded
.
[

A
number
of
problems
were
found
with
the
forecasting
and
modelling
by
the
National
COVID-19
Supermodel
Committee
by
independent
commentators
.
[
329

In
early
May
2021
,
the
committee
said
that
they
had
n't
been
able
to
predict
the
second
wave
accurately
.
[
330

[
331

A
lot
of
problems
with
India
's
failing
response
to
the
second

was
the
general
and
long
term
issues
of
the
public
health
system
in
India
.
[
322

The
Principal
Scientific
Advisor
to
the
Government
of
India
said
on
5
and
7
May
2021
that
``
Phase
3
is
inevitable
...
it
is
not
clear
on
what

prepare
for

[

[

and
that
``
If
we
take
strong
measures

It
all
depends

how
well

``
[

In
April
2020
,
Indian
officials
stated
that
India
was
studying
``
all
aspects
''
of
the
virus
including
its
origins
.
[
335

In
May
2020
India
supported
an
international
push
for
an
independent
inquiry
into
the
origins
of
COVID-19
.
The
push
for
an
inquiry
was
led
by
European
Union
and
Australia
and
backed
by
62
nations
.
[
336

In
November
2020
,
Chinese
scientists
claimed
the
virus
originated
in
the
Indian
subcontinent
.
[

In
May
2021
,
India
welcomed
further
studies

origin
of
the

[

The
2020
lockdown
left
tens
of
millions
of
migrant
workers
unemployed
.
[
340
]
[
341
]
With
factories
and
workplaces
shut
down
,
many
migrant
workers
were
left
with
no
livelihood
.
[
342
]
They
thus
decided
to
walk
hundreds
of
kilometres
to
go
back
to
their
native
villages
,
accompanied
by
their
families
in
many
cases
.
[
343
]
[
344
]
In
response
,
the
central
and
state
governments
took
various
measures
to
help
them
.
[
345
]
[
346
]
The
central
government
then
announced
that
it
had
asked
state
governments
to
set
up
immediate
relief
camps
for
the
migrant
workers
returning
to
their
native
states
,
[
347

and
later
issued
orders
protecting
the
rights
of
the
migrants
.
[

[

]
In
its
report
to
the
Supreme
Court
of
India
on
30
March
2020
,
the
central
government
stated
that
the
migrant
workers
,
apprehensive
about
their
survival
,
moved
in
the
panic
created
by
fake
news
that
the
lockdown
would
last
for
more
than
three
months
.
[

[

In

May
,
the
central

permitted
the
Indian
Railways
to
launch
``
Shramik
Special
''
trains
for
the
migrant
workers
and
others
stranded
,
[

this
move
had
its
own
complications
.
[
353

[
354

[

On
26
May
,
the
Supreme
Court
admitted
that
the
problems
of
the
migrants
had
still
not
been
solved

Indian
pharma
companies
raised
the
issue
that

in
China
became
worse
.
[
357

India
sources
about
70
%
of
its
pharmaceutical
ingredients
from
China
.
[
358
]
In
March
2020
,
India
restricted
export
of
26
pharmaceutical
ingredients
;
this
restriction
pointed
to
impending
global
shortages
.
[
358
]
During
the
second
wave
of
the
pandemic
in
India
shortages
of
certain
drugs
caused
some
COVID-19
patients
to
go
to
the
black
market

Only
a

Due
to
limited
social
movement
restrictions
during
the
second
wave
relative
to
lockdown
measures
during

the
economic
impact

Prior
to
COVID‑19
,
a
vaccine
for
an
infectious
disease
had
never
been
produced
in
less
than
several
years
–
and
no
vaccine
existed
for
preventing
a
coronavirus
infection
in
humans
.
[

However
,
vaccines
have
been
produced
against
several
animal
diseases
caused
by
coronaviruses
,
including
(
as
of
2003
)
infectious
bronchitis
virus
in
birds
,
canine
coronavirus
,
and
feline
coronavirus
.
[

Previous
projects
to
develop
vaccines
for
viruses
in
the
family
Coronaviridae
that
affect
humans
have
been
aimed
at
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
(
SARS
)
and
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
(
MERS
)
.
Vaccines
against
SARS
[
16
]
and
MERS
[
17
]
have
been
tested
in
non-human
animals
.
According
to
studies
published
in
2005
and
2006
,
the
identification
and
development
of
novel
vaccines
and
medicines
to
treat
SARS
was
a
priority
for
governments
and
public
health
agencies
around
the
world
at
that
time
.
[

[

[

As
of
2020
,
there
is
no
cure
or
protective
vaccine
proven
to
be
safe
and
effective
against
SARS
in
humans
.
[
21
]
[
22
]
There
is
also
no
proven
vaccine
against
MERS
.
[
23
]
When
MERS
became
prevalent
,
it
was
believed
that
existing
SARS
research
might
provide
a
useful
template
for
developing
vaccines
and
therapeutics
against
a
MERS-CoV
infection
.
[
21
]
[
24
]
As
of
March
2020
,
there
was
one
(
DNA-based
)
MERS
vaccine
which
completed
Phase
I
clinical
trials
in
humans
,
[
25
]
and
three
others
in
progress
,
all
being
viral-vectored
vaccines
:
two
adenoviral-vectored
(
ChAdOx1-MERS
,
BVRS-GamVac
)
and
one
MVA-vectored
(
MVA-MERS-S
)
.
[

Since
January
2020
,
vaccine
development
has
been
expedited
via
unprecedented
collaboration
in
the
multinational
pharmaceutical
industry
and
between
governments
.
[

Multiple
steps
along
the
entire
development
path
are
evaluated

There
have
been
several
unique
challenges
with
COVID-19
vaccine
development
.
The
urgency
to
create
a
vaccine
for
COVID‑19
led
to
compressed
schedules
that
shortened
the
standard
vaccine
development
timeline
,
in
some
cases
combining
clinical
trial
steps
over
months
,
a
process
typically
conducted
sequentially
over
years
.
[
29
]
Timelines
for
conducting
clinical
research
–
normally
a
sequential
process
requiring
years
–
are
being
compressed
into
safety
,
efficacy
,
and
dosing
trials
running
simultaneously
over
months
,
potentially
compromising
safety
assurance
.
[

]
[
30
]
As
an
example
,
Chinese
vaccine
developers
and
the
government
Chinese
Center
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
began
their
efforts
in
January
2020
,
[
31
]
and
by
March
were
pursuing
numerous
candidates
on
short
timelines
,
with
the
goal
to
showcase
Chinese
technology
strengths
over
those
of
the
United
States
,
and
to
reassure
the
Chinese
people
about
the
quality
of
vaccines
produced
in
China
.
[
29
]
[
32
]
The
rapid
development
and
urgency
of
producing
a
vaccine
for
the
COVID‑19
pandemic
may
increase
the
risks
and
failure
rate
of
delivering
a
safe
,
effective
vaccine
.
[
33
]
[
34
]
[
35
]
Additionally
,
research
at
universities
is
obstructed
by
physical
distancing
and
closing
of
laboratories
.
[
36
]
[
37
]
Vaccines
must
progress
through
several
phases
of
clinical
trials
to
test
for
safety
,
immunogenicity
,
effectiveness
,
dose
levels
and
adverse
effects
of
the
candidate
vaccine
.
[
38
]
[
39
]
Vaccine
developers
have
to
invest
resources
internationally
to
find
enough
participants
for
Phase
II–III
clinical
trials
when
the
virus
has
proved
to
be
a
``
moving
target
''
of
changing
transmission
rates
across
and
within
countries
,
forcing
companies
to
compete
for
trial
participants
.
[
40
]
Clinical
trial
organizers
also
may
encounter
people
unwilling
to
be
vaccinated
due
to
vaccine
hesitancy
[
41
]
or
disbelief
in
the
science
of
the
vaccine
technology
and
its
ability
to
prevent
infection
.
[
42
]
As
new
vaccines
are
developed
during
the
COVID‑19
pandemic
,
licensure
of
COVID‑19
vaccine
candidates
requires
submission
of
a
full
dossier
of
information
on
development

are
under
research
and
development
to
create
an

.
[

[
27

Most
of
the
platforms
of
vaccine
candidates
in
clinical
trials
are
focused
on
the
coronavirus
spike
protein
and
its
variants
as
the
primary
antigen
of
COVID‑19
infection
.
[
27
]
Platforms
being
developed
in

involved
nucleic
acid
technologies

,
non-replicating
viral

Many
vaccine
technologies
being
developed
for
COVID‑19
are
not
like
vaccines
already
in
use
to
prevent
influenza
,
but
rather
are
using
``
next-generation
''
strategies
for
precise
targeting
of
COVID‑19
infection
mechanisms
.
[
27

[
33
]
[
34
]
Several
of
the
synthetic
vaccines
use
a
2P
mutation
to
lock
the
spike
protein
into
its
prefusion
configuration
,
stimulating
an
immune
response
to
the
virus
before
it
attaches
to
a
human
cell
.
[

Vaccine
platforms
in
development
may
improve
flexibility
for
antigen
manipulation
,
and
effectiveness
for
targeting
mechanisms
of
COVID‑19
infection
in
susceptible
population
subgroups
,
such
as
healthcare
workers
,
the
elderly
,
children

pregnant
women
,
and
people
with
weakened
immune
systems

An
RNA
vaccine
contains
RNA
which
,
when
introduced
into
a
tissue
,
acts
as
messenger
RNA
(
mRNA
)
to
cause
the
cells
to
build
the
foreign
protein
and
stimulate
an
adaptive
immune
response
which
teaches
the
body
how
to
identify
and
destroy
the
corresponding
pathogen
or
cancer
cells
.
RNA
vaccines
often
,
but
not
always
,
use
nucleoside-modified
messenger
RNA
.
The
delivery
of
mRNA
is
achieved
by
a
coformulation
of
the
molecule
into
lipid
nanoparticles
which
protect
the
RNA
strands
and
help
their
absorption
into
the
cells
.

0
%
means
that

An
efficacy
of
50

means
that
there

The
vaccine
's
efficacy
may
be
adversely
effected
if

It
is
not
straightforward
to
compare
the
efficacies

In
the
case
of
COVID‑19
,
a
vaccine
efficacy
of
67
%
may
be
enough
to
slow
the
pandemic
,
but
this
assumes
that
the
vaccine
confers
sterilizing
immunity
,
which
is
necessary
to
prevent
transmission
.
Vaccine
efficacy
reflects
disease
prevention

a
poor
indicator

and
depending
on

the

Efficacy
against
severe
COVID-19

the
most

While
the
most
immediate
goal
of
vaccination
during
a
pandemic
is
to
protect
individuals
from
disease
,
a
long-term
goal
is
to
eventually
eradicate
it
.
To
do
so
,
the
proportion
of
the
population
that
must
be
immunized
must
be
greater
than
the
critical
vaccination
coverage
Assuming
the

R0

the

to
be
greater

As
of
June
2021
,
several
post-marketing
studies
have
already
estimated
the
effectiveness
of
some
vaccines
against
asymptomatic
infection
.
Prevention
of
infection
has
an
impact
on
slowing
transmission
(
particularly
asymptomatic
and
pre-symptomatic
)
,
but
the
exact
extent
of
this
effect
is
still
under
investigation

Some
variants

transmissivity

an

effective
reproduction
number

the

these

is
increased
,
requiring
greater
vaccine
coverage
,
greater
vaccine
effectiveness
against
transmission
,
or
a
combination
of
both
.
The
interplay
between
the
SARS-CoV-2
virus
and
its
human
hosts

initially
natural

,
eleven
of

a
substance
formulated
with

to
elevate
the
immune
response
to
an
antigen
,
such
as
the
COVID‑19
virus

Specifically
,
an
adjuvant
may
be
used
in

a
COVID‑19

candidate
to
boost
its
immunogenicity
and
efficacy
to
reduce
or
prevent
COVID‑19
infection
in
vaccinated
individuals
.
[

Adjuvants
used
in
COVID‑19
vaccine
formulation
may
be
particularly
effective
for
technologies
using
the
inactivated
COVID‑19
virus
and
recombinant
protein-based
or
vector-based
vaccines
.

of
choice
in

pool
their
excess
COVID-19
vaccine
capacity
to
make
up
for
a
125-million-dose
gap

The
program
mostly
relied
on
the
Oxford–AstraZeneca
COVID-19
vaccine
produced
by

which
faced
serious
supply
problems
due
to
increased
domestic
vaccine

Currently
,
only
a
limited
amount
of
vaccines
can
be
distributed
efficiently
,
and
the
shortfall
of
vaccines
in
South
America

a
lack

contributionsTo
ultimately
combat
the
emerging
COVID-19
pandemic
,
it
is
desired
to
develop
an
effective
and
safe
vaccine
against
this
highly
contagious
disease
caused
by
the
SARS-CoV-2
coronavirus
.
Our
literature
and
clinical
trial
survey
showed
that
the
whole
virus
,
as
well
as
the
spike
(
S
)
protein
,
nucleocapsid
(
N
)
protein
,
and
membrane
protein
,
have
been
tested
for
vaccine
development
against
SARS
and
MERS
.
We
further
used
the
Vaxign
reverse
vaccinology
tool
and
the
newly
developed
Vaxign-ML
machine
learning
tool
to
predict
COVID-19
vaccine
candidates
.
The
N
protein
was
found
to
be
conserved
in
the
more
pathogenic
strains
(
SARS/MERS/COVID-19
)
,
but
not
in
the
other
human
coronaviruses
that
mostly
cause
mild
symptoms
.
By
investigating
the
entire
proteome
of
SARS-CoV-2
,
six
proteins
,
including
the
S
protein
and
five
non-structural
proteins
(
nsp3
,
3CL-pro
,
and
nsp8–10
)
were
predicted
to
be
adhesins
,
which
are
crucial
to
the
viral
adhering
and
host
invasion
.
The
S
,
nsp3
,
and
nsp8
proteins
were
also
predicted
by
Vaxign-ML
to
induce
high
protective
antigenicity
.
Besides
the
commonly
used
S
protein
,
the
nsp3
protein
has
not
been
tested
in
any
coronavirus
vaccine
studies
and
was
selected
for
further
investigation
.
The
nsp3
was
found
to
be
more
conserved
among
SARS-CoV-2
,
SARS-CoV
,
and
MERS-CoV
than
among
15
coronaviruses
infecting
human
and
other
animals
.
The
protein
was
also
predicted
to
contain
promiscuous
MHC-I
and
MHC-II
T-cell
epitopes
,
and
linear
B-cell
epitopes
localized
in
specific
locations
and
functional
domains
of
the
protein
.
Our
predicted
vaccine
targets
provide
new
strategies
for
effective
and
safe
COVID-19
vaccine
development.The
emerging
Coronavirus
Disease
2019
(
COVID-19
)
pandemic
poses
a
massive
crisis
to
global
public
health
.
As
of
March
11
,
2020
,
there
were
118,326
confirmed
cases
and
4,292
deaths
,
according
to
the
World
Health
Organization
(
WHO
)
,
and
WHO
declared
the
COVID-19
as
a
pandemic
on
the
same
day
.
The
causative
agent
of
the
COVID-19
disease
is
the
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
2
(
SARS-CoV-2
)
.
Coronaviruses
can
cause
animal
diseases
such
as
avian
infectious
bronchitis
caused
by
the
infectious
bronchitis
virus
(
IBV
)
,
and
pig
transmissible
gastroenteritis
caused
by
a
porcine
coronavirus1
.
Bats
are
commonly
regarded
as
the
natural
reservoir
of
coronaviruses
,
which
can
be
transmitted
to
humans
and
other
animals
after
genetic
mutations
.
There
are
seven
known
human
coronaviruses
,
including
the
novel
SARS-CoV-2
.
Four
of
them
(
HCoV-HKU1
,
HCoV-OC43
,
HCoV-229E
,
and
HCoV-NL63
)
have
been
circulating
in
the
human
population
worldwide
and
cause
mild
symptoms2
.
Coronavirus
became
prominence
after
Severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
(
SARS
)
and
Middle
East
Respiratory
Syndrome
(
MERS
)
outbreaks
.
In
2003
,
the
SARS
disease
caused
by
the
SARS-associated
coronavirus
(
SARS-CoV
)
infected
over
8,000
people
worldwide
and
was
contained
in
the
summer
of
20033
.
SARS-CoV-2
and
SARS-CoV
share
high
sequence
identity4
.
The
MERS
disease
infected
more
than
2,000
people
,
which
is
caused
by
the
MERS-associated
coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
and
was
first
reported
in
Saudi
Arabia
and
spread
to
several
other
countries
since
20125.There
is
no
human
vaccine
on
the
market
to
prevent
COVID-19
,
and
there
is
an
urgent
need
to
develop
a
safe
and
effective
vaccine
to
prevent
this
highly
infectious
disease
.
Coronaviruses
are
positively-stranded
RNA
viruses
with
its
genome
packed
inside
the
nucleocapsid
(
N
)
protein
and
enveloped
by
the
membrane
(
M
)
protein
,
envelope
(
E
)
protein
,
and
the
spike
(
S
)
protein6
.
While
many
coronavirus
vaccine
studies
targeting
different
structural
proteins
were
conducted
,
most
of
these
efforts
eventually
ceased
soon
after
the
outbreak
of
SARS
and
MERS
.
With
the
recent
COVID-19
pandemic
outbreak
,
it
is
urgent
to
resume
the
coronavirus
vaccine
research
.
As
the
immediate
response
to
the
ongoing
pandemic
,
the
first
testing
in
humans
of
the
mRNA-based
vaccine
targeting
the
S
protein
of
SARS-CoV-2

started
on
March
16
,
2020
.
As
the
most
superficial
and
protrusive
protein
of
the
coronaviruses
,
S
protein
plays
a
crucial
role
in
mediating
virus
entry
.
In
the
SARS
vaccine
development
,
the
full-length
S
protein
and
its
S1
subunit
(
which
contains
receptor
binding
domain
)
have
been
frequently
used
as
the
vaccine
antigens
due
to
their
ability
to
induce
neutralizing
antibodies
that
prevent
host
cell
entry
and
infection
.
However
,
studies
showed
that
S
protein-based
vaccination
did
not
provide
full
protection
and
sometimes
raise
safety
concerns7,8
.
In
the
meantime
,
many
other
research
groups
and
companies
are
also
putting
great
efforts
into
developing
and
manufacture
COVID-19
vaccines.Reported
SARS-CoV
,
MERS-CoV
,
SARS-CoV-2
vaccine
clinical
trials.In
recent
years
,
the
development
of
vaccine
design
has
been
revolutionized
by
the
reverse
vaccinology
(
RV
)
,
which
aims
to
first
identify
promising
vaccine
candidate
through
bioinformatics
analysis
of
the
pathogen
genome
.
RV
has
been
successfully
applied
to
vaccine
discovery
for
pathogens
such
as
Group
B
meningococcus
and
led
to
the
license
Bexsero
vaccine9
.
Among
current
RV
prediction
tools10,11
,
Vaxign
is
the
first
web-based
RV
program12
and
has
been
used
to
successfully
predict
vaccine
candidates
against
different
bacterial
and
viral
pathogens13–15
.
Recently
we
have
also
developed
a
machine
learning
approach
called
Vaxign-ML
to
enhance
prediction
accuracy16.In
this
study
,
we
first
surveyed
the
existing
coronavirus
vaccine
development
status
,
and
then
applied
the
Vaxign
RV
and
Vaxign-ML
approaches
to
predict
COVID-19
protein
candidates
for
vaccine
development
.
We
identified
six
possible
adhesins
,
including
the
structural
S
protein
and
five
other
non-structural
proteins
,
and
three
of
them
(
S
,
nsp3
,
and
nsp8
proteins
)
were
predicted
to
induce
high
protective
immunity
.
The
S
protein
was
predicted
to
have
the
highest
protective
antigenicity
score
and
it
has
been
extensively
studied
as
the
target
of
coronavirus
vaccines
by
other
researchers
.
Here
we
selected
nsp3
protein
as
an
alternative
vaccine
candidate
,
which
was
predicted
to
have
the
second-highest
protective
antigenicity
score
yet
,
has
not
been
considered
in
any
vaccine
studies
.
We
investigated
the
sequence
conservation
and
immunogenicity
of
the
multi-domain
nsp3
protein
as
a
vaccine
candidate.To
better
understand
the
current
status
of
coronavirus
vaccine
development
,
we
systematically
surveyed
the
development
of
vaccines
for
coronavirus
from
the
ClinicalTrials.gov
database
and
PubMed
literature
(
as
of
March
17
,
2020
)
.
Extensive
effort
has
been
made
to
develop
a
safe
and
effective
vaccine
against
SARS
or
MERS
,
and
the
most
advance
clinical
trial
study
is
currently
at
phase
II
(
Table
1
)
.
It
is
a
challenging
task
to
quickly
develop
a
safe
and
effective
vaccine
for
the
on-going
COVID-19
pandemic.There
are
two
primary
design
strategies
for
coronavirus
vaccine
development
:
the
usage
of
the
whole
virus
or
genetically
engineered
vaccine
antigens
that
can
be
delivered
through
different
formats
.
The
whole
virus
vaccines
include
inactivated17
or
live
attenuated
vaccines18,19
(
Table
2
)
.
The
two
live
attenuated
SARS
vaccines
mutated
the
exoribonuclease
and
envelop
protein
to
reduce
the
virulence
and/or
replication
capability
of
the
SARS-CoV
.
Overall
,
the
whole
virus
vaccines
can
induce
a
strong
immune
response
and
protect
against
coronavirus
infections
.
Genetically
engineered
vaccines
that
target
specific
coronavirus
protein
are
often
used
to
improve
vaccine
safety
and
efficacy
.
The
coronavirus
antigens
such
as
S
protein
,
N
protein
,
and
M
protein
can
be
delivered
as
recombinant
DNA
vaccine
and
viral
vector
vaccine

first
used
the
Vaxign
analysis
framework12,16
to
compare
the
full
proteomes
of
seven
human
coronavirus
strains
(
SARS-CoV-2
,
SARS-CoV
,
MERS-CoV
,
HCoV-229E
,
HCoV-OC43
,
HCoV-NL63
,
and
HCoV-HKU1
)
.
The
proteins
of
SARS-CoV-2
were
used
as
the
seed
for
the
pan-genomic
comparative
analysis
.
The
Vaxign
pan-genomic
analysis
reported
only
the
N
protein
in
SARS-CoV-2
having
high
sequence
similarity
among
the
more
severe
form
of
coronavirus
(
SARS-CoV
and
MERS-CoV
)
,
while
having
low
sequence
similarity
among
the
more
typically
mild
HCoV-229E
,
HCoV-OC43
,
HCoV-NL63
,
and
HCoV-HKU1
.
The
sequence
conservation
suggested
the
potential
of
N
protein
as
a
candidate
for
the
cross-protective
vaccine
against
SARS
and
MERS
.
The
N
protein
was
also
evaluated
and
used
for
vaccine
development
(
Table
2
)
.
The
N
protein
packs
the
coronavirus
RNA
to
form
the
helical
nucleocapsid
in
virion
assembly
.
This
protein
is
more
conserved
than
the
S
protein
and
was
reported
to
induce
an
immune
response
and
neutralize
coronavirus
infections20
.
However
,
a
study
also
showed
the
linkage
between
N
protein
and
severe
pneumonia
or
other
serious
liver
failures
related
to
the
pathogenesis
of
SARS21.The
Vaxign
RV
analysis
predicted
six
SARS-CoV-2
proteins
(
S
protein
,
nsp3
,
3CL-PRO
,
and
nsp8–10
)
as
adhesive
proteins
(
Table
3
)
.
Adhesin
plays
a
critical
role
in
the
virus
adhering
to
the
host
cell
and
facilitating
the
virus
entry
to
the
host
cell22
,
which
has
a
significant
association
with
the
vaccine-induced
protection23
.
In
SARS-CoV-2
,
S
protein
was
predicted
to
be
adhesin
,
matching
its
primary
role
in
virus
entry
.
The
structure
of
SARS-CoV-2
S
protein
was
determined24
and
reported
to
contribute
to
the
host
cell
entry
by
interacting

computed
the

(

)
score
and
predicted
the
induction
of
protective

by
a

.
The

data
consisted
of
viral
protective
antigens
,
which
were
tested
to
be
protective
in
at

model27
.
The
performance
of
the
Vaxign-ML
models
was
evaluated
(

S1
and
Figure

)
,
and
the
best
performing
model
had
a
weighted
F1-score
of
0.94
.
Using
the
optimized
Vaxign-ML
model
,
we
predicted
three
proteins
(
S
protein
,
nsp3
,
and
nsp8
)
as
vaccine
candidates
with
significant
protegenicity
scores
(
Table

)
.
The
S
protein
was
predicted
to
have
the
highest
protegenicity
score
,
which
is
consistent
with
the
experimental
observations
reported
in
the
literature
.
The
nsp3
protein
is
the
second
most
promising
vaccine
candidate
besides
S
protein
.
There
was
currently
no

26

Therefore
,
we
selected
nsp3
for
further
investigation
,
as
described
below.The
multiple

the

.Our
prediction
of
the
potential
SARS-CoV-2
antigens
,
which
could
induce
protective
immunity
,
provides
a
timely
analysis
for
the
vaccine
development
against
COVID-19
.
Currently
,
most
coronavirus
vaccine
studies
use
the
whole
inactivated
or
attenuated
virus
,
or
target
the
structural
proteins
such
as
the
spike
(
S
)
protein
,
nucleocapsid
(
N
)
protein
,
and
membrane
(
M
)
protein
(
Table
2
)
.
But
the
inactivated
or
attenuated
whole
virus
vaccine
might
induce
strong
adverse
events
.
On
the
other
hand
,
vaccines
targeting
the
structural
proteins
induce
a
strong
immune
response20,29,30
.
In
some
studies
,
these
structural
proteins
,
including
the
S
and
N
proteins
,
were
reported
to
associate
with
the
pathogenesis
of
coronavirus21,31
and
might
raise
safety
concern
.
A
study
has
shown
increased
liver
pathology
in
the
vaccinated
ferrets
immunized
with
modified
vaccinia
Ankara-S
recombinant
vaccine32
.
Although
there
were
no
other
adverse
events
reported
in
other
animal
studies
,
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
these
vaccination
strategies
has
not
been
tested
in
human
clinical
trials
.
Our
study
applied
the
state-of-the-art
Vaxign
reserve
vaccinology
(
RV
)
and
Vaxign-ML
machine
learning
strategies
to
the
entire
SARS-CoV-2
proteomes
including
both
structural
and
non-structural
proteins
for
vaccine
candidate
prediction
.
Our
results
indicate
for
the
first
time
that
many
non-structural
proteins
could
be
used
as
potential
vaccine
candidates.The
SARS-CoV-2
S
protein
was
identified
by
our
Vaxign
and
Vaxign-ML
analysis
as
the
most
favorable
vaccine
candidate
.
First
,
the
Vaxign
RV
framework
predicted
the
S
protein
as
a
likely
adhesin
,
which
is
consistent
with
the
role
of
S
protein
for
the
invasion
of
host
cells
.
Second
,
our
Vaxign-ML
predicted
that
the
S
protein
had
a
high
protective
antigenicity
score
.
These
results
confirmed
the
role
of
S
protein
as
the
important
target
of
COVID-19
vaccines
.
However
,
the
S
protein
exists
in
many
coronaviruses
,
and
many
non-pathogenic
human
coronaviruses
also
use
S
protein
to
cell
invasion
.
For
example
,
despite
markedly
weak
pathogenicity
,
HCoV-NL63
also
uses
S
protein
and
employs
the
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
2
(
ACE2
)
for
cellular
entry33
.
This
suggests
that
the
S
protein
is
not
the
only
factor
determining
the
infection
level
of
a
human
coronavirus
.
In
addition
,
targeting
only
the
S
protein
may
induce
high
serum-neutralizing
antibody
titers
but
can
not
induce
sufficient
protective
efficacy34
.
Thus
,
alternative
vaccine
antigens
may
be
considered.The
SARS-CoV-2
nsp3
protein
was
predicted
to
be
a
potential
vaccine
candidate
,
as
shown
by
its
predicted
second-highest
protective
antigenicity
score
,
adhesin
property
,
promiscuous
MHC-I
&
MHC-II
T
cell
epitopes
,
and
B
cell
epitopes
.
The
nsp3
is
the
largest
non-structural
protein
that
includes
multiple
functional
domains
to
support
viral
pathogenesis26
.
The
multiple
sequence
alignment
of
nsp3
also
showed
higher
sequence
conservation
in
most
of
the
functional
domains
in
SARS-CoV-2
,
SARS-CoV
,
and
MERS-CoV
,
than
in
all
15
coronavirus
strains
(
Fig
.
1B
)
.
The
induction
of
nsp3-specific
immunity
would
likely
help
the
host
to
fight
against
the
infection
.
Besides
the
S
and
nsp3
proteins
,
our
study
also
suggested
four
additional
vaccine
candidates
,
including
3CL-pro
,
nsp8
,
nsp9
,
and
nsp10
.
All
these
proteins
were
predicted
as
adhesins
,
and
the
nsp8
protein
was
also
predicted
to
have
a
significant
protective
antigenicity
score.Our
predicted
non-structural
proteins
(
nasp3
,
3CL-pro
,
nsp8
,
nsp9
,
and
nsp10
)
are
not
part
of
the
viral
structural
particle
,
and
none
of
the
non-structural
proteins
have
been
evaluated
as
vaccine
candidates
.
The
SARS/MERS/COVID-19
vaccine
studies
so
far
target
the
structural
(
S/M/N
)
proteins
.
Still
,
the
non-structural
proteins
have
been
used
effective
vaccine
antigens
to
stimulate
protective
immunity
against
many
viruses
.
For
example
,
the
non-structural
protein
NS1
was
found
to
induce
protective
immunity
against
the
infections
by
flaviviruses35
.
The
non-structural
proteins
of
the
hepatitis
C
virus
were
reported
to
induce
HCV-specific
vigorous
and
broad-spectrum
T-cell
responses36
.
The
non-structural
HIV-1
gene
products
were
also
shown
to
be
valuable
targets
for
prophylactic
or
therapeutic
vaccines37
.
Therefore
,
it
is
reasonable
to
consider
the
SARS-CoV-2
non-structural
proteins
as
possible
vaccine
targets
,
as
suggested
by
the
present
study.Instead
of
using
a
single
protein
as
the
vaccine
antigen
,
we
would
like
to
propose
the
development
of
a
“
cocktail
vaccine
”
as
an
effective
strategy
for
COVID-19
vaccine
development
.
A
typical
cocktail
vaccine
includes
more
than
one
antigen
to
cover
different
aspects
of
protection39,40
.
The
licensed
Group
B
meningococcus
Bexsero
vaccine
,
which
was
developed
via
reverse
vaccinology
,
contains
three
protein
antigens9
.
To
develop
an
efficient
and
safe
COVID-19
cocktail
vaccine
,
it
is
possible
to
mix
the
structural
(
e.g.
,
S
protein
)
and
non-structural
(
e.g.
,
nsp3
)
viral
proteins
.
The
other
proteins
identified
in
our
study
may
also
be
considered
as
possible
vaccine
targets
.
The
benefit
of
a
cocktail
vaccine
strategy
could
induce
immunity
that
can
protect
the
host
against
not
only
the
S-ACE2
interaction
and
viral
entry
to
the
host
cells
,
but
also
protect
against
the
accessary
non-structural
adhesin
proteins
(
e.g.
,
nsp3
)
,
which
might
also
be
vital
to
the
viral
entry
and
replication
.
The
usage
of
more
than
one
antigen
allows
us
to
reduce
the
volume
of
each
antigen
and
thus
reducing
the
induction
of
adverse
events
.
Nonetheless
,
the
potentials
of
these
predicted
non-structural
protein
targets
in
vaccine
development
need
to
be
experimentally
validated.For
rational
COVID-19
vaccine
development
,
it
is
critical
to
understand
the
fundamental
host-coronavirus
interaction
and
protective
immune
mechanism7
.
Such
understanding
may
not
only
provide
us
guidance
in
terms
of
antigen
selection
but
also
facilitate
our
design
of
vaccine
formulations
.
For
example
,
an
important
foundation
of
our
prediction
in
this
study
is
based
on
our
understanding
of
the
critical
role
of
adhesin
as
a
virulence
factor
as
well
as
protective
antigen
.
The
choice
of
DNA
vaccine
,
recombinant
vaccine
vector
,
and
another
method
of
vaccine
formulation
is
also
deeply
rooted
in
our
understanding
of
pathogen-specific
immune
response
induction
.
Different
experimental
conditions
may
also
affect
results41,42
.
Therefore
,
it
is
crucial
to
understand
the
underlying
molecular
and
cellular
mechanisms
for
rational
vaccine
development.We
annotated
peer-reviewed
journal
articles
stored
in
the
PubMed
database
and
the
ClinicalTrials.gov
database
.
From
the
peer-reviewed
articles
,
we
identified
and
annotated
those
coronavirus
vaccine
candidates
that
were
experimentally
studied
and
found
to
induce
protective
neutralizing
antibody
or
provided
immunity
against
virulent
pathogen
challenge.The
SARS-CoV-2

was
obtained
from

The

then

scientists
began
seeking
a
vaccine
for
the
SARS-CoV-2
coronavirus
in
early
2020
,
they
were
careful
not
to
promise
quick
success
.
The
fastest
any
vaccine
had
previously
been
developed
,
from
viral
sampling
to
approval
,
was
four
years
,
for
mumps
in
the
1960s
.
To
hope
for
one
even
by
the
summer
of
2021
seemed
highly
optimistic.But
by
the
start
of
December
,
the
developers
of
several
vaccines
had
announced
excellent
results
in
large
trials
,
with
more
showing
promise
.
And
on
2
December
,
a
vaccine
made
by
drug
giant
Pfizer
with
German
biotech
firm
BioNTech
,
became
the
first
fully-tested
immunization
to
be
approved
for
emergency
use.That
speed
of
advance
“
challenges
our
whole
paradigm
of
what
is
possible
in
vaccine
development
”
,
says
Natalie
Dean
,
a
biostatistician
at
the
University
of
Florida
in
Gainesville
.
It
’
s
tempting
to
hope
that
other
vaccines
might
now
be
made
on
a
comparable
timescale
.
These
are
sorely
needed
:
diseases
such
as
malaria
,
tuberculosis
and
pneumonia
together
kill
millions
of
people
a
year
,
and
researchers
anticipate
further
lethal
pandemics
,
too.The
COVID-19
experience
will
almost
certainly
change
the
future
of
vaccine
science
,
says
Dan
Barouch
,
director
of
the
Center
for
Virology
and
Vaccine
Research
at
Harvard
Medical
School
in
Boston
,
Massachusetts
.
“
It
shows
how
fast
vaccine
development
can
proceed
when
there
is
a
true
global
emergency
and
sufficient
resources
,
”
he
says
.
New
ways
of
making
vaccines
,
such
as
by
using
messenger
RNA
(
mRNA
)
,
have
been
validated
by
the
COVID-19
response
,
he
adds
.
“
It
has
shown
that
the
development
process
can
be
accelerated
substantially
without
compromising
on
safety.

Charity/AFP/GettyThe
world
was
able
to
develop
COVID-19
vaccines
so
quickly
because
of
years
of
previous
research
on
related
viruses
and
faster
ways
to
manufacture
vaccines
,
enormous
funding
that
allowed
firms
to
run
multiple
trials
in
parallel
,
and
regulators
moving
more
quickly
than
normal
.
Some
of
those
factors
might
translate
to
other
vaccine
efforts
,
particularly
speedier
manufacturing
platforms.But
there
’
s
no
guarantee
.
To
repeat
such
rapid
success
will
require
similar
massive
funding
for
development
,
which
is
likely
to
come
only
if
there
is
a
comparable
sense
of
social
and
political
urgency
.
It
will
depend
,
too
,
on
the
nature
of
the
pathogen
.
With
SARS-CoV-2
,
a
virus
that
mutates
relatively
slowly
and
that
happens
to
belong
to
a
well-studied
family
,
scientists
might
—
strange
as
it
sounds
—
have
got
lucky.The
research
that
helped
to
develop
vaccines
against
the
new
coronavirus
didn
’
t
start
in
January
.
For
years
,
researchers
had
been
paying
attention
to
related
coronaviruses
,
which
cause
SARS
(
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
)
and
MERS
(
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
)
,
and
some
had
been
working
on
new
kinds
of
vaccine
—
an
effort
that
has
now
paid
off
spectacularly.Vials

Frayer/GettyConventional
vaccines
contain
viral
proteins
or
disabled
forms
of
the
virus
itself
,
which
stimulate
the
body
’
s
immune
defences
against
infection
by
a
live
virus
.
But
the
first
two
COVID-19
vaccines
for
which
efficacy
was
announced
in
large-scale
(
phase
III
)
clinical
trials
used
just
a
string
of
mRNA
inside
a
lipid
coat
.
The
mRNA
encodes
a
key
protein
of
SARS-CoV-2
;
once
the
mRNA
gets
inside
our
cells
,
our
bodies
produce
this
protein
.
That
acts
as
the
antigen
—
the
foreign
molecule
that
triggers
an
immune
response
.
The
vaccines
made
by
Pfizer
and
BioNTech
and
by
the
US
pharmaceutical
company
Moderna
both
use
mRNA
that
encodes
the
spike
protein
,
which
docks
to
human
cell
membranes
and
allows
the
coronavirus
to
invade
the
cell.
“
A
lot
went
into
the
mRNA
platform
that
we
have
today
,
”
says
immunologist
Akiko
Iwasaki
at
the
Yale
School
of
Medicine
in
New
Haven
,
Connecticut
,
who
has
worked
on
nucleic-acid
vaccines
—
those
based
on
lengths
of
DNA
or
RNA
—
for
more
than
two
decades
.
The
basic
research
on
DNA
vaccines
began
at
least
25
years
ago
,
and
RNA
vaccines
have
benefited
from
10–15
years
of
strong
research
,
she
says
,
some
aimed
at
developing
cancer
vaccines
.
The
approach
has
matured
just
at
the
right
time
;
five
years
ago
,
the
RNA
technology
would
not
have
been
ready.For
instance
,
researchers
at
the
US
National
Institute
of
Allergy
and
Infectious
Diseases
(
NIAID
)
in
Bethesda
,
Maryland
,
knew
from
their
research
on
MERS
and
SARS
that
it
was
best
to
tune
the
RNA
sequence
to
stabilize
the
resulting
spike
protein
in
the
form
it
adopts
before
it
docks
with
a
host
cell
.
“
If
you
can
trap
it
in
its
original
pre-fusion
state
,
it
becomes
a
much
better
vaccine
antigen
,
”
says
Barney
Graham
,
deputy
director
of
NIAID
’
s
vaccine
research
centre
.
That
work
gave
the
NIAID
team
,
which
worked
with
Moderna
,
a
head
start
once
SARS-CoV-2
was
sequenced
in
January
.
“
The
fact
that
people
had
been
paying
close
attention
to
coronaviruses
really
allowed
this
whole
process
to
accelerate

the
pharmaceutical
firm
AstraZeneca
with
the
University
of
Oxford
,
UK
,
does
not
use
mRNA
.
Instead
,
a
viral
vector
(
or
carrier
)
holds
extra
genetic
material
that
codes
for
the
SARS-CoV-2
spike
protein
.
This
,
too
,
benefited
from
years
of
research
to
select
the
vector
;
in
this
case
,
the
firm
chose
a
modified
form
of
adenovirus
isolated
from
chimpanzee
stool
.
Advances
in
conventional
vaccines
such
as
these
have
also
come
from
research
on
SARS
,
MERS
,
Ebola
and
malaria
,
says
Beate
Kampmann
,
director
of
the
Vaccine
Centre
at
the
London
School
of
Hygiene
&
Tropical
Medicine
,
and
such
approaches
remain
cheaper
than
using
mRNA.Vaccine
researchers
were
fortunate
with
SARS-CoV-2
in
many
respects
,
says
Iwasaki
.
The
virus
doesn
’
t
mutate
a
lot
or
have
effective
strategies
for
foiling
the
human
immune
system
,
she
says
,
unlike
HIV
,
herpes
or
even
influenza
.
The
herpes
virus
,
by
contrast
,
has
more
evasion
capability
—
it
actively
blocks
antibodies
from
binding
,
which
makes
it
harder
to
find
an
effective
agent
against
it
.
And
the
fast
mutation
of
flu
viruses
requires
a
different
vaccine
formulation
for
every
flu
season.The
slowest
part
of
vaccine
development
isn
’
t
finding
candidate
treatments
,
but
testing
them
.
This
often
takes
years
(
see
‘
Vaccine
innovation
’
)
,
with
companies
running
efficacy
and
safety
tests
on
animals
and
then
in
humans
.
Human
testing
requires
three
phases
that
involve
increasing
numbers
of
people
and
proportionately
escalating
costs
.
The
COVID-19
vaccines
went
through
the
same
trials
,
but
the
billions
poured
into
the
process
made
it
possible
for
companies
to
take
financial
risks
by
running
some
tests
at
the
same
time
(

A

,

well
as

,
says
Rino
Rappuoli
,
chief
scientist
at

.
This
meant
that
companies
could
gamble
on
starting
large-scale
testing
and
manufacturing
of
candidates
that
might
not
work
out
.
“
It
was
totally
de-risking
the
entire
development
process
,
”
says
Kampmann.The
vaccine
science
would
not
have
produced
such
fast
results
without
this
funding
,
she
says
.
“
It
didn

t
happen
with

,

was
devastating
communities
in
Africa
[
in

”
—
and
Ebola
vaccines
accordingly
took
longer
to
develop
.
The
money
only
materialized
this
time
because
all
countries
,

wealthy
ones
,
faced
economic
devastation
:
suggesting
that
the

of
future

,
including
for
existing

such
as

,
will
not
be
as
speedy
.
“
Unless

in
the
money
,
there
’

no

to
accelerate
,
”
says
Rappuoli.Virologist
Peter
Hotez
at
Baylor
College
of
Medicine
in
Houston
,
Texas
,
suggests
that
large
pharmaceutical
companies
might
have
been
motivated
not
just
by
the
desire
to
stop
the
pandemic
,
but
also
by
the
opportunity
for
governments
to
fund
their
research
and
development
.
With
public
investment
of
around
US
$
10
billion
,
the
US
Operation
Warp
Speed
vaccine
programme
“
represents
the
largest
government
stimulus
package
the
pharma
companies
have
ever
seen
”
,
says
Hotez.The
impetus
didn
’
t
all
come
from
the
urgency
of
the
COVID-19
pandemic
itself
.
Previous
infectious
and
lethal
viruses
have
motivated
the
creation
of
national
and
global
infrastructures
that
can
promote
faster
vaccine
development
.
The
Ebola
and
Zika
outbreaks
saw
the
beginning
of
better
global
coordination
in
how
to
respond
to
an
infectious-disease
crisis
,
Graham
says
.
“
If
SARS
in
2002
had
spread
like
this
,
we
wouldn
’
t
have
had
the
vaccine
technology
or
the
coordinated
systems
,
and
we
’
d
have
had
a
much
more
difficult
time
,
”
he
says.Sources

BioNTech/Pfizer
;
Nature
analysisIn
particular
,
the
Coalition
for
Epidemic
Preparedness
Innovations
(
CEPI
)
was
launched
in
2017
;
its
goal
is
to
create
the
technological
infrastructure
needed
for
rapid
and
affordable
development
of
vaccines
against
several
of
the
viruses
known
to
have
epidemic
potential
,
including
MERS
,
Ebola
and
Zika
.
CEPI
has
partly
funded
work
on
SARS-CoV-2
vaccines
,
including
that
by
Moderna
and
at
Oxford.In
the
final
stages
of
trials
,
it
helped
that
COVID-19
was
everywhere
because
firms
need
infections
to
show
that
vaccines
work
.
It
’
s
hard
to
run
efficacy
trials
when
the
diseases
themselves
aren
’
t
prevalent
—
especially
,
says
Dean
,
in
cases
such
as
MERS
,
for
which
outbreaks
of
disease
were
patchy
,
with
peaks
in
some
areas
and
low
infection
rates
in
others.The
COVID-19
experience
might
also
prompt
a
regulatory
rethink
.
Although
there
has
been
no
relaxing
of
the
stringent
criteria
for
vaccine
approval
,
the
first
candidates
are
mostly
being
approved
under
emergency-use
regulations
.
These
are
faster
but
require
companies
to
conduct
follow-up
surveys
to
look
for
side
effects
and
continuing
efficacy
.
National
regulators
also
swapped
information
on
COVID-19
vaccine
trials
under
the
auspices
of
a
global
body
called
the
International
Coalition
of
Medicines
Regulatory
Authorities
,
set
up
in
2012
.
It
has
aimed
to
reach
consensus
on
issues
such
as
the
best
end-points
for
vaccine
trials
,
and
how
to
harmonize
the
monitoring
of
side
effects
as
vaccines
are
rolled
out
(
see
also
Nature
588
,
195
;
2020
)
.The
COVID-19
pandemic
should
see
some
permanent
changes
in
vaccine
development
.
For
a
start
,
it
might
establish
the
use
of
mRNA
vaccines
—
which
hadn
’
t
previously
been
approved
for
general
use
in
people
—
as
a
speedy
approach
for
other
diseases
.
“
This
technology
is
revolutionizing
vaccinology
,
”
says
Kampmann
.
Candidate
mRNA
vaccines
can
be
chemically
synthesized
in
a

“
You
can

.
That
decreases
the
investment
required.
”
Companies
should
also
be
ramping
up
their
manufacturing
capacities
because
they
still
have
to
make
vaccines
for
measles
,
polio
and
other
diseases
even
as
they
produce
COVID-19
immunizations
.

could
help
to
meet

Balibouse/ReutersThe
large
clinical
trials
for
COVID-19
vaccines
,
and
others
in
development
,
should
provide
data
that
are
more
widely
useful
for
understanding
immune
responses
,
says
Hotez
.
“
Given
all
the
different
technologies
,
and
detailed
information
collected
on
clinical
volunteer
demographics
,
antibody
and
cellular
responses
,
we
might
learn
as
much
or
more
from
human
vaccine
responses
this
year
than
in
previous
decades
.
Human
vaccinology
could
make
a
quantum
leap.
”
Still
,
other
vaccines
can
probably
only
be
developed
at
a
comparable
speed
when
infection
levels
are
high
—
making
it
possible
to
run
massive
trials
relatively
quickly
—
and
with
huge
amounts
of
funding
.
And
other
viruses
might
be
harder
to
target
than
SARS-CoV-2
turned
out
to
be.That
’
s
why
we
need
to
know
more
about
all
families
of
viruses
,
say
researchers
.
There
are
at
least
24
other
virus
families
that
can
infect
humans
,
says
Graham
.
Rather
than
waiting
to
sink
resources
into
fighting
the
next
virus
that
pops
up
,
money
would
be
better
spent
now
setting
up
systems
to
monitor
all
these
viruses
and
to
generate
data
on
prototype
infections
in
each
of
these
families
,
he
says.In
other
words
,
no
amount
of
money
will
help
without
a
solid
platform
of
basic
science
to
build
on
.
The
extraordinary
success
of
the
COVID-19
vaccines
“
is
a
good
example
of
what
science
can
do
very
quickly
”
,
says
Iwasaki
,
“
but
it
didn
’
t
happen
overnight.

on
January
11
,
2020
,
research
and
collaboration
among
scientists
and
biopharmaceutical
manufacturers
quickly
followed.Various
methods
are
used
for
vaccine
discovery
and
manufacturing
.
As
of
May
5
,
2021
,
The
New
York
Times
Coronavirus
Vaccine
Tracker
lists
3
vaccines
authorized
for
emergency
use
in
the
United
States
.
Several
other
vaccines
are
approved
for
full
use
outside
the
United
States
,
and
27
vaccines
are
in
phase
3
clinical
trials
globally
.

Numerous
antiviral
medications
and
immunotherapies
are
under
investigation
for
coronavirus
disease
2019
(
COVID-19
)
.
The
US
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(
FDA
)
has
granted
emergency
use
authorizations
(
EUAs
)
for
3
SARS-CoV-2
vaccines
since
December
2020
.
Two
are
mRNA
vaccines
–
BNT-162b2
(
Pfizer
)
and
mRNA-1273
(
Moderna
)
,
whereas
the
third
is
a
viral
vector
vaccine
–
Ad26.COV2.S
(
Johnson
&
Johnson
)
.
Other
vaccines
are
in
or
nearing
phase
3
trials
.
Vaccination
of
older
adults
in
nursing
homes
began
in
January
2021
and
has
already
profoundly
reduced
severe
outcomes
and
hospitalizations
in
patients
at
higher
risk
,
including
older
adults
.
[

]
The
CDC
recommends
vaccination
for
individuals
who
have
already
had
COVID-19
and
recovered
.
Vaccinations
provide
a
safer
and
more
reliable
way
to
build
antibodies
compared
with
infection
.
Patients
may
receive
the
vaccine
once
they
have
recovered
from
the
acute
illness
(
if
symptomatic
)
and
meet
the
criteria
to
discontinue
isolation
.
Patients
who
received
monoclonal
antibodies
or
convalescent
plasma
should
wait
90
days
before
receiving
the
vaccine.Evidence
shows
vaccines
provide
substantially
higher
protection
against
COVID-19
infection
compared
with
immunity
from
a
previous
COVID-19
infection
.
mRNA
vaccinees
have
higher
antibody
titers
(
up
to
10
times
higher
)
than
convalescent
plasmas
from
donors
who
recovered
from
natural
infection
.
[

]
Early
studies
found
vaccination
of
patients
with
prior
SARS-CoV-2
infection
enhances
T-cell
immunity
and
antibody-secreting
memory
B-cell
response
,
and
neutralizing
antibodies
effective
against
emerging
variants
.
These
data
emphasize
the
importance
of
vaccinating
both
uninfected
and
previously
infected
persons
to
elicit
cross-variant
neutralizing
antibodies
.
[

,

,

In
the
United
States
,
vaccination
was
opened
to
all
aged
16
years
and
older
in
early
April
2021
.
On
May
10
,
2021
,
the
FDA
extended
the
EUA
for
the
BNT162b2
vaccine
(
Pfizer
)
to
include
younger
adolescents
aged
12-15
years
.
The
phase
3
trial
data
that
is
included
in
the
EUA
lists
the
vaccine
as
100
%
effective
in
preventing
SARS-CoV-2
infection
in
this
age
group
.
There
were
no
cases
of
COVID-19
disease
in
adolescents
aged
12-15
years
who
received
the
vaccine
(
n
=
1,119
)
compared
with
18
cases
in
those
who
received
placebo
(
n
=
1,110
)
.
The
mRNA-1273
vaccine
(
Moderna
)
was
reported
to
be
100
%
effective
14
days
after
receiving
2
doses
in
adolescents
aged
12-17
years
.
In
addition
,
vaccine
efficacy
of
93
%
in
seronegative
participants
was
observed
starting
14
days
after
the
first
dose
using
the
secondary
CDC
case
definition
of
COVID-19
,
which
tested
for
milder
disease
.
The
phase
2/3
trial
included
3,732
participants
.
An
EUA
was
submitted
June
10
,
2021
to
expanded
the
current
EUA
to
include
this
population
.
A
trial
for
NVX-CoV2373
(
Novavax
)
in
adolescents
aged
12-17
years
has
enrolled
2,248
participants
as
of
mid-June
2021
.
Clinical
trials
for
other
vaccines
are
ongoing
for
adolescents
and
children.In
addition
to
the
complexity
of
finding
the
most
effective
vaccine
candidates
,
the
production
process
is
also
important
for
manufacturing
the
vaccine
to
the
scale
needed
globally
.
Other
variables
that
increase
complexity
of
distribution
include
storage
requirements
(
eg
,
frozen
vs
refrigerated
)
and
whether
more
than
a
single
injection
is
required
for
optimal
immunity
.
Several
technological
methods
(
eg
,
DNA
,
RNA
,
inactivated
,
viral
vector
,
protein
subunit
)
are
available
for
vaccine
development
.
Vaccine
attributes
(
eg
,
number
of
doses
,
speed
of
development
,
scalability
)
depend
on
the
type
of
technological
method
employed
.
[

,

,

]
Some
methods
have
been
used
in
the
development
of
previous
vaccines
,
whereas
others
are
newly
developed
.
For
example
,
mRNA
vaccines
for
influenza
,
rabies
,
and
Zika
virus
have
been
previously
tested
in
animals

OverviewAZD-1222
(
ChAdOx1

;
AstraZeneca
)
is
a
replication-deficient
chimpanzee
adenoviral
vector
vaccine
containing
the
surface
glycoprotein
antigen
(
spike
protein
)
gene
.
It
is
administered
as
a
2-dose
series
28
days
apart
.
This
vaccine
primes
the
immune
system
by
eliciting
antibodies
to
attack
the
SARS-CoV-2
virus
if
it
later
infects
the
body
.
Owing
to
the
testing
of
a
different
coronavirus
vaccine
in
2019
,
development
for
AZD-1222
was
faster
than
that
of
other
viral
vector
vaccines.Results
of
an
interim
analysis
of
the
phase
3
clinical
trial
in
the
United
Kingdom
,
Brazil
,
and
South
Africa
are
as
follows
:
One
dosing
regimen
(
n
=
2741
)
showed
vaccine
efficacy
of
90
%
when
given
as
a
half
dose
,
followed
by
a
full
dose
at
least
1
month
later
.
Another
dosing
regimen
(
n
=
8895
)
showed
62.1
%
efficacy
when
given
as
2
full
doses
at
least
1
month
apart
.
The
combined
analysis
from
both
dosing
regimens
(
N
=
11,636
)
resulted
in
an
average
efficacy
of
70.4
%
(
p
<
.0001
for
all
)
.
From
21
days
after
the
first
dose
,
10
patients
in
the
control
arm
were
hospitalized
for
COVID-19
(
2
severe
,
1
death
)
.
[
21
]
Concerns
about
the
clinical
trial
implementation
and
data
analysis
have
emerged
because
the
half-dose
regimen
was
not
in
the
approved
study
design
.
[

]
These
concerns
will
be
addressed
by
regulatory
agencies
and
await
publication
of
the
trial
data
.
In
another
trial
,
researchers
studied
the
second
vaccine
dose
administered
at
3
months
after
the
first
dose
instead
of
at
1
month
.
After
the
initial
21-day
exclusion
period
,
there
were
no
hospitalizations
in
the
vaccine
group
compared
with
15
in
the
control
group
.
Vaccine
efficacy
after
a
single
standard
dose
of
vaccine
from
day
22
to
day
90
was
76
%
.
Modelled
analysis
indicated
that
protection
did
not
wane
during
the
initial
3-month
period
.
Similarly
,
antibody
levels
were
maintained
during
this
period
with
minimal
waning
by
day
90
.
In
the
group
that
received
2
doses
of
the
standard
dose
,
vaccine
efficacy
was
higher
with
a
longer
prime-boost
interval
(
3
months
)
compared
with
an
interval
less
than
6
weeks
(
82.4
%
vs
54.9
%
respectively
)
.
[

]
Nasal
swabs
were
obtained
from
trial
participants
every
week
in
the
UK
study
,
regardless
of
symptoms
.
This
allowed
assessment
of
the
overall
impact
of
the
vaccine
on
risk
for
infection
,
and
thus
a
surrogate
for
potential
onward
transmission
.
A
single
standard
dose
of
AZD-1222
reduced
PCR
positivity
by
67
%
,
and
after
the
second
dose
,
reduced
PCR
positivity
by
49.5
%
overall
.
These
data
indicate
that
ChAdOx1
nCoV-19
,
used
in
the
authorized
schedules
,
may
have
a
substantial
impact
on
transmission
by
reducing
the
number
of
infected
individuals
in
the
population
.

,
far
outweigh
the

are
likely
to
maintain

that
the
partial
resistance
of

could
render
some
individuals
less
well

supporting

However
,
a

93.4
%
with

to
87.9
%
for
the

variant
2
weeks
after
the
second
dose
.
[

Another
U.K.
analysis
found
single-dose
recipients
neutralizing
antibodies
are
significantly
lower
against
B.1.617.2
and
B.1.351
VOCs
relative
to
B.1.1.7
,
implying
that
although
a
single
dose
might
still
afford
considerably
more
protection
than
no
vaccination
,
single-dose
recipients
are
likely
to
be
less
protected
against
these
SARS-CoV-2

.
[

These
data
stress
the
importance
of
receiving
2

adhering
to
the
typical
regimen
of

approximately
3

mRNA-1273
vaccineSimilarly
,
the

,
just

month
later
,
decreased

a
factor
of
between
2.3
and
6.4
in
titers
of
neutralizing

against
the
tested
panel
of

The
largest
effect
on

,
reduction
by
a
factor
of
6.4
,
was
measured
against
the
B.1.351

Edra

estimated
the

,
to
be
6.8-fold
more
resistant
to

.
[
33
]
A
slight
decreased
neutralization
is
not
considered
to
be
clinically
significant
regarding
vaccine
efficacy
,

to
the
very
high
efficacy
of

According
to
data
from
the
CDC
,
pregnant
women
are
at
an
increased
risk
for
severe
illness
from
coronavirus
disease
2019
(
COVID-19
)
and
death
,
compared
with
nonpregnant
individuals
.
In
addition
,
pregnant
women
may
be
at
increased
risk
for
other
adverse
outcomes
(
eg
,
preterm
delivery
)
.
The
CDC
has
issued
Interim
Clinical
Considerations
for
Use
of
mRNA
COVID-19
Vaccines
,
which
discusses
the
limited
data
available
regarding
administration
to
pregnant
women
.
Owing
to
these
risks
,
preventing
severe
COVID-19
infection
is
essential
for
both
mother
and
fetus
.
A
cohort
study
(
n
=
131
)
by
Gray
et
al
found
mRNA
SARS-CoV-2
vaccines
generated
humoral
immunity
in
pregnant
and
lactating
women
,
similarly
to
that
observed
in
nonpregnant
women
.
All
serum
titers
from
vaccination
were
significantly
higher
compared
with
titers
induced
by
SARS-CoV-2
infection
during
pregnancy
(
p
<
0.0001
)
.
Importantly
,
vaccine-generated
antibodies
were
present
in
all
umbilical
cord
blood
and
breastmilk
samples
,
showing
immune
transfer
to
neonates
vial
placenta
and
breastmilk
.
[
39
]
In
another
study
,
maternal
and
cord
blood
sera
were
collected
from
20
parturients
who
received
2
doses
of
the
mRNA
BNT162b2
vaccine
.
All
women
and
infants
were
positive
for
anti
S-
and
Anti-RBD-specific
IgG
.
[
40
]
Additional
studies
support
the
above
findings
in
cord
blood
and
provide
further
information
regarding
potential
timing
of
maternal
vaccination
.
In
one
study
(
n
=
27
)
,
mean
placental
IgG
transfer
ratio
following
vaccination
(
mRNA
vaccines
)
provides
about
an
equal
in
infant
antibody
level
to
maternal
level
.
It
also
appears
to
increase
with
latency
from
vaccination
,
suggesting
that
earlier
vaccination
in
the
third
trimester
may
produce
greater
infant
immunity
.
[
41
]
A
similar
study
(
n
=
122
)
observed
women
vaccinated
with
mRNA
vaccines
lead
to
maternal
antibody
production
as
soon
as
5
days
after
the
first
dose
and
passive
immunity
to
the
neonate
as
soon
as
16
days
.
The
placental
IgG
transfer
ratio
increased
over
time

Researchers
studied

women
vaccinated
with

vaccines
after

.
mRNA
vaccines
induce
an
immune
response
through

,
which
has
been
linked
to
decidual
arteriopathy
,
growth
restriction
,
preterm

,
and
fetal

The
American
College
of
Obstetricians
and
Gynecologists
(
ACOG
)
has
issued
guidelines
regarding
vaccination
of
pregnant
and
lactating
patients
against
COVID-19
.
Key
points
from
these
guidelines
are
as
follows
:
Individuals
considering
COVID-19
vaccination
should
have
access
to
information
about
vaccine
safety
and
efficacy
,
including
information
about
data
that
are
not
available
.
A
conversation
between
the
patient
and
the
clinical
team
providing
care
may
assist
with
decisions
regarding
the
use
of
vaccines
approved
by
the
FDA
under
emergency
use
authorization
for
the
prevention
of
COVID-19
in
pregnant
patients
.
Important
considerations
include
:
Preliminary
findings
regarding
safety
of
mRNA
COVID-19
vaccines
in
pregnant
females
from
the
CDC
v-safe
registry
did
not
show
obvious
safety
signals
.
Additional
follow-up
,
including
women
vaccinated
earlier
in
pregnancy
is
needed
to
determine
maternal
,
pregnancy
,
and
infant
outcomes
.

detailsIn
the
eleven
months
elapsed
since
the
identification
of
the
SARS-CoV-2
virus
and
its
genome
,
an
exceptional
effort
by
the
scientific
community
has
led
to
the
development
of
over
300
vaccine
projects
.
Over
40
are
now
undergoing
clinical
evaluation
,
ten
of
these
are
in
Phase
III
clinical
trials
,
three
of
them
have
ended
Phase
III
with
positive
results
.
A
few
of
these
new
vaccines
are
being
approved
for
emergency
use
.
Existing
data
suggest
that
new
vaccine
candidates
may
be
instrumental
in
protecting
individuals
and
reducing
the
spread
of
pandemic
.
The
conceptual
and
technological
platforms
exploited
are
diverse
,
and
it
is
likely
that
different
vaccines
will
show
to
be
better
suited
to
distinct
groups
of
the
human
population
.
Moreover
,
it
remains
to
be
elucidated
whether
and
to
what
extent
the
capacity
of
vaccines
under
evaluation
and
of
unrelated
vaccines
such
as
BCG
can
increase
immunological
fitness
by
training
innate
immunity
to
SARS-CoV-2
and
pathogen-agnostic
protection
.
Due
to
the
short
development
time
and
the
novelty
of
the
technologies
adopted
,
these
vaccines
will
be
deployed
with
several
unresolved
issues
that
only
the
passage
of
time
will
permit
to
clarify
.
Technical
problems
connected
with
the
production
of
billions
of
doses
and
ethical
ones
connected
with
the
availably
of
these
vaccines
also
in
the
poorest
countries
,
are
imminent
challenges
facing
us
.
It
is
our
tenet
that
in
the
long
run
more
than
one
vaccine
will
be
needed
to
ensure
equitable
global
access
,
protection
of
diverse
subjects
and
immunity
against
viral
variants.The
COVID-19
outbreak
has
prompted
scientists
from
around
the
world
to
design
anti-SARS-CoV-2
vaccines.The
free
availability
of
basic
science
data
has
allowed
creating
vaccines
based
on
very
innovative
platforms
and
directed
towards
very
well
defined
sensible
targets.High
financial
support
both
from
private
consortia
and
the
governments
of
several
nations
have
made
it
possible
to
develop
the
new
vaccines
extremely
quickly.The
possibility
of
having
numerous
vaccines
based
on
different
technologies
will
allow
us
to
select
those
that
can
be
most
effective
in
specific
phases
of
the
pandemic
and
different
parts
of
the
world.The
production
and
distribution
of
billions
of
doses
of
COVID-19
vaccines
is
the
new
,
difficult
challenge.The
creative
and
technological
effort
that
lead
to
the
development
of
COVID-19
vaccines
has
changed
the
way
of
thinking
and
designing
new
vaccines
for
other
diseases.Will
the
new
vaccines
be
able
to
control
the
COVID-19
pandemic
?
Will
there
be
vaccines
that
will
be
able
to
protect
the
most
fragile
sections
of
the
human
population
?
The
development
of
vaccines
in
a
very
short
time
necessarily
implies
that
is
not
yet
possible
to
know
their
long-term
efficacy
and
possible
side
effects.Will
it
be
possible
to
overcome
financial
and
political
problems
and
allow
COVID-19
vaccines
to
be
available
with
equity
for
the
entire
population
of
the
world
?
The
hope
and
hype
that
the
media
and
public
at
large
are
placing
on
having
as
soon
as
possible
a
vaccine
that
protects
against
COVID-19
is
the
result
of
the
great
triumphs
that
vaccines
have
had
and
are
having
in
the
control
of
infectious
diseases
.
However
,
there
is
a
long
series
of
infectious
diseases
in
which
vaccines
are
only
partially
effective
and
we
have
a
series
of
sensational
vaccine
defeats
[
1
]
.
Indeed
,
each
disease
is
an
immunological
problem
in
itself
:
even
today
,
with
all
the
data
at
one
’
s
disposal
,
it
is
difficult
to
predict
what
kind
of
vaccine
can
be
truly
effective
.
This
difficulty
is
even
greater
for
COVID-19
,
a
new
disease
in
which
ongoing
studies
in
laboratories
worldwide
are
adding
new
data
at
a
tremendous
pace
.
SARS-CoV2
,
the
coronavirus
responsible
for
COVID-19
is
an
RNA
virus
,
and
these
viruses
generally
have
a
high
mutation
rate
.
Genetic
instability
has
long
been
considered
to
represent
a
challenge
to
develop
effective
vaccines
against
RNA
viruses.In
many
cases
,
recovery
from
a
viral
disease
rests
on
the
combined
action
of
antibodies
in
the
biological
fluids
that
neutralize
the
viral
particles
and
the
killer
activity
of
lymphocytes
that
track
down
and
kill
virus-infected
cells
.
However
,
there
are
viral
diseases
whose
healing
depends
mainly
,
if
not
exclusively
,
on
the
antibody
response
and
others
where
the
destructive
action
of
the
killer
lymphocytes
is
fundamental
.
What
is
the
case
with
COVID-19
is
not
yet
clearly
defined
although
several
data
suggest
that
the
major
protective
effect
is
to
be
attributed
to
antibodies
against
the
Spike
protein
and
in
particular
against
its
receptor-binding
domain
.
Often
,
healed
patients
display
high
titers
of
SARS-CoV-2
neutralizing
antibodies
[
2
]
.
Data
on
the
role
of
mucosal
immunity
and
secretory
IgA
and
IgM
are
scarce
.
Furthermore
,
we
can
not
yet
know
how
long
the
protection
acquired
by
recovered
patients
will
last
.
This
point
is
of
interest
since
often
,
the
duration
of
the
protection
after
healing
somewhat
corresponds
to
the
duration
of
the
protection
provided
by
the
vaccine.Despite
the
impressive
amount
of
studies
carried
out
since
the
virus
was
first
characterized
,
there
are
still
a
large
number
of
unknowns
about
this
disease
.
And
it
is
precisely
these
unknowns
that
fully
justify
the
very
different
conceptual
and
technological
strategies
that
are
currently
pursued
in
the
preparation
of
vaccines
against
COVID-19
.
This
diversification
appeared
essential
precisely
because
,
for
many
diseases
,
but
particularly
for
a
new
disease
as
COVD-19
,
it
is
difficult
to
predict
which
type
of
immune
response
and
therefore
vaccine
will
be
more
effective.As
shown
by
Lurie
et
al
.
[
3
]
,
there
are
major
differences
between
traditional
vaccine
development
and
development
under
the
pressure
of
a
rampant
epidemic
.
Because
of
the
pressure
created
by
the
pandemic
,
multiple
activities
are
carried
at
financial
risks
,
without
knowing
whether
the
candidate
vaccine
will
be
safe
and
effective
,
including
very
early
manufacturing
and
scale-up
to
commercial
scale
before
the
establishment
of
clinical
proof
of
concept
.
However
,
in
many
cases
,
the
financial
risk
is
mainly
being
taken
by
Public
Institutions
and
Governments
which
provide
financial
support
to
companies
in
their
development
effort.As
of
December
2020
,
just
eleven
months
after
the
definition
of
the
SARS-CoV-2
genome
,
there
are
over
150
official
vaccine
projects
[
4
,
5
]
.
About
fifty
of
them
have
already
reached
human
experimentation
and
a
few
of
these
are
currently
administered
to
some
sectors
of
the
general
population
.
By
exploiting
different
technologies
,
these
anti-SARS-CoV-2
candidate
vaccines
are
targeting
the
whole
SARS-CoV-2
,
molecules
or
fragments
of
molecules
expressed
on
this
virus
surface
.
These
different
candidate
vaccines
can
be
grouped
based
on
the
technological
platform
exploited
to
elicit
a
protective
immune
response
.
However
,
almost
every
vaccine
project
has
its
peculiarities
that
make
it
unique
and
which
could
have
significant
consequences
regarding
the
efficacy
or
duration
of
the
induced
protection
or
the
safety
of
the
vaccine
.
In

and

of

vaccine
projects
that
are
currently
in
Phase
III
trial
are
shown.COVID-19
vaccines

on
the

inactivated
SARS-CoV-2.Faced
with
this
variety
of
projects
and
the
determination
and
speed
with
which
they
are
carried
out
,
one
can
not
help
but
be
amazed
by
human
scientific
creativity
.
Even
if
these
various
projects
compete
with
each
other
and
have
their
technical
secrets
,
their
formulation
comes
from
basic
scientific
research
that
is
structured
as
open
cooperation
between
all
laboratories
in
the
world
.
Indeed
,
the
numerous
freely
available
basic
research
data
on
the
mechanisms
of
SARS-CoV-2
infection
have
convinced
most
developers
of
innovative
vaccine
to
focus
their
efforts
on
inducing
an
immune
response
against
the
Spike
protein
(
Fig
.
2
)
.
The
new
data
emerging
from
Phase
III
studies
show
that
vaccines
based
on
nucleic
acids
coding
for
the
Spike
protein
,
carried
by
liposomes
or
adenoviruses
,
can
elicit
an
effective
protective
response
[
6,7,8,9
]
.
These
four
impressive
press
releases
provide
the
first
evidence
that
vaccines
based
on
previously
unproven
technologies
can
significantly
contribute
to
the
control
of
a
pandemic
that
to
date
has
caused
more
than
1.5
million
deaths
[
10
]
.Within
a
few
months
after
the
identification
of
the
new
SARS-CoV-2
,
the
freely
available
data
made
by
numerous
laboratories
around
the
world
provided
a
defined
picture
of
the
virus
structure
and
of
the
steps
of
human
cell
infection
.
A
SARS-CoV-2
is
an
oily
spherical
particle
containing
a
single-stranded
positive-sense
RNA
of
about
30
kb
wrapped
and
coiled
by
the
Nucleocapsid
protein
.
The
virus
outer
shell
consists
of
three
other
structural
glycoproteins
:
Spike
,
Envelope
,
and
Membrane
,
and
a
lipid
coating
.
On
the
surface
of
SARS-CoV-2
,
three
Spike
glycoproteins
aggregate
protrudes
outside
the
pericapsid
and
may
interact
at
a
high
affinity
with
Angiotensin-Converting
Enzyme
2
(
ACE2
)
,
an
exopeptidase
normally
present
on
the
outer
surface
of
a
wide
variety
of
human
cells
.
B
The
Spike
protein
consists
of
two
domains
,
S1
and
S2
.
In
the
most
external
domain
,
a
region
known
as
Receptor-Binding
Domain
(
RBD
)
,
allows
the
high-affinity
binding
of
the
SARS-CoV-2
to
the
N-terminal
domain
of
the
ACE2
.
The
progressive
elucidation
of
the
critical
role
of
this
interaction
provided
the
key
insights
that
spurred
several
developers
of
innovative
vaccine
to
target
the
Spike
protein
and
its
RBD
[
2
,
66
]
.
The
recent
reports
on
the
protective
efficacy
of
vaccines
based
on
different
platforms
targeting
the
Spike
protein
[
6,7,8,9
]
suggest
that
the
freely
available
basic
science
data
allowed
to
make
a
winning
bet
[
10
]
.It
will
be
important
to
compare
the
intensity
and
duration
of
the
protective
responses
elicited
by
these
four
vaccines
with
those
induced
by
vaccines
based
on
technological
platforms
that
are
slower
to
develop
.
Other
vaccine
candidates
that
are
coming
might
work
better
than
the
first
,
provide
a
longer
immunity
,
while
other
factors
such
as
cost
or
side
effects
might
offer
benefits
to
specific
groups
,
such
as
the
elderly
,
pregnant
women
,
or
people
in
low-income
countries
[
11
,

]
.The
history
of
vaccination
begins
with
vaccines
based
on
a
living
microbe
that
has
been
weakened
so
it
can
not
cause
disease
.
Since
attenuated
microbes
retain
the
ability
to
replicate
in
vivo
giving
rise
to
a
limited
disease
,
they
are
very
effective
in
stimulating
the
immune
system
and
inducing
a
strong
and
persistent
immune
memory
that
is
efficacious
in
preventing
infection
.
Hundreds
of
millions
of
people
have
been
protected
from
disabling
and
fatal
diseases
by
using
attenuated
vaccines
[
1
]
.This
is
the
most
traditional
technology
exploited
in
the
construction
of
vaccines
.
Live
attenuated
vaccines
can
be
obtained
by
growing
the
virus
in
unfavorable
conditions
or
by
generating
a
genetically
weakened
version
of
the
virus
.
However
,
the
attenuation
of
trillions
of
viruses
is
complex
and
delicate
and
can
be
associated
with
major
biosafety
risks
[
13
]
.
Once
produced
,
their
storage
and
handling
require
carefully
observed
procedures.The
experience
with
attenuated
virus
vaccines
shows
that
rare
but
significant
side
effects
could
be
expected
since
attenuated
viruses
cause
disease
,
even
if
this
is
a
minor
one
.
The
oral
route
(
as
in
the
case
of
the
Sabin
polio
vaccine
)
and
the
intranasal
route
could
induce
a
mucosal
immunity
based
on
secretory
IgA
and
IgM.Only
three
projects
of
attenuated
SARS-CoV-2
vaccines
are
in
active
preclinical
development
at
the
following
institutions
:
The
Serum
Inst
of
India
,
India
,
in
collaboration
with
Codagenix
,
a
New
York
private
biotech
;
Indian
Immunologicals
Ltd
,
India
,
in
collaboration
with
the
Griffith
University
,
Australia
;
Mehmet
Ali
Aydunar
Univ
,
Turkey.None
of
these
vaccine
projects
have
yet
reached
the
stage
of
clinical
trials.Vaccines
based
on
killed
microorganisms
(
inactivated
vaccines
)
belong
to
a
very
traditional
technological
platform
that
has
led
to
numerous
vaccines
.
The
vaccines
produced
using
this
method
are
more
stable
than
live
attenuated
vaccines
but
their
limit
is
mainly
related
to
the
short
duration
of
immune
memory
which
demands
inoculation
of
higher
amounts
of
vaccine
or
the
association
of
the
inactivated
microorganism
with
an
adjuvant
.
The
immune
response
elicited
is
directed
not
only
against
the
Spike
protein
but
also
against
many
other
SARS-CoV-2
antigens
.
While
the
induced
response
is
generally
weaker
concerning
that
induced
by
attenuated
viruses
,
the
vaccine
is
more
easily
handled
,
less
expensive
,
and
much
safer.The
SARS-CoV-2
is
inactivated
by
exploiting
different
chemical
techniques
.
All
these
candidate
vaccines
are
injected
intramuscularly.Seven
vaccine
candidates
based
on
variously
inactivated
SARS-CoV-2
virions
are
in
clinical
trials
,
four
of
which
in
Phase
III
trials
and
already
approved
for
limited
use
(
Fig
.
1
)
.
When
available
,
reports
from
Phase
II
trials
suggest
that
the
vaccine
is
safe
and
induces
a
high
titer
of
antibodies
.
The
seven
clinical
trials
are
run
by
:
Sinovac
Biotech
,
China
,
this
vaccine
called
CoronaVac
is
in
late-stage
Phase
III
trial
and
interim
results
are
expected
in
late
November
.
Meanwhile
,
CoronaVac
has
already
been
approved
for
limited
use
among
the
general
population
(
Fig
.
1
)
;
Sinopharm
,
China
,
two
of
its
distinct
projects
are
approved
for
limited
use

the
general
population

been

the
general
population
(

)
;
Chinese
Acad
Med
Sci
,
China
;
Bharat
Biotech
,
India
,
this
vaccine
,
called
Covaxin
,
is
in
late
stage
Phase
III
trial
;
RIBSP
,
Kazakhstan.There
are
several
human
vaccines
based
on
proteins
present
on
the
surface
of
microbes
[
1
]
.
Initially
,
these
proteins
were
purified
from
the
microbes
while
today
,
in
most
of
the
cases
,
they
are
produced
in
vitro
exploiting
the
recombinant
DNA
technology.The
large
trimeric
aggregates
of
the
Spike
protein
that
protrude
outside
the
virion
play
an
essential
role
in
the
docking
of
the
SARS-CoV-2
to
human
cells
.
Therefore
,
the
Spike
protein
or
its
fragments
are
the
targets
of
all
these
vaccines
even
if
in
a
few
cases
other
SARS-CoV-2
proteins
-mostly
the
nucleoprotein
(
N
)
-
are
also
targeted
.
To
activate
a
robust
immune
response
,
often
these
vaccines
exploit
adjuvants
,
either
of
bacterial
or
synthetic
origin.There
are
very
numerous
vaccine
projects
based
on
SARS-CoV-2
proteins
,
their
fragments
,
or
their
fragments
combination
.
At
least
sixteen
candidate
vaccines
are
already
in
human
trials
and
two
in
Phase
II
trial
(
Fig
.
3
)
:
These
vaccines
are
probably
the
most
immunogenic
also
thanks
to
the
combination
with
new
adjuvants
[
14
]
.
The
exploitation
of
transgenic
plants
as
producers
of
Spike
protein
could
allow
the
production
of
large
quantities
of
the
vaccine
at
an
extremely
low
cost.Spike

Currently
,
there
are
no
DNA
vaccines
registered
for
human
use
;
however
,
DNA
vaccines
are
commonly
used
in
veterinary
medicine
.
These

are
stable

can
easily
be
produced
in
large
amounts
in
bacteria.Once
injected

of

,
the

is
carried

.
Also
,
in
the
case
of

,
the
target
antigen
coded
by
the
mRNA
is
mostly
if

,
represented
by
the

,
its

included
1077
patients
randomized
to
an
irrelevant
meningococcus
vaccine
or
the
adenovirus-based
SARS-CoV2
vaccine
[

.
Selected
common
findings
include
:
activation
of
innate
immunity
,
as
revealed
by
local
and
systemic
inflammation
;
induction
of
antibodies
,
including
neutralizing
antibodies
;
induction
of
type
1T
cell
responses
with
Interferon-gamma
production
.
Type
1
immune
responses
are
considered
a
cornerstone
of
antiviral
immunity
.
At
least
in
the
most
extensive
study
,
the
AstraZeneca
vaccine
trial
,
induction
of
type
2
potentially
deleterious
T
cell
responses
were
not
observed
.
Collectively
,
these
results
are
encouraging
but
suffer
from
limitations
,
extensively
discussed
in
some
of
the
reports
[
16
]
.
Follow-up
was
limited
(
<
60
days
)
and
the
duration
of
persistence
of
immunological
memory
remains
to
be
determined
.
The
actual
significance
of
immunological
parameters
for
protection
remains
to
be
defined
.
Aging
is
associated
with
loss
of
immunological
memory
,
reduced
repertoire
of
responses
,
and
increased
inflammatory
tone
[
22
]
.
As
a
consequence
,
for
instance
,
vaccines
designed
for
the
elderly
have
been
introduced
for
influenza
.
Therefore
,
it
appears
of
particular
interest
that
in
a
randomized
Phase
2/3
trial
enrolling
560
participants
of
which
240
were
aged
70
years
or
older
,
the
Oxford/AstraZeneca
vaccine
was
able
to
elicit
an
effective
production
of
SARS-CoV-2
neutralizing
antibodies
and
to
elicit
T
cell-mediated
reactivity
in
all
vaccinated
participants
,
even
in
adults
over
70
years
of
age
.
Indeed
,
the
volunteers
of
this
age
group
showed
a
reduced
reactogenicity
[
17

.
Moreover
,
to
assist
with
the
interpretation
of
the
data
,
the
full
details
of
this
trial
operation
procedure
have
been
made
available
[

.
A
Phase
1
randomized
trial
enrolling
195
participants
to
compare
the
immunogenicity
and
reactivity
of
Pfizer
-
BioNTech
liposome-mRNA
vaccines
(
BNT162b1
and
BNT162b2
)
both
vaccine
candidates
elicited
similar
dose-dependent
SARS-CoV-2
antibody
titers
in
young
adults
and
those
between
65
and
85
years
of
age
[
23
]
.
In
a
Phase
I
dose-escalation
trial
,
the
Moderna
mRNA-1273
liposome
-
mRNA
vaccine
administered
to
40
older
adults
who
were
stratified
according
to
age
(
56–70
and
over
70
)
elicited
titers
of
neutralizing
antibody
similar
to
those
previously
reported
among
vaccine
recipients
between
the
ages
of
18
and
55
years
[
24
]
.An
interim
analysis
of
ongoing
large
Phase
2/3
trials
in
UK
and
Brazil
confirmed
that
the
Oxford/AstraZeneca
vaccine
has
an
acceptable
safety
profile
.
In
the
participants
enrolled
in
the
UK
and
Brazil
who
received
the
vaccine
standard
dose
,
consistently
vaccine
efficacy
was
62
%
.
By
contrast
,
in
a
subset
of
participants
in
the
UK
trial
who
received
a
half
vaccine
dose
as
their
first
dose
and
a
standard
dose
as
their
booster
dose
,
vaccine
efficacy
was
90
%
[
25
]
.
Despite
the
enthusiasm
for
this
finding
,
which
puts
the
Oxford/AstraZeneca
vaccine
at
the
efficacy
level
of
those
of
Pfizer-BioNTech
and
Moderna
(
Fig
.
4
)
the
interpretation
of
this
results
ore
not
yet
established
.
It
is
not
uncommon
that
different
doses
between
the
first
and
second
vaccination
may
potentiate
the
intensity
of
the
induced
immune
response
.
Alternatively
,
a
lower
first
dose
of
the
vaccine
may
not
elicit
a
strong
reaction
against
the
chimpanzee
adenovirus
(
Fig
.
5
)
.
In
the
absence
of
a
strong
antibody
response
,
the
adenovirus
could
more
effectively
deliver
the
mRNA
during
the
booster
vaccination
.
This
is
also
the
rationale
for
the
Sputnik
V
vaccine
,
which
uses
a
different
type
of
adenovirus
in
the
first
vaccination
and
the
booster
injection
[

]
.
These
puzzling
data
are
spurring
the
UK
vaccine
task
force
to
plan
a
“
mix
and
match
”
trial
that
will
combine
both
the
Oxford/AstraZeneca
and
the
Pfizer-BionTHech
vaccine
to
evaluate
if
the
two
vaccines
together
produce
a
stronger
immune
response
The
two
vaccines
may
trigger
slightly
different
immune
responses
that
could
mutually
enhance
each
other

.Vaccine
reactogenicity
refers
to
a
subset
of
inflammatory
reactions
that
occur
soon
after
vaccination
.
While
no
safety
concerns
appear
to
be
related
to
the
administration
of
Pfizer
–
BioNTech
,
Moderna
,
Oxford/AstraZeneca
,
and

vaccine
administration
,
the
frequency
of
inflammatory
reactions
is
higher
than
that
commonly
observed
with
flu
vaccines
[

.
Of
the
two
candidate
vaccines
initially
tested
by
Pfizer
–
BioNThec
,
the
BNT162b1
coding
for
the
Receptor-Binding
Domain
(
RBD
)
of
the
Spike
protein
(
see
Fig

)
was
dismissed
since
it
was
more
reactogenic
than
the
BNT162b2
coding
for
the
entire
Spike
protein
[
23
,
30
,

]
.
In
the
AstraZeneca
trials
,
the
ChAdOx1
candidate
vaccine
induced
a
similar
immune
response
across
all
age
groups
,
while
it
was
less
reactogenic
in
older
adults
than
in
younger
adults
[

.
Early
markers
for
reactogenicity
,
including
the
humoral
innate
immunity
molecule
PTX3
,
may
help
early
assessment
of
activation
of
innate
immunity
and
reactogenicity
[

COVID-19
has
been
associated
in
a
fraction
of
patients
with
the
development
of
autoimmune
reactions
blocking
the
Interferon
pathway
or
eliciting
thrombosis
[
32,33,34
]
.
Although
there
have
been
no
major
problems
in
patients
suffering
from
autoimmune
disorders
,
further
studies
are
needed
to
assess
the
impact
of
COVID-19
and
vaccines
on
autoimmunity
including
myasthenia
gravis
[
35
,
36
]
.Even
if
incomplete
,
the
list
of
ongoing
clinical
trials
shown
above
gives
an
idea
of
the
grandiose
scientific
,
technical
,
and
organizational
effort
that
is
currently
underway
.
The
administration
of
the
new
vaccine
makes
it
possible
to
understand
whether
the
vaccine
induces
a
significant
immune
response
and
whether
its
administration
causes
clear
adverse
events
.
The
candidate
vaccines
which
are
considered
worthy
of
study
in
complex
Phase
III
human
trials
are
the
ones
that
,
on
a
limited
number
of
volunteers
in
Phase
I
and
II
clinical
trials
,
caused
minor
short-term
side
effects
while
inducing
a
good
production
of
antibodies
capable
of
neutralizing
the
infectivity
of
SARS-CoV-2
(
neutralizing
antibodies
)
,
and
,
in
some
cases
,
a
significant
T
cell
activation
.
Even
if
the
assays
to
evaluate
the
immune
response
vary
vastly
,
protein-based
vaccines
appear
to
elicit
the
strongest
antibody
response
[
14
]
.The
real
evaluation
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
new
vaccine
is
based
on
Phase
III
randomized
controlled
trials
that
compare
the
incidence
of
COVID-19
in
large
groups
of
vaccinated
and
non-vaccinated
people
.
This
evaluation
will
determine
whether
one
,
several
or
none
of
the
new
COVID-19
vaccines
protects
effectively
or
only
marginally
and
if
its
administration
is
associated
with
important
collateral
events
.
The
situation
may
arise
where
the
scientific
efforts
and
the
huge
funding
investments
will
result
in
the
development
of
fifteen
or
more
frontrunners
that
will
be
registered
for
general
use
and
compete
head-to-head.-Mirror

the

all
?
Data
from
Phase
III
studies
will
provide
an
excellent
indication
of
the
efficacy
,
limits
,
and
safety
of
the
candidate
vaccines
.
However
,
only
a
few
of
the
long
list
of
vaccines
will
be
directly
compared
.
The
WHO
has
put
forward
Solidarity
efficacy
trials
open
to
vaccines
from
every
country
and
has
made
public
detailed
criteria
on
how
to
prioritize
vaccine
efficacy
[
37
]
.
The
vaccines
included
in
Operation
Warp
Speed
,
the
US
government
’
s
private-public
partnership
to
support
COVID-19
vaccines
,
have
harmonized
efficacy
protocols
to
streamline
oversight
and
run
immunological
analyses
in
central
labs
for
achieving
a
direct
data
comparison
[
38
]
.
But
what
about
all
the
other
projects
?
Although
any
vaccine
that
will
be
registered
in
Europe
and
the
USA
will
be
assessed
on
a
long
series
of
data
for
its
efficacy
and
safety
,
it
will
likely
be
a
long
time
before
industrial
policies
and
national
political
issues
could
allow
a
solid
comparative
assessment
of
the
efficacy
of
the
various
vaccines
.
Quantitative
comparisons
of
the
efficacy
of
different
vaccines
in
inducing
immune
responses
are
hampered
by
the
lack
of
international
standards
.
For
instance
,
there
is
no
international
standard
at
the
moment
for
titrating
IgG
anti-Spike
serum
antibodies
,
let
alone
for
neutralization
assays
or
T
cell
responses
.
This
current
technological
limitation
makes
it
difficult
to
compare
immune
responses
elicited
by
vaccines
in
different
trials.It
is
also
conceivable
that
“
the
best
”
COVID-19
vaccine
could
not
exist
at
all
,
as
vaccines
developed
on
distinct
technological
platforms
could
induce
different
forms
of
immunity
,
each
of
them
appropriate
in
different
environmental
and
human
contexts
.
The
polio
vaccine
provides
an
interesting
example
.
The
injectable
killed
Salk
vaccine
is
turning
out
to
be
appropriate
for
the
industrialized
world
:
it
is
safe
and
effective
in
areas
of
the
world
where
polio
no
longer
exists
.
By
contrast
,
the
attenuated
Sabin
vaccine
,
more
effective
and
easier
to
be
administered
orally
,
is
appropriate
for
the
developing
world
where
the
wild
virus
is
still
circulating
.
Thus
,
the
evolution
of
the
pandemic
could
make
some
vaccines
more
appropriate
in
different
geographic
contexts
or
for
different
clusters
(
e.g.
,
infants
,
elderly
)
of
the
human
population
[
39
]
.
It
is
quite
possible
that
the
sequential
arrival
of
subsequent
wages
of
vaccines
could
increase
and
make
more
appropriate
the
protection
initially
induced
by
the
first
vaccines.It
is
expected
that
the
first
vaccines
that
will
be
made
available
will
significantly
contribute
to
the
normalization
of
social
life
,
even
if
their
arrival
will
be
accompanied
by
a
long
list
of
unknowns
.
Most
of
these
unknowns
are
inherently
associated
with
the
dramatic
pressure
brought
on
by
the
pandemic
and
the
reactive
speed
at
which
these
vaccines
are
being
developed
.
The
passage
of
time
along
with
the
luxury
of
being
able
to
develop
more
detailed
studies
will
lead
to
the
clarification
of
many
questions
left
open
by
the
first
Phase
III
studies.Only
time
will
tell
how
long
the
vaccine-elicited
protection
will
last
and
how
frequent
the
booster
injections
should
be
administered
to
keep
the
protection
fully
active
.
Over
time
,
population
data
will
better
clarify
what
kind
of
protection
the
various
vaccines
can
induce
.
Will
the
vaccine
protect
people
only
from
the
mildest
form
of
COVID-19
,
or
will
it
be
one
that
prevents
serious
complications
and
reduces
mortality
?
Often
Phase
III
trials
are
designed
to
test
whether
the
vaccines
reduce
cases
of
symptomatic
COVID-19
,
not
cases
of
severe
diseases
,
such
as
those
that
require
hospitalization
and
can
end
in
death
[
40
]
.Who
will
be
protected
is
another
crucial
question
that
only
more
detailed
studies
can
answer
.
Phase
III
trials
currently
underway
are
mainly
focused
on
a
healthy
population
.
A
vaccine
judged
to
be
effective
on
this
population
may
not
work
equally
well
in
elderly
individuals
,
frail
,
and
other
at-risk
persons
.
Even
if
children
are
not
a
high-risk
group
,
as
the
schools
reopen
,
the
transmission
of
the
virus
could
take
place
among
students
,
their
parents
,
and
school
staff
[
41
]
.
Vaccinating
children
could
help
reopen
society
,
ensuring
that
schools
do
not
become
hot
spots
.
Current
trials
,
such
as
the
AstraZeneca
phase
III
in
the
USA
now
include
children
.
Pregnant
women
are
another
high-risk
group
since
they
have
a
higher
risk
of
being
admitted
to
an
intensive
care
unit
and
of
requiring
mechanical
ventilation
[
42
]
.
Will
the
vaccines
also
be
able
to
prevent
the
spread
of
the
disease
?
In
effect
,
while
protecting
from
the
clinical
disease
vaccines
might
not
reduce
virus
transmission
[
43
]
.
Among
many
other
unknowns
that
can
be
solved
over
time
,
there
is
the
question
of
whether
the
arrival
of
vaccines
will
be
able
to
create
the
herd
immunity
capable
of
controlling
the
spread
of
SARS-CoV-2
[
44
]
.
Complex
social
policy
issues
and
the
acceptance
or
rejection
of
vaccination
by
the
population
will
significantly
affect
the
possibility
of
achieving
this
crucial
goal.The
administration
of
a
new
vaccine
must
always
be
carefully
associated
with
a
rigorous
study
of
its
safety
.
This
is
particularly
important
because
a
vaccine
is
not
a
drug
for
sick
people
at
risk
of
dying
,
but
rather
a
treatment
that
is
given
to
those
who
are
well
to
prevent
the
risk
of
falling
ill
[
1
]
.The
race
to
develop
a
COVID-19
vaccine
is
not
only
justified
but
necessary
.
However
,
the
time
required
to
evaluate
the
dangers
and
risks
that
may
arise
from
a
new
vaccine
must
be
included
in
its
development
.
In
some
cases
,
vaccines
prepared
against
other
coronaviruses
or
other
viruses
have
worsened
the
disease
[
45
]
and
have
induced
T
helper
2-type
immunopathology
[
46
]
.
These
issues
must
be
carefully
evaluated
and
excluded
before
a
new
COVID-19
vaccine
is
distributed
to
combat
the
pandemic
or
its
subsequent
outbreaks
.
These
basic
considerations
take
on
special
importance
when
inappropriate
political
pressures
may
lead
to
accelerating
the
evaluation
of
vaccine
safety
.
Claiming
to
have
won
the
race
to
develop
a
COVID-19
vaccine
or
the
distribution
of
a
candidate
vaccine
to
clusters
of
the
population
before
all
data
from
clinical
trials
are
obtained
and
carefully
analyzed
can
be
dangerous
and
erode
trust
in
both
the
vaccine
and
regulatory
bodies
.
In
this
weird
contest
,
the
pledges
put
forward
both
by
pharmaceutical
companies
and
the
director
of
the
US
Objective
Warp
Speed
[
13
]
to
keep
rigorous
efficacy
and
safety
standards
as
an
absolutely
central
issue
in
COVID-19
vaccine
development
are
reassuring.At
the
time
of
writing
,
there
are
over
5000
complete
sequencing
data
of
viral
isolates
reported
,
and
at
least
three
peer-reviewed
papers
available
[
47,48,49
]
.
SARS-CoV-2
is
relatively
stable
and
no
evidence
has
been
obtained
that
an
attenuated
virus
has
spread
globally
.
For
instance
,
sequencing
of
346
virus
isolates
in
the
Lombardy
region
has
shown
that
the
spike
protein
does
not
undergo
mutations
including
at
glycosylation
sites
.
The
relative
stability
of
SARS-CoV-2
,
unlike
HIV
,
provides
a
strong
rationale
for
vaccine
development
.
However
,
following
the
introduction
of
an
effective
vaccine
(
s
)
,
the
mutant
virus
may
appear
and
have
a
selective
advantage
,
thus
posing
the
issue
of
adapting
the
vaccine
strategy.There
is
strong
evidence
that
selected
vaccines
confer
what
has
been
referred
to
as
pathogen-agnostic
protection
against
infectious
agents
unrelated
to
the
one
specifically
targeted
[
50,51,52,53
]
.For
instance
,
the
measles
and
BCG
vaccines
are
strongly
associated
with
a
reduced
incidence
of
unrelated
respiratory
tract
infections
[
54
]
.
The
mechanisms
of
pathogen-agnostic
protection
are
complex
and
include
avoidance
of
virus-induced
immunosuppression
and
increased
effectiveness
(
“
training
”
)
of
innate
immunity
.
The
evidence
for
pathogen-agnostic
protection
and
training
of
innate
immunity
is
strong
for
BCG
[
52
]
.
Moreover
,
it
has
been
speculated
that
the
intense
vaccination
calendar
for
children
contributes
to
their
as
yet
unexplained
resistance
to
COVID-19
.
Based
on
these
considerations
several
prospective
clinical
trials
are
ongoing
aimed
to
assess
the
value
of
BCG
for
instance
for
the
protection
of
health
care
workers
.
At
this
stage
,
usage
of
BCG
as
a
preventive
measure
against
COVID-19
can
not
be
recommended
outside
of
clinical
trials
[
52
]
.
However
,
available
information
suggests
that
vaccines
such
as
influenza
,
pneumococcus
,
and
herpes
in
the
elderly
represent
a
general
training
strategy
for
innate
and
adaptive
immunity
.
Moreover
,
it
will
be
important
to
assess
whether
anti-SARS-CoV-2
vaccines
increase
immunological
fitness
as
this
may
be
relevant
to
fight
escape
variants.Once
the
new
vaccine
has
been
validated
,
subsequent
problems
will
be
related
to
its
production
and
distribution
.
Technological
,
organizational
,
regulatory
,
and
economic
problems
will
have
to
be
overcome
.
The
industrial
technology
needed
to
scale
up
the
production
to
a
billion
doses
will
depend
on
which
kind
of
vaccine
will
work
best
.
Initially
,
it
might
not
be
physically
possible
to
make
enough
vaccines
for
the
world
’
s
population
,
although
,
various
vaccines
are
already
in
production
without
being
sure
that
they
will
be
registered
and
distributed
.
Besides
,
political
and
economic
constraints
may
limit
vaccine
access
to
the
country
that
produces
it
or
to
the
countries
that
can
afford
to
pay
for
it
.
To
make
the
new
vaccines
available
to
the
global
population
will
be
challenging
[
55
]
.
The
problem
of
a
fair
distribution
of
the
vaccine
in
all
the
nations
of
the
world
is
much
discussed
and
various
initiatives
are
about
to
be
implemented
by
several
nations
and
international
organizations
[
14
,

]
.
To
ensure
equitable
access
to
future
COVID-19
vaccines
the
Coalition
for
Epidemic
Preparedness
Innovations
(
CEPI
)
,
The
Global
Alliance
for
Vaccines
and
Immunization
(
GAVI
)
,
and
WHO
have
launched
the
COVID-19
Vaccines
Global
Access
(
COVAX
)
Facility
,
a
global
risk-sharing
mechanism
for
pooled
procurement
and
equitable
distribution
of
eventual
COVID-19
vaccines
[

]
.The
enthusiasm
to
design
different
COVID-19
vaccines
is
also
plaguing
the
biohacking
community
.
Biohacking
is
a
“
do-it-yourself
biology
”
,
a
somewhat
romantic
biotechnological
social
movement
in
which
individuals
and
small
organizations
are
involved
in
transforming
both
life
sciences
and
information
systems
using
low
cost
,
open-source
alternatives
,
and
open-access
tools
,
claiming
independence
from
both
academic
and
corporate
institutions
.
In
recent
weeks
,
several
biohackers
have
taken
part
in
online
biology
forums
to
help
investigate
potential
vaccines
and
innovative
methods
of
testing
them
,
often
on
the
vaccine
inventors
themselves
.
The
hunt
for
a
free
,
open
science
Coronavirus
vaccine
is
on
[
61
]
.Along
with
the
progressive
development
of
modern
vaccines
,
opinion
movements
against
vaccination
have
flourished
in
the
Western
world
.
Currently
,
the
news
on
anti-COVID-19
vaccines
have
further
ignited
opposition
protests
[
62
,
63
]
.
In
addition
to
the
movements
openly
opposed
to
vaccination
,
several
polls
show
that
a
significant
percentage
of
people
in
the
Western
countries
would
be
hesitant
or
contrary
to
take
a
COVID-19
vaccine
once
it
is
approved
.
The
chief
concern
among
those
surveyed
was
that
the
vaccine
approval
process
would
move
too
quickly
without
taking
the
time
to
properly
establish
safety
and
effectiveness
.
Certainly
,
the
intrusion
of
political
issues
into
the
pace
of
the
vaccine
evaluation
process
does
not
help
to
build
confidence
in
new
vaccines
.
However
,
by
the
time
vaccines
are
registered
and
made
available
,
data
on
their
efficacy
and
safety
will
have
been
carefully
reviewed
by
several
national
and
international
agencies
.
On
the
other
hand
,
these
vaccines
will
have
had
a
short
documentation
history
and
might
elicit
hypothetical
side
effects
after
a
long
time
,
that
could
not
have
been
previously
appreciated.This
is
,
however
,
a
conjectural
situation
.
Instead
,
it
is
likely
that
,
once
the
efficacy
of
a
COVID-19
vaccine
will
be
demonstrated
,
much
of
the
hesitation
about
this
vaccination
will
quickly
vanish
.
It
will
be
commonly
apparent
that
a
marked
reduction
in
the
risk
of
dying
from
COVID-19
largely
compensates
for
the
risk
of
hypothetical
late
side
effects.Attempts
to
obtain
these
vaccines
at
any
cost
are
almost
mirroring
the
vaccine
mistrust
.
The
illegal
purchase
of
Chinese
vaccines
,
and
probably
Chinese
fake
vaccines
,
is
starting
to
be
advertised
on
some
internet
sites
[
64
]
.
Certainly
,
the
possibility
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
eastern
Chinese
city
of
Jiaxing
involved
in
essential
works
to
buy
the
CoronaVax
vaccine
made
by
Sinovac
Biotech
which
is
still
being
in
Phase
III
trial
does
not
favor
the
control
of
this
dangerous
trade
(
Fig
.
1
)
.The
pandemic
drama
has
prompted
many
scientists
around
the
world
to
design
possible
alternative
COVID-19
vaccines
.
Thus
,
in
addition
to
the
large
number
of
official
projects
enlisted
by
WHO
[
4
]
,
numerous
university
laboratories
and
small
biotech
firms
are
studying
fresh
vaccines
.
This
clever
intellectual
and
technological
effort
provides
myriads
of
diverse
projects
,
some
of
which
could
become
important
if
front
runner
projects
will
confer
only
partial
protection
or
work
poorly
in
certain
clusters
of
the
population
.
High
costs
and
other
barriers
might
make
some
of
the
front
runner
vaccines
unsuitable
for
wide-scale
deployment
in
lower-income
countries
[
11
,
12
,
39
]
.
For
example
,
bacteriophage-based
vaccines
that
infect
nose
and
throat
microbes
and
make
them
produce
the
Spike
protein
,
or
other
vaccines
that
could
be
administered
by
nasal
insufflation
or
by
mouth
appear
to
be
stimulating
alternatives
.
It
would
really
be
a
great
achievement
to
develop
a
vaccine
that
can
induce
an
effective
immunity
on
the
mucosal
surfaces
:
it
could
impede
the
viral
infection
and
the
virus
spread
through
respiratory
droplets.The
success
and
approval
of
the
first
COVID-19
vaccines
should
not
detract
from
the
enthusiasm
and
practical
possibility
of
planning
new
studies
leading
to
the
development
and
production
of
second
and
third-generation
vaccines
[
11
,
12
]
as
well
as
the
design
of
different
types
of
clinical
trials
[
65
]
.
Indeed
,
COVID-19
eradication
is
going
to
be
a
long
and
winding
road
that
will
not
finish
once
we
have
the
first
vaccine
available.As
we
are
completing
this
briefing
,
the
COVID-19
vaccines
are
on
the
way
.
Currently
,
fresh
data
from
Phase
III
trials
are
permitting
vaccine
registration
.
Soon
after
,
few
vaccines
based
on
different
technologies
will
be
mandatory
or
made
available
for
selected
clusters
of
the
population
of
China
,
Russia
,
the
United
States
,
and
Europe.Thus
,
the
landscape
of
the
pandemic
is
taking
on
completely
different
features
.
We
will
know
if
vaccines
to
efficaciously
control
the
SARS-CoV-2
virus
spreading
remain
a
far
goal
or
if
they
are
already
here
.
In
the
latter
case
,
the
next
burning
issue
will
be
vaccine
availability
and
its
equitable
distribution
in
all
areas
of
the
world
.
Predatory
national
politics
aimed
at
ensuring
that
the
first
vaccine
doses
are
made
available
to
the
population
of
their
nation
will
clash
with
attempts
of
many
international
organizations
to
set
up
a
more
fair
distribution
in
all
countries
of
the
world
.
This
noble
effort
is
severely
contrasted
by
the
political
significance
that
the
COVID-19
vaccine
is
assuming
.
The
political
leader
or
the
country
that
produces
a
first
salvific
vaccine
can
exploit
it
to
affirm
its
ability
to
protect
its
citizens
as
well
as
the
inhabitants
of
friendly
countries
.
The
vaccine
,
thus
,
may
become
an
inappropriate
measure
of
power
[
48
,
59
]
.
How
many
seeds
of
disease
,
despair
,
and
death
will
difficult
access
to
the
vaccine
sow
among
the
people
of
the
earth
?
Cynically
,
it
could
just
be
the
relentless
predatory
rush
to
grab
the
first
doses
of
the
vaccine
that
could
produce
a
fair
distribution
of
surplus
vaccines
to
the
less
rich
nations
in
a
relatively
short
time
[
65
]
.Finally
,
it
is
our
tenet
that
in
the
long
run
more
than
one
vaccine
will
be
needed
to
ensure
equitable
global
access
,
protection
of
diverse
subjects
,
and
immunity
against
viral
variants.Forni

the
Coronavirus
Disease

)
,
which
has
been
the
most
challenging
pandemic
in
this
century
.
Considering
its
high
mortality
and
rapid
spread
,
an
effective
vaccine
is
urgently
needed
to
control
this

.
As
a
result
,
the

,
and

sectors
are
working
tightly
together
to
develop
and
test
a
variety
of

at
an

pace
.
In

the
essential

biological
characteristics
that
are
important
for

.
In

of
Severe

Coronavirus
(

,
we

challenges
of
COVID-19
vaccine
development.Coronaviruses
(
CoVs
)
are
a
group
of
related
viruses
that
can
cause
respiratory
tract
infection
in
humans
ranging
from
mild
symptoms
to
lethal
outcomes
.
Until
now
,
there
are
seven
genera
of
CoVs
that
are
known
to
infect
humans
[
1
]
.
Four
of
these
genera
,
including
Human
Coronavirus
229E
(
HCoV-229E
)
,
Human
Coronavirus
OC43
(
HCoV-OC43
)
,
Human
Coronavirus
NL63
(
HCoV-NL63
)
,
and
Human
Coronavirus
HKU1
(
HCoV-HKU1
)
,
only
cause
relatively
mild
and
self-limiting
respiratory
symptoms
[

.
Alternatively
,
the
other
three
CoVs
,
Severe
Acute
Respiratory
Syndrome
Coronavirus
(
SARS-CoV
)
,
Middle
East
Respiratory
Syndrome
Coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
,
and
Severe
Acute
Respiratory
Syndrome
Coronavirus
2
(
SARS-CoV-2
)
,
are
highly
pathogenic
and
can
lead
to
severe
respiratory
diseases
and
fatal
outcome
in
infected
patients
.
The
first
lethal
coronavirus
SARS-CoV
emerged
in
2002
in
Guangdong
Province
,
China
.
During
the
2002–2004
outbreak
,
SARS-CoV
had
infected
8,098
people
and
resulted
in
774
SARS-associated
deaths
(
~
10
%
mortality
rate
)
across
29
countries
before
it
disappeared
[
3
]
.
In
2012
,
MERS-CoV
emerged
in
Saudi
Arabia
.
It
caused
two
outbreaks
in
South
Korea
in
2015
and
in
Saudi
Arabia
in
2018
,
and
still
has
ongoing
reports
of
sporadic
cases
nowadays
.
As
of
January
2020
,
there
are
2,519
confirmed
MERS
cases
and
866
deaths
(
~
35
%
mortality
rate
)
across
27
countries
[
4
]
.
In
December
2019
,
a
new
type
of
CoV
that
can
cause
severe
respiratory
illness
emerged
in
Wuhan
,
China
.
The
World
Health
Organization
named
this
novel
virus
SARS-CoV-2
and
the
disease
COVID-19
,
or
Coronavirus
Disease
2019
.
The
clinical
manifestation
of
COVID-19
can
vary
from
asymptomatic
and
mild
flu-like
symptoms
to
acute
respiratory
distress
syndrome
and
death
.
Long-term
pulmonary
,
cardiological
,
and
neurological
complications
have
also
been
reported
in
COVID-19
cases
[
5
]
.
Compared
with
SARS-CoV
and
MERS-CoV
,
SARS-CoV-2
is
highly
contagious
with
an
estimated
reproductive
number
of
2.2
(
one
existing
COVID-19
case
can
cause
an
average
of
2.2
new
infections
)
[
6
]
.
In
addition
,
its
ability
to
spread
through
asymptomatic
patients
has
posed
a
great
challenge
to
containment
measures
[
7
]
.
By
October
2020
,
SARS-CoV-2
has
infected
more
than
43
million
individuals
and
resulted
in
about
1.15
million
deaths
(
~
3
%
mortality
rate
)
in
235
countries
,
areas
or
territories
worldwide
[

]
.
Needless
to
say
,
COVID-19
has
become
the
most
serious
public
health
crisis
of
our
generation
and
has
a
profound
impact
on
the
global
economy
and
geopolitics
.
Although
our
understanding
of
pathogenic
CoVs
has
been
steadily
accumulating
for
about
two
decades
,
no
effective
vaccine
has
yet
been
approved
for
the
prevention
of
human
CoV
infection
.
Considering
the
rapid
spread
and
high
mortality
of
COVID-19
,
an
effective
vaccine
is
urgently
needed
to
control
this
pandemic
.
In
this
review
,
we
summarize
relevant
CoV
biology
,
SARS
and
MERS
immunization
strategies
,
and
recent
efforts
of
COVID-19
vaccine
development
.
We
hope
this
review
can
provide
essential
knowledge
for
any
researcher
who
is
interested
in
COVID-19
vaccine
development.Coronaviruses
,
whose
name
derives
from
their
characteristic
crown-like
appearance
under
the
electron
microscope
,
are
enveloped
RNA
viruses
with
a
diameter
of
approximately
80–160
nm
[
9
,
10
]
.
The
genome
of
CoVs
is
a
~
30
kb
single-stranded
positive-sense
RNA
molecule
,
which
is
the
largest
genome
of
all
known
RNA
viruses
[
9,10,11
]
.
The
5′-terminus
of
the
CoV
genome
contains
two
overlapping
open
reading
frames
(
ORFs
)
:
ORF
1a
and
ORF
1b
,
spanning
two-thirds
of
the
genome
length
(
Fig
.
1a
)
[
9,10,11
]
.
ORF
1a
and
ORF
1ab
can
be
translated
into
two
polyproteins
(
pp
)
,
pp1a
and
pp1ab
,
which
are
further
cleaved
into
16
non-structural
proteins
(
Nsps
)
involved
in
viral
genome
replication
and
subgenomic
mRNA
synthesis
[
9,10,11
]
.
The
3′-terminus
of
the
CoV
genome
encodes
four
major
structural
proteins
in
the
order
of
spike
(
S
)
,
envelope
(
E
)
,
membrane
(
M
)
,
and
nucleocapsid
(
N
)
proteins
(

)
[

.
S
,
E
,
M
protein
forms
the
envelope
of
the
CoV
,
while
N
protein
forms
the
capsid
to
pack
genomic
RNA
(
Fig
.
1b
)
[
9,10,11
]
.
The
3′-terminus
of
the
genome
also
encodes
multiple
accessory
proteins
,
which
are
usually
genus-specific
and
can

The
S
protein
is
particularly
important
for
virus-cell
receptor
binding
and
virus-cell
membrane
fusion
,
suggesting
that
it
can
be
an
effective
target
for
CoV
vaccine
design
[
15
]
.
In
fact
,
studies
have
shown
that
antibodies
generated
against
the
S
protein
are
long-lasting
and
immunodominant
in
recovered
SARS
patients
[
18
,
19
]
.
In
addition
,
several
studies
have
demonstrated
that
the
anti-S
antibody
can
neutralize
SARS-CoV
and
MERS-CoV
and
provides
protective
effects
in
animals
and
humans
[
20,21,22
]
.
Moreover
,
many
S
protein-based
vaccines
against
SARS-CoV
and
MERS-CoV
have
been
shown
to
elicit
potent
immune
responses
and
protective
effects
in
preclinical
models
[
23,24,25,26,27
]
.
These
results
corroborate
that
CoV
S
protein
serves
as
an
ideal
vaccine
target
to
induce
neutralizing
antibodies
and
protective
immunity
.
Besides
S
protein
,
other
structural
proteins
have
also
been
tested
as
vaccine
targets
.
N
protein-based
vaccines
usually
can
not
induce
neutralizing
antibodies
,
likely
due
to
the
fact
that
N
protein
is
not
displayed
on
the
CoV
surface
[
16
]
.
However
,
N
protein
has
the
advantage
of
being
more
conserved
across
CoV
species
than
S
protein
,
making
it
a
potential
target
for
a
T-cell
inducing
,
universal
CoV
vaccine
[
16
]
.
One
recent
study
has
shown
that
a
viral
vector
vaccine
expressing
N
protein
can
induce
CD4+
T
cell-dependent
protection
against
SARS-CoV
and
MERS-CoV
,
suggesting
the
feasibility
of
N
protein-based
T-cell
inducing
CoV
vaccines
[
28
]
.
M
protein-based
vaccines
,
on
the
other
hand
,
can
induce
a
high
titer
of
antibody
response
in
immunized
animals
[
29
]
.
However
,
no
neutralization
antibody
or
protective
immunity
data
of
M
protein-based
vaccines
in
preclinical
models
have
been
demonstrated
.
Finally
,
very
few
CoV
E
protein-based
immunization
studies
have
been
reported
so
far
,
and
none
of
the
studies
demonstrated
induction
of
neutralizing
antibodies
or
protective
immunity
[
30
]
.There
are
also
immunopathological
complications
associated
with
the
SARS-CoV
and
MERS-CoV
vaccines
that
require
addressing
and
further
optimization
.
One
adverse
effect
is
the
induction
of
antibody-dependent
enhancement
(
ADE
)
effect
,
which
is
usually
caused
by
vaccine-induced
suboptimal
antibodies
that
facilitates
viral
entry
into
host
cells
[
11
,
31
]
.
A
study
found
that
SARS-CoV
vaccine
based
on
full-length
S
protein
enhances
SARS-CoV
infection
of
human
cell
lines
in
vitro
[
32
]
.
Additionally
,
two
studies
have
also
shown
that
anti-S
protein
serum
results
in
increased
viral
infectivity
of
SARS-CoV
[
33
,
34
]
.
These
results
raise
safety
concerns
for
S
protein-based
SARS-CoV
and
MERS-CoV
vaccines
.
One
potential
strategy
to
overcome
the
ADE
problem
is
to
design
vaccines
that
only
contain
major
neutralizing
epitopes
,
such
as
the
S1
subunit
or
the
RBD
domain
of
the
S
protein
.
This
strategy
can
decrease
the
induction
of
non-neutralizing
antibodies
by
CoV
vaccines
and
therefore
reduce
the
ADE
effect
.
Another
potential
adverse
effect
is
vaccine-induced
eosinophilic
immunopathology
,
which
is
an
unwanted
Th2-skewed
immune
response
elicited
by
vaccination
[
11
,
35
]
.
At
least
two
studies
have
reported
that
whole
inactivated
virus
vaccine
of
SARS-CoV
induces
eosinophilic
proinflammatory
pulmonary
response
after
mice
challenged
with
SARS-CoV
[
36
,
37
]
.
In
addition
,
one
study
also
reported
that
immunization
with
SARS-CoV
virus-like
particle
(
VLP
)
vaccine
leads
to
eosinophilic
immunopathology
in
the
lung
after
viral
challenge
[
37
]
.
In
order
to
prevent
this
Th2-type
immunopathology
,
a
few
studies
have
worked
on
adjuvant
optimization
.
They
found
that
appropriate
adjuvants
,
such
as
Toll-like
receptor
agonist
and
delta-inulin
polysaccharide
,
can
increase
serum
neutralizing
antibody
titers
and
reduce
lung
eosinophilic
immunopathology
[
38
,
39
]
.
Their
results
provide
a
promising
strategy
to
deal
with
Th2-skewed
immune
response
induced
by
some
CoV
vaccines.Various
forms
of
vaccines
targeting
SARS-CoV
and
MERS-CoV
have
been
developed
and
tested
in
preclinical
models
.
However
,
only
a
few
of
them
entered
clinical
trials
and
none
of
them
have
been
FDA
approved
.
These
approaches
include
protein
subunit
vaccines
,
virus-like
particle
vaccines
,
DNA
vaccines
,
viral
vector
vaccines
,
whole-inactivated
vaccines
and
live-attenuated
vaccines
.
The
following
sections
outline
the
principles
of
various
forms
of
SARS-CoV
and
MERS-CoV
vaccine
development
(
Table
1
)
,
and
the
latest
results
from
both
preclinical
studies
and
clinical
trials
(
Table
2
)
.Protein
subunit
vaccines
consist
of
viral
antigenic
fragments
produced
by
recombinant
protein
techniques
.
They
are
easy
to
produce
,
and
relatively
safe
and
well-tolerated
compared
to
whole
virus
vaccines
and
viral
vector
vaccines
.
The
drawback
of
protein
subunit
vaccines
is
their
low
immunogenicity
.
Therefore
,
adjuvants
and
fusion
with
immunostimulatory
molecules
are
usually
used
together
with
subunit
vaccines
to
overcome
this
challenge.The
development
of
SARS-CoV
protein
subunit
vaccines
was
initially
surrounding
full-length
S
protein-based
vaccines
and
then
later
focused
on
S
protein
RBD-based
vaccines
.
None
of
the
SARS-CoV
protein
subunit
vaccines
entered
clinical
trials
,
but
they
induced
potent
antibody
responses
and
protective
effects
in
preclinical
models
[
23
,
24
,
32
,
40,41,42,43,44
]
.
Studies
have
shown
that
full-length
S
protein
,
extracellular
domain
of
the
S
protein
,
and
trimeric
S
proteins
(
triSpike
)
are
all
immunogenic
and
can
elicit
protection
against
SARS-CoV
infection
[
23
,
24
,
32
]
.
However
,
Kam
et
al
.
and
Jamue
et
al
.
have
found
that
triSpike
vaccine
can
also
cause
Fcγ
receptor
II
(
FcγRII
)
-dependent
SARS-CoV
infection
in
human
B
cells
in
vitro
[
32
,
33
]
.
On
the
other
hand
,
S
protein
RBD-based
vaccines
are
able
to
induce
high-titer
neutralizing
antibodies
without
causing
obvious
pathogenic
effects
[
40,41,42,43,44
]
.
This
is
probably
because
RBD-based
vaccines
do
not
contain
additional
non-neutralizing
epitopes
as
full-length
S
protein
vaccines
do
.
One
study
has
shown
that
RBD-based
vaccines
not
only
protect
most
of
the
SARS-CoV
challenged
mice
with
no
detectable
viral
RNA
in
the
lung
,
but
can
also
induce
long-lasting
S-specific
antibodies
that
can
be
maintained
for
12
months
[
42
]
.
Furthermore
,
RBD-based
SARS-CoV
vaccines
have
also
been
shown
to
induce
RBD-specific
IFN-γ
producing
cellular
immune
responses
in
mice
[
44
]
.
As
a
result
,
SARS-CoV
RBD
has
become
the
main
target
for
SARS
vaccines
.
Finally
,
SARS-CoV
subunit
vaccines
based
on
S2
subunit
,
N
and
M
structural
proteins
have
also
been
tested
[
29
,
45
,
46
]
.
However
,
no
evidence
has
shown
that
they
can
induce
neutralizing
antibodies
or
protective
effects
against
viral
challenge.Guided
by
previous
SARS-CoV
experiences
,
most
proteins
subunit
vaccines
of
MERS-CoV
are
focused
on
RBD-based
vaccines
.
RBD-based
MERS-CoV
vaccines
generally
show
great
immunogenicity
and
elicit
potent
neutralizing
antibodies
,
cell-mediated
immunity
,
and
protective
effect
against
MERS-CoV
infection
[
25
,
26
]
.
One
study
from
Tai
et
al
.
found
that
trimeric
RBD
protein
vaccines
can
induce
long-lasting
neutralizing
antibodies
for
6
months
[
26
]
.
Another
study
also
from
Tai
et
al
.
demonstrated
that
recombinant
RBD
proteins
from
different
MERS-CoV
strains
can
induce
antibodies
that
cross-neutralize
with
divergent
human
and
camel
MERS-CoV
strains
[
25
]
.
These
results
indicate
that
MERS-CoV
RBD
serves
as
a
promising
vaccine
target
with
the
ability
to
induce
long-lasting
and
broad-spectrum
neutralizing
antibodies
against
infection
.
Other
than
RBD-based
vaccines
,
RBD-containing
S1
subunit
vaccines
have
also
been
shown
to
induce
neutralizing
antibodies
and
protection
against
MERS-CoV
[
47
,
48
]
.
Notably
,
the
N-terminal
domain
(
NTD
)
of
the
S
protein
binds
to
sialic
acid
and
is
important
for
MERS-CoV
infection
in
certain
cell
types
.
Jiaming
et
al
.
showed
that
immunization
with
NTD-based
vaccine
also
provides
protection
against
MERS-CoV
and
induces
potent
humoral
and
cell-mediated
immunity
[
49
]
.
However
,
since
SARS-CoV-2
NTD
does
not
have
the
same
sialic
acid-binding
function
as
MERS-CoV
,
NTD-based
strategy
might
not
be
generalizable
to
SARS-CoV-2
vaccine
development.Apart
from
antigen
design
,
several
other
factors
also
affect
the
efficacy
of
protein
subunit
vaccines
[
16
]
.
The
expression
system
of
protein
influences
the
quality
and
quantity
of
protein
subunit
vaccines
.
Du
et
al
.
demonstrated
that
SARS-CoV
RBD
protein
expressed
by
mammalian
293T
cells
induces
stronger
neutralizing
antibody
responses
than
RBD
expressed
by
insect
cells
and
E.
coli
,
which
is
probably
due
to
the
native
conformation
and
post-translational
modification
maintained
in
mammalian
cellular
system
[
43
]
.
In
addition
,
adjuvants
play
an
important
role
in
enhancing
the
immunogenicity
of
protein
subunit
vaccines
.
Zhang
et
al
.
have
examined
multiple
adjuvants
(
Freund
’
s
,
aluminum
,
Monophosphoryl
lipid
A
,
Montanide
ISA51
and
MF59
)
in
conjugation
with
MERS-CoV
RBD
and
found
that
MF59
best
potentiate
the
protein
to
elicit
neutralizing
antibodies
and
protective
effects
[
50
]
.
Their
data
provide
a
good
starting
point
for
optimizing
adjuvants
for
SARS-CoV-2
subunit
vaccines
.
Moreover
,
the
immunization
route
of
the
subunit
vaccine
can
also
affect
its
potency
,
and
in
combination
with
different
antigen
and
adjuvants
,
the
optimized
vaccination
pathway
may
change
.
For
example
,
Li
et
al
.
demonstrated
that
for
SARS-CoV
S
and
S1
subunit
vaccine
,
intramuscular
(
I.M
.
)
route
induces
stronger
antibody
responses
than
subcutaneous
(
S.C.
)
route
,
while
Lan
et
al
.
showed
that
S.C.
route
is
preferable
over
I.M
.
injection
for
Freund
’
s
and
CpG-adjuvanted
MERS-CoV
RBD
vaccine
[
23
,
51
]
.
Therefore
,
the
ideal
route
might
need
to
be
customized
for
SARS-CoV-2
subunit
vaccines.Virus-like
particles
(
VLPs
)
are
self-assembled
viral
structural
proteins
that
mimic
the
conformation
of
native
viruses
but
lack
the
viral
genome
.
Compared
with
protein
subunit
vaccines
,
VLP
vaccines
present
epitope
in
conformation
that
is
more
similar
to
the
native
virus
,
leading
to
better
immunization
responses
.
In
addition
,
compared
to
whole
virus
vaccines
,
the
production
of
VLP
vaccines
does
not
involve
live
virus
or
inactivation
steps
,
which
makes
them
safer
vaccine
candidates
.
The
highly
repetitive
antigenic
surface
of
VLP
vaccines
also
help
induce
stronger
antibody
response
by
efficiently
cross-linking
B-cell
surface
receptors
.
Up
to
now
,
VLP
vaccines
have
been
commercialized
for
the
protection
against
human
papillomavirus
(
Cervarix™
and
Gardasil®
)
and
hepatitis
B
virus
(
Engerix®
and
Recombivax
HB®
)
[

]
.Few
SARS-CoV
and
MERS-CoV
VLP
vaccines
have
been
reported
so
far
.
For
SARS-CoV
,
Lokugamage
et
al
.
have
demonstrated
that
chimeric
VLPs
composed
of
SARS-CoV
S
protein
and
mouse
hepatitis
virus
E
,
M
and
N
proteins
can
induce
neutralizing
antibody
responses
and
reduce
SARS-CoV
virus
titer
in
mice
lung
after
viral
challenge
[
53
]
.
In
addition
,
another
study
performed
by
Liu
et
al
.
showed
that
chimeric
VLPs
consisting
of
SARS-CoV
S
protein
and
influenza
virus
M1
protein
can
induce
neutralizing
antibodies
and
provide
protection
against
lethal
challenge
in
mice
[
54
]
.
However
,
one
study
used
the
same
chimeric
VLPs
as
Lokugamage
et
al
.
and
showed
that
this
VLP
vaccine
can
lead
to
pulmonary
immunopathology
on
challenge
with
SARS-CoV
[
37
,
53
]
.
Therefore
,
potential
adverse
effects
of
coronavirus
VLP
vaccines
should
be
monitored
.
For
MERS-CoV
VLP
vaccines
,
Wang
et
al
.
have
shown
that
VLPs
containing
MERS-CoV
S
,
E
and
M
proteins
can
induce
specific
antibody
response
and
Th1-mediated
cellular
immunity
in
rhesus
macaques
[
55
]
.
The
same
research
group
developed
another
chimeric
VLP
vaccine
containing
the
fusion
of
the
receptor-binding
domain
(
RBD
)
of
MERS-CoV
S
protein
and
the
canine
parvovirus
(
CPV
)
VP2
structural
protein
[
56
]
.
They
showed
that
this
VLP
vaccine
induces
MERS-CoV-specific
antibody
response
and
T-cell
immunity
in
mice
[
56
]
.
These
studies
suggested
that
VLP
vaccines
hold
the
potential
for
clinically
effective
coronavirus
vaccines.DNA
vaccines
contain
genes
encoding
viral
antigenic
components
that
are
expressed
by
plasmid
vectors
and
delivered
into
cells
through
electroporation
.
Compared
with
other
vaccine
technologies
,
DNA
vaccines
offer
a
fast
and
flexible
platform
for
vaccine
development
and
production
,
making
it
an
attractive
technology
to
combat
emerging
epidemics
like
SARS-CoV-2
.
In
addition
,
antigen
production
of
DNA
vaccines
happens
in
the
target
cells
,
which
helps
recapitulate
the
native
conformation
and
post-translational
modification
of
viral
antigens
.
However
,
an
important
drawback
of
DNA
vaccines
is
their
limited
immunogenicity
due
to
their
inability
to
spread
and
amplify
in
vivo
.
Therefore
,
it
is
important
to
consider
strategies
that
can
enhance
the
potency
of
DNA
vaccines
,
such
as
adding
adjuvant
or
using
a
prime-boost
regimen
.
Besides
,
the
genomic
integration
of
DNA
vaccines
into
the
host
chromosome
is
another
biosafety
concern
,
which
may
lead
to
mutagenesis
and
oncogenesis
[
57
]
.
Even
though
previous
studies
have
shown
that
the
risk
of
vaccine
plasmid
insertion
into
the
host
chromosome
is
pretty
low
,
the
FDA
and
the
WHO
still
recommends
integration
studies
be
included
as
part
of
the
safety
program
of
DNA
vaccines
[
58
,
59
]
.Several
DNA
vaccine
candidates
have
been
reported
for
SARS-CoV
,
including
the
S-
,
M-
,
and
N
protein-based
vaccines
[
60,61,62,63,64
]
.
Although
all
of
them
can
generate
a
certain
level
of
antibody
and
cell-immune
responses
,
only
S
protein-based
DNA
vaccine
has
been
shown
to
induce
protective
effect
against
SARS-CoV
infection
,
probably
due
to
the
indispensable
role
of
S
protein
in
receptor
binding
[
60
]
.
Yang
et
al
.
has
demonstrated
that
immunization
with
DNA
encoding
full-length
S
protein
,
S
protein
lacking
part
of
cytoplasmic
domain
,
S
protein
lacking
both
cytoplasmic
and
transmembrane
domains
can
all
induce
neutralizing
antibodies
and
T-cell
immune
responses
,
as
well
as
providing
protective
effect
in
mice
[
60
]
.
This
promising
result
leads
to
a
following
phase
I
clinical
trial
based
on
SARS-CoV
full-length
S
protein
DNA
vaccine
,
which
showed
that
the
vaccine
was
well-tolerated
in
patients
and
can
induce
neutralizing
antibodies
and
T
cell
responses
in
healthy
adults
[
65
]
.
Furthermore
,
two
studies
have
made
use
of
prime-boost
strategy
to
enhance
the
potency
of
S
protein-based
SARS-CoV
DNA
vaccine
.
Zakhartchouk
et
al
.
reported
that
the
combination
of
DNA
and
whole-inactivated
SARS-CoV
vaccines
can
increase
the
magnitude
of
antibody
response
as
well
as
inducing
a
more
desirable
Th1-skewed
immune
response
[
66
]
.
Woo
et
al
.
demonstrated
that
using
DNA
vaccine
priming
plus
E.
coli
expressed
recombinant
S
protein
booster
can
also
induce
higher
neutralization
titers
than
DNA
or
protein
subunit
vaccine
alone
[
67
]
.Similar
to
SARS-CoV
,
several
studies
on
MERS-CoV
DNA
vaccines
have
demonstrated
optimistic
results
.
Muthumani
et
al
.
reported
that
a
full-length
S
protein-based
MERS-CoV
DNA
vaccine
can
induce
potent
cellular
immunity
and
antigen-specific
neutralizing
antibodies
in
mice
,
macaques
,
and
camels
,
and
macaques
vaccinated
with
this
DNA
vaccine
were
protected
against
MERS-CoV
challenge
without
demonstrating
any
clinical
or
radiographic
signs
of
pneumonia
[
68
]
.
Building
on
these
encouraging
data
,
a
phase
I
clinical
trial
based
on
this
MERS-CoV
DNA
vaccine
(
GLS-5300
,
or
INO-4700
)
has
been
completed
[
69
]
.
The
results
showed
that
GLS-5300
is
well
tolerated
with
no
vaccine-associated
serious
adverse
events
,
and
immunization
with
GLS-5300
induces
durable
immune
responses
in
85
%
of
participants
after
two
vaccinations
[
69
]
.
These
data
support
further
development
of
the
GLS-5300
vaccine
.
Notably
,
a
SARS-CoV-2
DNA
vaccine
candidate
,
INO-4800
,
is
based
on
the
same
design
as
GLS-5300
,
and
this
vaccine
is
now
in
phase
I/II
clinical
trial
(
NCT04447781
and
NCT04336410
)
[
70
]
.
In
addition
,
another
MERS-CoV
vaccine
study
using
full-length
S
protein
DNA
priming
plus
S1
protein
subunit
booster
elicits
robust
serum-neutralizing
activity
against
several
MERS-CoV
strains
in
mice
and
rhesus
macaques
[
47
]
.
Immunizing
rhesus
macaques
with
this
DNA
prime/protein
boost
vaccine
confers
protection
against
MERS-CoV-induced
radiographic
pneumonia
,
supporting
this
strategy
as
a
promising
approach
for
MERS-CoV
vaccine
development
[
47
]
.
Aside
from
full-length
S
,
S1
subunit
is
also
a
good
target
for
MERS-CoV
DNA
vaccine
.
One
study
performed
by
Al-Amri
et
al
.
has
compared
the
immunogenicity
of
full-length
S-based
(
pS
)
and
S1-based
(
pS1
)
MERS-CoV
vaccine
using
the
same
expression
vector
[
71
]
.
They
found
that
pS1
immunization
elicited
a
balanced
Th1/Th2
response
and
generally
higher
levels
of
all
IgG
isotypes
compared
to
pS
vaccination
,
which
may
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
the
transmembrane
domain-lacking
S1
subunit
is
secreted
more
efficiently
to
the
extracellular
space
and
therefore
result
in
greater
uptake
by
antigen-presenting
cells
[
71
]
.
This
study
suggested
that
S1
might
be
a
better
target
than
full-length
S
for
MERS-CoV
DNA
vaccine
[
71
]
.Taken
together
,
DNA
vaccines
encoding
full-length
S
or
S1
protein
have
demonstrated
encouraging
results
to
fight
against
SARS-CoV
and
MERS-CoV
.
The
same
strategy
is
likely
to
be
generalizable
to
SARS-CoV-2
DNA
vaccine
considering
the
biological
similarity.Viral
vector
vaccines
are
recombinant
viruses
that
encode
antigens
of
interest
in
an
unrelated
modified
virus
.
They
deliver
antigen
into
the
cells
mimicking
natural
infection
,
so
they
induce
strong
antigen-specific
cellular
and
humoral
immune
responses
per
se
,
thereby
obviating
the
need
for
additional
adjuvants
.
In
addition
,
viral
vectors
are
able
to
accept
large
insertions
in
their
genome
,
providing
a
flexible
platform
for
antigen
design
.
Despite
these
advantages
,
there
are
several
drawbacks
.
The
manufacturing
process
for
viral
vector
vaccines
is
more
complicated
than
other
approaches
,
including
the
optimization
of
cellular
systems
and
the
exclusion
of
contaminants
,
which
can
greatly
affect
the
efficiency
of
viral
vectors
[
57
]
.
Moreover
,
recombinant
viruses
carry
the
risk
of
integrating
their
genome
into
the
human
host
,
so
additional
biosafety
assessment
will
be
required
before
entering
clinical
trials
.
Finally
,
if
the
chosen
viral
vector
can
infect
the
general
populations
,
the
pre-existing
immunity
on
the
viral
vector
could
dampen
the
induced
immune
response
,
which
has
been
seen
in
adenovirus-
and
measle
virus-based
vaccines
[
72
,
73
]
.Similar
to
DNA
and
protein
subunit
vaccines
,
most
viral
vector
coronavirus
vaccines
target
the
S
antigen
.
Numerous
viral
vectors
have
been
used
to
develop
SARS-CoV
and
MERS-CoV
vaccines
,
which
have
been
described
in
detail
in
previous
review
articles
[
74
,
75
]
.
In
the
following
sections
,
we
will
highlight
vaccines
based
on
adenovirus
,
modified
vaccinia
virus
Ankara
and
Venezuelan
equine
encephalitis
virus
,
which
are
the
most
well
studied
viral
vector
platforms
for
coronavirus
vaccines
.
We
will
also
briefly
introduce
other
recombinant
viral
platforms
that
are
being
actively
developed
for
coronavirus
vaccines.Adenovirus
is
a
popular
viral
vector
vaccine
that
has
been
tested
in
clinical
trials
for
a
wide
variety
of
diseases
,
and
several
studies
have
also
examined
the
efficacy
of
adenovirus-based
SARS-CoV
vaccine
.
The
feasibility
of
SARS
adenovirus
vector
vaccine
was
first
demonstrated
in
two
study
by
Gao
et
al
.
and
Liu
et
al
.
[
76
,
77
]
.
They
showed
that
adenoviral
vector
expressing
S1
fragment
can
induce
neutralizing
antibodies
in
monkeys
and
rats
,
respectively
,
but
neither
studies
showed
evidences
of
in
vivo
protection
against
SARS-CoV
challenge
[
76
,
77
]
.
Later
on
,
See
et
al
.
compared
the
efficacy
of
SARS-CoV
S
protein
expressing
adenovirus
vaccine
with
the
whole
inactivated
SARS-CoV
vaccine
[
78
]
.
They
found
that
both
vaccines
induce
protective
effects
in
mice
against
SARS-CoV
challenge
,
though
the
neutralizing
antibody
response
is
weaker
in
adenovirus-based
vaccine
than
whole-inactivated
virus
vaccine
[
78
]
.
Besides
,
Kobinger
et
al
.
have
also
tested
a
prime-boost
regimen
of
S
protein-expressing
human
adenovirus
type
5
and
chimpanzee
derived
adenoviruses
in
ferrets
[
79
]
.
Their
results
showed
that
this
vaccine
leads
to
a
substantial
reduction
in
viral
load
and
prevents
pneumonia
in
ferrets
after
SARS-CoV
challenge
[
79
]
.
All
these
results
have
encouraged
subsequent
development
of
adenovirus-based
MERS
and
COVID-19
vaccines.Modified
vaccinia
virus
Ankara
(
MVA
)
is
another
well-established
vaccine
platform
to
combat
emerging
infectious
diseases
[
80
]
.
Bisht
et
al
.
has
shown
that
intranasal
or
intramuscular
immunization
with
highly
attenuated
MVA
containing
full-length
S
gene
induces
both
neutralizing
antibody
responses
and
protective
immunity
in
mice
,
evident
by
reduced
virus
titer
in
mice
lung
post
SARS-CoV
challenge
[
81
]
.
Another
study
performed
by
Chen
et
al
.
demonstrated
that
recombinant
MVA
expressing
SARS-CoV
S
protein
elicits
neutralizing
antibodies
in
mice
,
ferrets
,
and
monkeys
,
but
they
didn
’
t
show
any
protection
experiment
data
in
this
study
[
82
]
.
However
,
another
two
studies
performed
by
Weingartl
et
al
.
and
Czub
et
al
.
showed
that
MVA
vaccine
expressing
SARS-CoV
S
protein
does
not
provide
protective
effect
in
ferrets
,
and
it
even
induces
inflammatory
responses
and
focal
necrosis
in
the
liver
[
83
,
84
]
.
Therefore
,
potential
adverse
effects
need
to
be
considered
for
MVA-based
SARS-CoV
S
protein
vaccine.For
Venezuelan
equine
encephalitis
(
VEE
)
virus-based
SARS-CoV
vaccine
,
Deming
et
al
.
has
reported
that
VEE
virus
replicon
particles
(
VRP
)
expressing
S
protein
provides
complete
short-
and
long-term
protection
against
homologous
strain
challenge
in
young
and
senescent
mice
[
85
]
.
To
further
improve
the
efficacy
of
VEE
virus-based
vaccine
against
heterologous
SARS-CoV
challenge
,
Sheahan
et
al
.
has
improved
the
immunogenicity
of
VRP
S
protein
vaccine
by
substituting
an
attenuated
VEE
glycoprotein
with
its
wild-type
counterpart
,
and
their
result
showed
that
the
improved
VRP
S
protein
vaccine
can
protect
aged
mice
from
heterologous
SARS-CoV
challenge
[
86
]
.Several
additional
viral
vectors
have
also
shown
promising
results
for
SARS-CoV
vaccines
.
Two
studies
from
Buchholz
et
al
.
and
Bukreyev
et
al
.
have
used
an
attenuated
parainfluenza
virus
as
vector
to
express
SARS-CoV
S
protein
,
showing
that
parainfluenza-based
vaccine
can
induce
neutralizing
antibody
responses
and
protective
effect
against
SARS-CoV
challenge
in
hamsters
and
monkeys
[
30
,
87
]
.
Besides
,
attenuated
vesicular
stomatitis
virus
(
VSV
)
have
also
been
tested
as
SARS-CoV
vaccine
vectors
by
Kapadia
et
al
.
[
88
]
.
Their
results
showed
that
immunization
with
recombinant
VSV
expressing
S
protein
can
induce
SARS-neutralizing
antibodies
and
is
able
to
protect
mice
from
SARS-CoV
infection
[
88
]
.Several
adenovirus-based
MERS-CoV
vaccines
have
been
developed
.
Human
adenovirus
type
5
(
Ad5
)
and
type
41
(
Ad41
)
expressing
MERS-CoV
S
or
S1
protein
have
been
shown
to
induce
neutralizing
antibodies
in
mice
[
89
,
90
]
.
However
,
the
protection
effect
of
Ad5-
and
Ad41-based
MERS
vaccines
have
not
been
evaluated
[
89
,
90
]
.
Notably
,
Ad5-MERS-S
vaccine
has
been
used
in
combination
with
S
protein
nanoparticles
[
91
]
.
Heterologous
immunization
by
priming
with
Ad5/MERS
and
boosting
with
spike
protein
nanoparticles
has
demonstrated
not
only
protective
effect
in
hDPP4-transduced
mice
against
MERS-CoV
challenge
,
but
also
more
balanced
Th1/Th2
responses
than
Ad5-
or
nanoparticles-alone
homologous
prime-boost
vaccines
[
91
]
.
The
Ad5
vector
has
already
been
applied
to
SARS-CoV-2
vaccine
development
,
and
promising
results
have
been
demonstrated
in
phase
I
and
II
clinical
trials
[
92
,
93
]
.Besides
,
chimpanzee
adenovirus
has
been
employed
as
viral
vector
with
an
aim
to
overcome
the
pre-existing
immunity
problem
of
human
adenoviruses
.
A
MERS-CoV
S
protein
vaccine
based
on
a
chimpanzee
adenoviral
vector
(
ChAdOx1
)
was
shown
to
induce
high
levels
of
neutralizing
antibodies
and
cell-mediated
immune
in
mice
,
and
to
protect
hDPP4-transduced
mice
from
lethal
MERS-CoV
challenge
[
94
,
95
]
.
In
addition
,
ChAdOx1-MERS
vaccine
has
also
been
demonstrated
to
reduce
viral
load
in
dromedary
camels
and
provide
protective
immunity
in
rhesus
macaques
[
96
,
97
]
.
Given
these
promising
preclinical
results
,
the
ChAdOx1-MERS
vaccine
has
entered
a
phase
I
clinical
trial
,
and
the
trial
result
showed
that
ChAdOx1-MERS
was
safe
and
well
tolerated
at
all
tested
doses
,
and
a
single
dose
was
capable
of
inducing
both
humoral
and
cellular
responses
against
MERS-CoV
[
98
]
.
Notably
,
the
same
research
team
has
applied
ChAdOx1
platform
to
SARS-CoV-2
vaccine
development
and
their
product
AZD1222
(
or
ChAdOx1-nCoV-19
)
is
now
a
leading
player
of
the
COVID-19
vaccine
race
[
99
]
.The
vaccine
of
modified
vaccinia
virus
Ankara
(
MVA
)
expressing
full-length
MERS-CoV
S
protein
has
been
reported
to
induce
not
only
virus-neutralizing
antibody
responses
and
MERS-CoV-specific
CD8+
T
cell
response
,
but
also
provide
protective
effect
against
MERS-CoV
in
DPP4-transduced
mice
[
100
]
.
Furthermore
,
dromedary
camels
immunized
with
this
MVA-based
MERS-CoV
S
protein
vaccine
generate
neutralizing
antibodies
and
show
less
virus
excretion
after
MERS-CoV
infection
[
101
]
.
Since
camel
is
a
major
animal
reservoir
for
MERS-CoV
,
this
vaccine
provides
an
opportunity
to
effectively
control
camel-to-human
transmission
[
101
]
.
Finally
,
a
phase
I
clinical
trial
showed
that
MVA-MERS-S
vaccine
has
a
favorable
safety
profile
,
and
homologous
prime–boost
immunization
of
MVA-MERS-S
vaccine
induces
humoral
and
cell-mediated
immune
responses
against
MERS-CoV
,
which
supports
testing
MVA-MERS-S
vaccine
in
a
larger
population
[
102
]
.MERS-CoV
vaccines
dependent
on
Venezuelan
equine
encephalitis
(
VEE
)
virus
have
also
been
studied
.
Agnihothram
et
al
.
have
demonstrated
that
VEE
virus
replicon
particles
(
VRP
)
expressing
MERS-CoV
S
protein
can
induce
neutralizing
antibodies
in
young
and
aged
mice
[
103
]
.
Another
study
from
Zhao
et
al
.
found
that
VRP-based
MERS
N
protein
vaccine
can
induce
memory
CD4+
immune
response
and
provide
protective
immunity
against
MERS-CoV
in
hDPP4-transduced
mice
[
28
]
.
Since
N
protein
is
more
conserved
than
S
protein
across
different
coronavirus
species
,
their
approach
might
hold
the
potential
to
develop
a
universal
T
cell-inducing
coronavirus
vaccine
[
28
]
.Several
other
vaccine
platforms
have
been
applied
for
the
development
of
MERS-CoV
vaccine
.
Measle
virus-
and
rabies
virus-based
MERS-CoV
S
protein
vaccines
have
been
shown
to
induce
neutralizing
antibodies
and
provide
protective
effect
against
MERS-CoV
in
hDDP4-transduced
mice
[
104
,
105
]
.
Newcastle
disease
virus
and
vesicular
stomatitis
virus
vectors
have
also
been
employed
as
S
protein-expressing
MERS
vaccines
[
106
,
107
]
.
However
,
only
in
vitro
neutralization
data
have
been
provided
and
no
in
vivo
protection
data
has
been
demonstrated
for
these
two
vaccines
[
106
,
107
]
.In
summary
,
SARS-CoV
and
MERS-CoV
vaccines
based
on
many
viral
vectors
,
including
adenovirus
,
modified
vaccinia
virus
Ankara
,
Venezuelan
equine
encephalitis
virus
,
parainfluenza
virus
,
vesicular
stomatitis
virus
,
Measle
virus
,
and
rabies
virus
,
have
been
shown
to
elicit
protective
immunity
against
viral
challenges
.
Some
of
these
viral
vectors
has
already
become
promising
candidate
platforms
for
the
development
of
SARS-CoV-2
vaccine.Whole
inactivated
vaccines
are
composed
of
chemically
or
radiationally
inactivated
virions
.
They
contain
a
full
repertoire
of
immunogenic
components
of
the
original
virus
,
and
compared
with
attenuated
viruses
,
they
carry
no
risk
of
viral
reactivation
if
properly
inactivated
.
Although
safer
than
live
attenuated
vaccines
,
the
immunogenic
epitopes
of
inactivated
viruses
may
be
structurally
deformed
during
the
inactivation
process
,
which
can
undermine
the
protection
they
may
provide
.
Moreover
,
both
SARS-CoV
and
MERS-CoV
whole
inactivated
vaccines
have
been
reported
to
induce
eosinophil-related
lung
pathology
[
36
,
37
]
.
These
disadvantages
make
whole
inactivated
vaccines
a
less
attractive
strategy
for
coronavirus
vaccine
development.During
the
early
development
of
SARS-CoV
vaccines
,
inactivated
whole
virus
was
once
a
leading
strategy
.
Studies
have
shown
that
UV-
and
formaldehyde-inactivated
SARS-CoV
can
induce
neutralizing
antibody
response
,
and
a
phase
I
clinical
trial
using
β-propiolactone-inactivated
SARS-CoV
vaccine
demonstrated
that
it
is
safe
,
well-tolerated
,
and
can
elicit
SARS-CoV-specific
neutralizing
antibodies
[
108,109,110
]
.
However
,
later
studies
found
that
a
UV-formaldehyde
doubly
inactivated
SARS-CoV
vaccine
,
either
unadjuvanted
or
alum-adjuvanted
,
provides
incomplete
protection
in
mice
and
induces
eosinophilic
pulmonary
inflammatory
response
upon
SARS-CoV
challenge
[
36
]
.
Similarly
,
gamma-irradiated
MERS-CoV
vaccine
adjuvanted
with
alum
or
MF59
also
induces
eosinophil-related
lung
pathology
after
virus
challenge
,
despite
its
ability
to
induce
neutralizing
antibodies
[
111
]
.
These
results
have
dampened
the
enthusiasm
of
whole-inactivated
coronavirus
vaccines
.
Nevertheless
,
recently
two
studies
have
revealed
that
UV-inactivated
SARS-CoV
adjuvanted
with
Toll-like
receptor
agonists
,
and
formaldehyde-inactivated
MERS-CoV
adjuvanted
with
alum
and
unmethylated
CpG
,
can
reduce
or
even
prevent
Th2-skewed
lung
pathology
after
challenge
[
38
,
112
]
.
These
results
demonstrated
that
with
an
appropriate
combination
of
inactivation
method
and
adjuvants
,
the
whole
inactivated
virus
is
still
a
viable
option
for
coronavirus
vaccine
development.Live
attenuated
vaccines
are
live
viruses
weakened
by
deleting
or
mutating
the
pathogenic
component
of
the
viral
genome
.
Similar
to
whole
inactivated
vaccines
,
they
possess
nearly
the
full
immunogenic
components
of
the
original
virus
.
Furthermore
,
they
preserve
the
native
conformation
of
viral
antigens
and
present
antigens
to
the
immune
system
as
in
natural
infections
.
Therefore
,
live
attenuated
vaccines
are
the
most
immunogenic
kind
of
vaccine
and
have
a
long
history
of
success
in
controlling
a
variety
of
infectious
diseases
[
113
]
.
However
,
live
attenuated
vaccines
also
carry
a
higher
risk
than
other
types
of
vaccines
,
including
the
possibility
of
reversion
to
a
virulent
state
and
the
danger
of
persistent
infection
in
immunocompromised
patients
.
Therefore
,
biosafety
of
live
attenuated
vaccines
needs
to
be
carefully
evaluated
before
proceeding
to
clinical
use.Although
a
few
SARS-CoV
and
MERS-CoV
live
attenuated
vaccines
have
demonstrated
efficacy
in
animal
models
,
none
of
them
have
proceeded
to
clinical
trials
[
114,115,116,117
]
.
The
envelope
(
E
)
protein
,
besides
its
structural
roles
,
has
a
major
role
in
inflammasome
activation
and
is
associated
with
exacerbated
inflammation
in
the
lung
[
118
]
.
As
a
result
,
the
deletion
of
E
protein
can
lead
to
the
decreased
virulence
of
coronavirus
[
119
]
.
Lamirande
et
al
.
has
reported
that
SARS-CoV
mutants
lacking
the
E
gene
can
induce
protective
effects
in
hamsters
against
SARS-CoV
challenge
[
114
]
.
In
addition
,
nonstructural
protein
16
(
nsp16
)
is
another
viable
target
for
the
coronavirus
vaccine
.
Nsp16
encodes
ribose
2′-O-methyltransferase
that
is
required
for
5′
capping
of
viral
RNA
[
120
]
.
This
methylation
helps
coronavirus
avoid
the
activation
of
type
I
interferon-dependent
innate
immune
response
by
viral
RNA
,
and
therefore
nsp16
deletion
attenuates
virulence
[
120
]
.
Both
SARS-CoV
and
MERS-CoV
nsp16
mutant
vaccines
have
been
reported
to
provide
protection
against
challenge
[
115
,
116
]
.
Moreover
,
nonstructural
protein
14
(
nsp14
)
,
which
encodes
exoribonuclease
(
ExoN
)
involved
in
RNA
proofreading
during
replication
,
is
also
an
useful
target
for
live
attenuated
coronavirus
vaccine
[
121
]
.
The
loss
of
ExoN
will
cause
a
profound
decrease
in
replication
fidelity
,
and
lead
to
attenuation
of
coronavirus
pathogenesis
[
121
]
.
Graham
et
al
.
has
shown
that
ExoN
deletion
can
reduce
SARS-CoV
virulence
in
young
,
aged
,
immunocompromised
mice
,
and
ExoN-deleted
SARS-CoV
vaccine
can
induce
a
protective
effect
against
challenge
in
these
mice
[
117
]
.
In
sum
,
all
the
targets
mentioned
above
serve
as
potential
strategies
for
the
development
of
live
attenuated
SARS-CoV-2
vaccine.Compared
with
SARS
and
MERS
,
which
tended
to
resolve
spontaneously
after
regional
outbreak
,
the
worldwide
magnitude
of
the
COVID-19
pandemic
has
made
development
of
vaccine
an
unprecedented
urgency
.
This
urgent
need
has
led
to
many
different
approaches
in
vaccine
development
considerations
.
First
of
all
,
unconventional
vaccine
platforms
,
such
as
nucleic
acid
vaccines
and
viral
vector
vaccines
,
are
becoming
the
leading
players
in
the
race
of
COVID-19
vaccine
development
due
to
their
ability
to
be
developed
using
sequence
information
alone
[
122
]
.
These
new
platforms
are
therefore
highly
adaptable
to
emerging
pathogens
,
and
their
safety
profiles
have
already
been
well
examined
in
recent
influenza
,
Ebola
and
Zika
outbreaks
[
57
]
.
Secondly
,
the
clinical
development
process
of
COVID-19
vaccine
has
been
accelerated
by
executing
trials
in
parallel
rather
than
following
a
linear
sequence
of
steps
.
For
example
,
multiple
COVID-19
vaccine
candidates
directly
entered
clinical
trials
before
having
preclinical
data
in
animal
models
,
and
many
vaccine
trials
have
adopted
an
integrated
phase
I/II
or
phase
II/III
approach
to
save
time
[
123
]
.
Last
but
not
least
,
in
order
to
meet
the
massive
global
need
of
COVID-19
vaccine
,
vaccine
developing
companies
,
especially
the
front
runners
,
are
ramping
up
their
manufacturing
capacity
to
the
scale
of
~
1
billion
doses
per
year
[
124,125,126
]
.
Governments
from
the
United
States
and
several
other
countries
are
also
playing
an
important
role
in
funding
the
scale-up
of
potentially
effective
vaccines
[
127,128,129
]
.In
this
section
,
we
will
discuss
the
latest
preclinical
and
clinical
development
of
COVID-19
vaccines
(
as
of
Oct
26
,
2020
)
.
We
will
highlight
representative
COVID-19
vaccines
from
each
major
vaccine
platform
that
have
published
clinical
data
(
Table
2
)
.Up
to
now
,
there
have
been
13
SARS-CoV-2
protein
subunit
vaccines
entering
clinical
trials
[
130
]
.
Among
these
vaccines
,
a
leading
company
Novavax
,
with
its
NVX-CoV2373
vaccine
,
has
entered
a
phase
IIb
trial
in
South
Africa
(
NCT04533399
)
and
a
phase
III
trial
in
the
UK
(
2020-004123-16
)
.
NVX-CoV2373
contains
a
prefusion
stabilized
full-length
spike
protein
adjuvanted
with
their
proprietary
saponin-based
adjuvant
[
131
,
132
]
.
In
a
preclinical
trial
,
the
vaccine
induced
neutralizing
antibodies
and
prevented
viral
replication
in
the
respiratory
tract
in
macaques
challenged
with
the
virus
[
131
]
.
The
vaccine
also
induced
binding
and
neutralizing
antibodies
in
all
participants
in
the
phase
I
trial
[
132
]
.
In
their
phase
I
trial
,
they
also
observed
a
dose
sparing
effect
by
the
adjuvant
.
They
found
that
both
adjuvanted
5
ug
and
25
ug
dose
regimens
induced
significantly
high
titers
of
neutralizing
antibody
compared
to
the
placebo
group
and
the
25
ug
dose
without
adjuvant
group
[
132
]
.
Another
vaccine
that
has
entered
the
phase
II
trial
is
Anhui
Zhifei
Longcom
’
s
recombinant
new
coronavirus
vaccine
(
NCT04466085
)
.
Instead
of
using
the
full-length
S
protein
,
Anhui
Zhifei
Longcom
’
s
vaccine
only
contains
the
RBD
of
the
SARS-CoV-2
S
protein
.
However
,
no
further
design
or
data
has
been
provided
so
far
.
For
the
other
candidate
SARS-CoV-2
protein
subunit
vaccines
,
most
of
them
also
utilize
either
full-length
S
protein
or
the
RBD
of
S
protein
as
their
vaccine
antigen
.
Notably
,
one
recent
study
has
described
a
generalizable
strategy
to
enhance
the
immunogenicity
of
protein
subunit
coronavirus
vaccines
[
133
]
.
They
identified
a
disulfide-linked
dimeric
form
of
MERS-RBD
that
is
significantly
more
immunogenic
and
protective
than
its
conventional
monomeric
counterpart
[
133
]
.
They
applied
the
same
strategy
to
SARS-CoV-2
and
has
demonstrated
a
10–100-fold
enhancement
of
neutralizing
antibody
titers
[
133
]
.
Therefore
,
this
framework
of
immunogen
design
could
be
universally
applicable
to
all
protein
subunit
coronavirus
vaccines
in
the
future.There
are
4
DNA
vaccines
for
SARS-CoV-2
currently
under
clinical
trials
[
130
]
.
Among
these
developers
,
Inovio
is
a
leading
company
that
has
published
results
on
MERS-CoV
and
SARS-CoV-2
DNA
vaccines
.
Inovio
’
s
SARS-CoV-2
DNA
vaccine
INO-4800
encodes
the
full
length
S
protein
and
is
administered
intradermally
with
a
hand-held
device
CELLECTRA
to
electroporate
the
skin
cell
[
70
,
134
]
.
Having
experience
in
the
phase
I/IIa
trial
of
their
MERS
vaccine
(
INO-4700
)
,
they
are
using
the
same
platform
for
the
SARS-CoV-2
vaccine
INO-4800
[
69
,
70
]
.
They
have
demonstrated
that
the
vaccine
induces
neutralizing
antibodies
and
Th1-skewed
immune
responses
in
animal
models
including
mice
,
guinea
pigs
,
and
rhesus
macaques
[
70
,
135
]
.
The
vaccine
is
now
in
two
phase
I/II
trial
(
NCT04447781
and
NCT04336410
)
.
The
interim
analysis
of
the
two
phase
I
trials
showed
it
induced
humoral
and
T
cell
immune
responses
in
94
%
participants
after
two
doses
while
only
caused
adverse
events
of
grade
1
or
below
[
136
]
.Although
there
were
no
RNA
vaccine
studies
for
SARS-CoV
or
MERS-CoV
in
the
past
two
decades
,
there
have
already
been
6
novel
RNA
vaccines
reaching
clinical
trials
for
SARS-CoV-2
since
the
outbreak
of
COVID-19
[
130
]
.
RNA
vaccines
consist
of
viral
antigen-encoding
messenger
RNAs
that
can
be
translated
by
human
cells
to
produce
antigenic
proteins
and
stimulate
the
immune
system
.
RNA
vaccines
are
usually
delivered
in
complex
with
additional
agents
,
such
as
protamine
or
lipid-
and
polymer-based
nanoparticles
,
to
increase
its
efficacy
[
137
]
.
Similar
to
DNA
vaccines
,
RNA
vaccines
have
the
advantages
of
being
highly
adaptable
to
new
pathogens
and
being
able
to
recapitulate
the
native
conformation
and
modifications
of
antigenic
proteins
.
Furthermore
,
compared
with
DNA
vaccines
,
RNA
vaccines
have
some
additional
benefits
.
Unlike
DNA
,
RNA
does
not
interact
with
host-cell
DNA
and
therefore
obviate
the
risks
of
genomic
integration
.
Besides
,
RNA
vaccines
can
be
given
through
multiple
routes
including
traditional
intravenous
injection
,
whereas
DNA
vaccines
need
to
be
administered
via
special
devices
like
electroporation
or
gene
gun
.
Nevertheless
,
RNA
vaccines
do
have
some
drawbacks
.
Exogenous
RNA
can
activate
interferon-mediated
antiviral
immune
response
and
lead
to
stalled
translation
and
mRNA
degradation
,
which
suppress
the
efficacy
of
RNA
vaccines
[
138
]
.
In
addition
,
interferon
signaling
is
associated
with
inflammation
and
potential
autoimmunity
[
139
]
.
Even
though
there
have
not
been
severe
cases
of
RNA
vaccine-induced
autoimmune
diseases
,
it
is
important
to
carefully
evaluate
this
potential
adverse
effect.Moderna
and
BioNTech/Pfizer
are
the
two
leading
developers
for
a
SARS-CoV-2
RNA
vaccine
.
Moderna
's
mRNA-1273
vaccine
encodes
a
stabilized
prefusion
spike
trimer
,
in
which
they
substituted
the
amino
acids
at
986
and
987
with
proline
to
stabilize
the
spike
protein
in
its
prefusion
conformation
[
140
]
.
The
nucleotides
of
the
mRNA
were
also
modified
not
only
to
increase
its
translation
and
half-life
but
also
to
prevent
activation
of
interferon-associated
genes
upon
entering
the
cell
[
140
]
.
The
preliminary
report
for
their
phase
I
clinical
trial
showed
that
:
(
1
)
neutralizing
antibodies
were
detected
in
all
45
patients
after
two
doses
of
immunization
;
(
2
)
antibody
titers
of
immunized
patients
were
higher
than
convalescent
serum
after
two
doses
of
vaccination
;
(
3
)
Th1-biased
immune
responses
were
observed
in
immunized
patients
[
140
]
.
There
were
some
cases
of
systemic
adverse
events
after
the
second
dose
of
vaccination
,
but
no
grade
4
adverse
events
were
observed
[
140
]
.
They
concluded
that
100
ug
can
induce
a
satisfactory
immune
response
and
thus
will
continue
to
use
100
ug
dosage
in
phase
III
clinical
trial
(
NCT04470427
)
[
140
]
.
In
addition
,
they
also
expanded
the
same
phase
I
trial
to
include
40
elderly
participants
with
their
age
older
than
55
years
old
[
141
]
.
Their
result
demonstrated
that
100
ug
dose
of
mRNA-1273
induced
higher
binding-
and
neutralizing-antibody
titers
than
the
25
ug
dose
,
and
the
adverse
events
associated
with
mRNA-1273
were
mild
or
moderate
in
these
elderly
participants
[
141
]
.
On
Nov
16
,
2020
,
Moderna
revealed
the
first
interim
analysis
of
their
phase
III
trial
(
NCT04470427
)
[
142
]
.
Their
result
showed
that
among
95
people
who
developed
symptomatic
COVID-19
after
volunteering
in
this
trial
,
only
5
of
them
were
from
the
mRNA-1273
group
,
and
the
rest
90
cases
were
from
the
placebo
group
,
resulting
in
a
estimated
vaccine
efficacy
of
94.5
%
[
142
]
.
In
addition
,
there
were
11
volunteers
who
developed
severe
COVID-19
symptoms
,
and
their
analysis
showed
that
all
11
cases
were
in
the
placebo
group
and
none
in
the
mRNA-1273
group
[
142
]
.
Their
concurrent
safety
review
also
did
not
notice
any
significant
safety
concern
[
142
]
.
Therefore
,
their
promising
result
suggested
that
the
mRNA-1273
vaccine
is
safe
and
effective
in
preventing
symptomatic
COVID-19
.
BioNTech
and
Pfizer
’
s
mRNA
vaccine
has
four
candidates
,
BNT162b1
,
BNT162b2
,
BNT162a1
and
BNT162c2
.
BNT162b1
and
BNT162b2
are
both
nucleoside
modified
mRNA
(
modRNA
)
vaccine
[
143
]
.
BNT162b1
encodes
a
trimerized
RBD
of
spike
protein
while
BNT162b2
encodes
a
full-length
spike
protein
[
143
]
.
On
the
other
hand
,
BNT162a1
is
a
uridine
mRNA
(
uRNA
)
-based
vaccine
and
BNT162c2
is
a
self-amplifying
mRNA
(
saRNA
)
-based
vaccine
[
143
]
.
Up
to
now
,
BioNTech
and
Pfizer
have
published
two
BNT162b1
phase
I/II
trial
results
that
were
conducted
in
Germany
(
NCT04380701
)
and
the
US
(
NCT04368728
)
,
respectively
[
144
,
145
]
.
Both
studies
showed
that
the
two-dose
regimen
of
BNT162b1
elicited
RBD-binding
and
neutralizing
antibodies
with
titers
above
convalescent
human
serum
[
144
,
145
]
.
Analysis
of
cell-mediated
immune
responses
showed
Th1-skewed
response
in
most
participants
,
as
demonstrated
by
the
detection
of
IFNγ
,
IL-2
and
IL-12
but
not
IL-4
in
their
assay
[
144
,
145
]
.
Although
the
German
trial
and
the
US
trial
used
different
dosages
of
vaccine
,
the
two
trials
agreed
with
each
other
and
showed
that
a
regimen
of
30–50
ug
on
day
1
and
day
22
is
able
to
elicit
favorable
immune
response
without
severe
adverse
effects
[
144
,
145
]
.
Following
these
two
papers
,
they
also
published
another
study
comparing
the
vaccination
responses
between
BNT162b1
and
BNT162b2
[
146
]
.
BNT162b1
and
BNT162b2
were
shown
to
induce
similar
neutralizing
titers
in
younger
and
older
adults
[
146
]
.
However
,
BNT162b2
had
less
systemic
reactogenicity
in
older
adults
[
146
]
.
Therefore
,
they
decided
to
move
forward
with
BNT162b2
instead
of
BNT162b1
into
a
phase
III
clinical
trial
(
NCT04368728
)
.
On
Nov
18
,
2020
,
Pfizer
and
BioNTech
announced
the
efficacy
analysis
of
their
phase
III
clinical
trial
(
NCT04368728
)
after
meeting
all
primary
efficacy
endpoints
[
147
]
.
Their
evaluation
showed
that
BNT162b2
is
95
%
effective
against
COVID-19
[
147
]
.
This
result
was
based
on
analyzing
170
confirmed
COVID-19
cases
,
of
which
162
cases
of
COVID-19
were
observed
in
the
placebo
group
while
8
cases
in
the
BNT162b2
group
[
147
]
.
In
addition
,
among
10
severe
COVID-19
cases
observed
in
this
trial
,
9
of
them
were
in
the
placebo
group
and
only
1
of
them
was
in
the
BNT162b2
group
[
147
]
.
Notably
,
the
observed
efficacy
in
the
elderly
people
was
over
94
%
,
which
would
help
protect
the
most
vulnerable
population
against
COVID-19
[
147
]
.
No
serious
safety
concern
was
observed
among
43,000
enrolled
participants
[
147
]
.
These
data
indicated
BNT162b2
is
another
well-tolerated
and
efficacious
COVID-19
vaccine.Currently
,
there
are
12
viral
vector
vaccines
in
clinical
trials
,
and
an
additional
36
viral
vector
vaccines
under
preclinical
development
[
130
]
.
Many
viral
vector
platforms
that
have
been
tested
in
SARS-CoV
and
MERS-CoV
are
being
explored
in
COVID-19
vaccines
,
including
adenovirus
(
both
human
and
non-human
primates
)
,
measles
virus
,
modified
vaccinia
virus
Ankara
(
MVA
)
,
parainfluenza
virus
,
rabies
virus
and
vesicular
stomatitis
virus
(
VSV
)
[
130
]
.
Surprisingly
,
Venezuelan
equine
encephalitis
(
VEE
)
virus
,
which
has
been
extensively
studied
in
SARS
and
MERS
vaccine
,
hasn
’
t
been
tested
in
any
COVID-19
vaccine
studies
yet
.
On
the
other
hand
,
influenza
virus
vector
,
which
hasn
’
t
been
explored
for
SARS
and
MERS
viral
vector
vaccines
,
are
now
gaining
popularity
for
the
development
of
COVID-19
viral
vector
vaccine
[
130
]
.
For
COVID-19
viral
vector
vaccines
that
have
entered
clinical
trials
,
8
out
of
12
are
based
on
adenoviruses
,
and
the
four
leading
candidates
in
this
platform
are
AZD1222
(
or
ChAdOx1
nCoV-19
,
developed
by
Astrazeneca
and
Oxford
University
)
,
Gam-COVID-Vac
(
or
Sputnik
V
,
or
rAd26S+rAd5-S
,
developed
by
Gamaleya
Research
Institute
)
,
Ad5
(
developed
by
CanSino
Biological
Inc.
and
Beijing
Institute
of
Biotechnology
)
,
and
Ad26
(
developed
by
Johnson
&
Johnson
and
Beth
Israel
Deaconess
Medical
Center
)
[
130
]
.AZD1222
is
a
chimpanzee
adenovirus-based
viral
vector
vaccine
(
ChAdOx1
)
expressing
SARS-CoV-2
spike
protein
[
99
]
.
This
ChAdOx1
platform
has
been
used
to
develop
MERS-CoV
vaccine
,
which
has
demonstrated
promising
preclinical
and
phase
I
clinical
trial
data
[
94,95,96,97,98
]
.
The
AZD1222
vaccine
team
published
their
phase
I/II
trial
interim
report
in
July
2020
and
showed
that
AZD1222
can
elicit
S
protein-specific
antibody
and
T-cell
response
and
induce
neutralizing
antibody
in
all
participants
after
the
prime-boost
regimen
[
99
]
.
No
severe
adverse
effect
has
been
observed
[
99
]
.
Based
on
this
promising
data
,
AZD1222
launched
phase
II/III
trials
in
UK
(
2020-001228-32
)
and
phase
III
trials
in
Brazil
(
ISRCTN89951424
)
,
United
States
(
NCT04516746
)
,
Russia
(
NCT04540393
)
and
India
(
CTRI/2020/08/027170
)
.
In
Sep
2020
,
the
AZD1222
phase
II/III
trial
in
the
UK
was
once
put
on
hold
for
safety
review
because
a
participant
has
developed
unexplained
illness
,
but
following
later
independent
review
in
the
UK
determined
that
the
trial
is
still
safe
and
therefore
the
AZD1222
clinical
trial
resumed
[
148
,
149
]
.
On
Nov
23
,
2020
,
Astrazeneca
annouced
the
interim
analysis
of
their
clinical
trial
in
UK
(
2020-001228-32
)
and
Brazil
(
ISRCTN89951424
)
[
150
]
.
Their
pooled
result
showed
that
AZD1222
has
an
average
efficacy
of
70
%
,
based
on
analyzing
a
total
of
131
COVID-19
cases
from
11,636
volunteers
[
150
]
.
Interestingly
,
one
dose
regimen
showed
90
%
efficacy
when
AZD1222
was
given
as
half
first
dose
followed
by
a
full
second
dose
(
n
=
2,741
)
[
150
]
.
On
the
other
hand
,
two
full
dose
regimen
had
only
62
%
efficacy
(
n
=
8,895
)
[
150
]
.
Due
to
the
response
discrepancy
between
different
subgroups
,
additional
trials
may
be
needed
to
better
determine
the
efficacy
and
the
most
suitable
regimen
of
AZD1222
.
In
addition
,
the
Gam-COVID-Vac
vaccine
team
has
published
their
phase
I/II
trial
results
[
151
]
.
They
conducted
two
different
trials
,
with
one
using
frozen
formulation
(
NCT04436471
)
and
the
other
using
lyophilized
formulation
(
NCT04437875
)
of
the
vaccine
[
151
]
.
In
both
phase
II
trials
,
they
tested
their
patients
with
heterologous
prime-boost
immunization
of
recombinant
adenovirus
type
26
vector
encoding
SARS-CoV-2
spike
glycoprotein
(
rAd26-S
)
plus
recombinant
adenovirus
type
5
vector
encoding
SARS-CoV-2
spike
glycoprotein
(
rAd5-S
)
[
151
]
.
Their
results
showed
that
both
frozen
and
lyophilized
formulation
of
the
vaccine
induced
potent
neutralizing
antibodies
and
CD4+
and
CD8+
T-cell
immune
responses
,
with
the
immune
response
of
frozen
formulation
being
slightly
stronger
than
the
lyophilized
formulation
[
151
]
.
Both
vaccines
were
safe
and
well-tolerated
in
all
participants
[
151
]
.
Now
this
vaccine
is
also
entering
phase
III
trial
in
Russia
(
NCT04530396
)
and
Belarus
(
NCT04564716
)
.
On
Nov
24
,
2020
,
Gamaleya
Research
Institute
announced
the
second
interim
analysis
of
Gam-COVID-Vac
(
or
Sputnik
V
)
phase
III
clinical
trial
(
NCT04530396
)
[
152
]
.
Their
result
showed
that
Gam-COVID-Vac
had
a
efficacy
of
91.4
%
on
Day
28
after
the
first
dose
,
which
was
based
on
analyzing
39
confirmed
cases
among
18,794
volunteers
[
152
]
.
They
also
revealed
that
on
Day
42
after
the
first
dose
(
Day
21
after
the
second
dose
)
,
the
vaccine
efficacy
was
even
above
95
%
[
152
]
.
There
were
no
unexpected
adverse
effect
documented
during
the
trial
[
152
]
.
These
promising
results
suggested
that
Gam-COVID-Vac
is
safe
and
effective
in
preventing
COVID-19
.
Furthermore
,
the
Ad5
vaccine
team
,
whose
vaccine
is
based
on
human
adenovirus
5
,
has
also
published
their
clinical
data
[
92
,
93
]
.
In
their
phase
II
study
,
Ad5-vectored
COVID-19
vaccine
induces
significant
neutralizing
antibodies
and
T-cell
mediated
immune
response
after
single
immunization
[
93
]
.
They
tested
two
dosage
,
1
×
1011
and
5
×
1010
viral
particles
,
and
showed
that
the
5
×
1010
dose
causes
less
severe
adverse
reactions
without
compromising
the
immunogenicity
[
93
]
.
Now
this
vaccine
has
advance
to
two
phase
III
global
multi-centered
clinical
trials
(
NCT04526990
and
NCT04540419
)
.
Finally
,
Johnson
&
Johnson
’
s
Ad26-based
COVID-19
vaccine
has
also
entered
phase
III
clinical
trial
(
NCT04505722
)
,
but
no
data
from
its
earlier
trial
has
been
reported
yet.Currently
,
there
are
7
whole
inactivated
COVID-19
vaccine
in
clinical
trials
[
130
]
.
From
the
previous
experience
of
SARS-CoV
and
MERS-CoV
vaccine
development
,
whole
inactivated
virus
can
induce
adverse
effect
such
as
eosinophil-related
lung
immunopathology
in
preclinical
models
[
36
,
37
]
.
Even
though
no
serious
adverse
effect
has
been
reported
for
whole-inactivated
COVID-19
vaccine
,
it
is
important
for
the
research
community
to
keep
this
in
mind
and
carefully
evaluate
potential
adverse
effects
.
For
all
ongoing
trials
of
whole
inactivated
COVID-19
vaccine
,
three
of
them
have
publicly
reported
their
preclinical
or
clinical
data
.
SinoVac
Inc.
developed
CoronaVac
(
also
known
as
PiCoVacc
)
,
which
is
a
beta-propiolactone
inactivated
,
Vero
cell
line
propagated
whole
virus
vaccine
originated
from
a
patient-derived
CN-2
SARS-CoV-2
virus
strain
[
153
]
.
In
their
preclinical
study
,
PiCoVacc
induces
broad
neutralizing
antibodies
against
10
representative
SARS-CoV-2
strains
in
mice
,
rats
,
and
non-human
primates
[
153
]
.
Immunizing
macaques
with
three
doses
of
PiCoVacc
provides
them
with
protective
immunity
against
SARS-CoV-2
challenge
without
causing
any
antibody-dependent
enhancement
effect
[
153
]
.
Following
their
preclinical
study
,
CoronaVac
has
completed
two
phase
I/II
trials
(
NCT04383574
and
NCT04352608
,
result
not
yet
published
)
and
is
now
starting
phase
III
clinical
trial
in
Brazil
(
NCT04456595
)
,
Indonesia
(
669/UN6.KEP/EC/2020
)
and
Turkey
(
NCT04582344
)
.
In
addition
,
Sinopharm
Inc.
and
Wuhan
Institute
of
Biological
Products
have
developed
a
different
COVID-19
inactivated
virus
vaccine
(
no
specific
product
name
)
.
In
this
vaccine
,
WIV04
strain
was
isolated
from
a
COVID-19
patient
in
Wuhan
,
propagated
in
Vero
cells
,
and
followed
by
two
rounds
of
beta-propiolactone
inactivation
[
154
]
.
They
tested
three
different
dosage
and
three
different
injection
timelines
in
their
phase
I
and
phase
II
studies
,
and
their
phase
I/II
interim
report
showed
that
patients
receiving
different
vaccination
regimen
all
had
demonstrated
neutralizing
antibodies
and
with
only
a
low
rate
of
adverse
reactions
[
154
]
.
Now
they
have
launched
a
phase
III
clinical
trial
in
United
Arab
Emirates
(
ChiCTR2000034780
)
and
Kuwait
(
ChiCTR2000039000
)
.
Finally
,
Sinopharm
Inc.
also
collaborated
with
Beijing
Institute
of
Biological
Products
to
develop
another
COVID-19
inactivated
virus
vaccine
BBIBP-CorV
[
155
,
156
]
.
The
manufacturing
process
of
BBIBP-CorV
is
very
similar
to
the
other
vaccine
Sinopharm
Inc.
produced
,
except
that
BBIBP-CorV
used
a
different
HB02
strain
rather
than
WIV04
strain
[
155
]
.
They
have
tested
BBIBP-CorV
in
preclinical
models
and
showed
that
two-dose
immunization
of
BBIBP-CorV
can
protect
rhesus
macaques
from
SARS-CoV-2
challenge
[
155
]
.
Following
this
,
they
completed
a
clinical
phase
I/II
trial
with
BBIBP-CorV
and
demonstrated
that
BBIBP-CorV
is
safe
and
well-tolerated
in
all
tested
doses
in
two
age
groups
[
156
]
.
Furthermore
,
their
immunogenicity
result
showed
that
humoral
responses
against
SARS-CoV-2
were
induced
in
all
vaccine
recipients
42
days
after
immunization
[
156
]
.
Now
this
vaccine
is
under
phase
III
clinical
trial
in
United
Arab
Emirates
(
ChiCTR2000034780
)
and
Argentina
(
NCT04560881
)
.There
are
also
several
other
COVID-19
vaccine
candidates
using
different
technologies
other
than
the
platforms
mentioned
above
.
Virus-like
particle-based
vaccine
,
which
has
been
demonstrated
to
induce
humoral
and
cell-mediated
immunity
in
SARS-CoV
and
MERS-CoV
preclinical
models
,
has
one
candidate
COVID-19
vaccine
in
phase
I
clinical
trial
(
NCT04450004
)
and
14
vaccine
candidates
under
preclinical
development
[
130
]
.
However
,
none
of
the
group
has
publicly
reported
their
vaccine
studies
yet
.
Live
attenuated
vaccine
,
which
has
been
shown
to
provide
protective

challenged
mice
,
has
3
preclinical
ongoing
studies
[

.
The
higher
risk
of
adverse
effect
has
made
live
attenuated
vaccine
a
less
appealing
choice
for
the
time-sensitive
race
of
COVID-19
vaccine
development
.
Nevertheless
,
if
successfully
developed
,
live
attenuated
vaccine
can
provide
the
most
potent
protective
effect
due
to
its
high
similarity
to
natural
infection.In
addition
to
these
traditional
platforms
,
scientists
have
also
developed
COVID-19
vaccines
using
unconventional
approaches
.
Aivita
Biomedical
,
Inc.
has
developed
AV-COVID-19
,
which
is
an
autologous
dendritic
cells
vaccine
loaded
with
SARS-CoV-2
antigens
[
157
]
.
AV-COVID-19
is
derived
from
patients
’
own
peripheral
blood
monocytes
,
then
differentiated
in
vitro
into
dendritic
cells
,
and
incubated
with
SARS-CoV-2
antigens
before
injecting
back
into
patients
’
blood
[
157
]
.
Now
the
company
has
launched
a
phase
I/II
clinical
trial
to
evaluate
its
safety
and
efficacy
profile
in
adults
(
NCT04386252
)
.
Besides
,
Symvivo
Corporation
has
developed
bacTRL-Spike
,
a
live
Bifidobacterium
vaccine
engineered
to
deliver
synthetic
plasmid
DNA
encoding
spike
protein
from
SARS-CoV-2
.
They
have
also
registered
a
phase
I
clinical
trial
to
examine
the
safety
of
this
vaccine
(
NCT04334980
)
.
Moreover
,
a
group
from
Nanjing
University
has
found
that
a
plant
microRNA
,
MIR2911
,
can
target
SARS-CoV-2
by
binding
to
their
mRNA
and
blocking
protein
translation
[
158
]
.
Their
data
showed
that
MIR2911
inhibited
SARS-CoV-2
replication
and
accelerated
negative
conversion
of
infected
patients
[
158
]
.
Following
their
study
,
they
are
now
launching
a
phase
I
clinical
trial
(
ChiCTR2000031432
)
in
China
to
evaluate
the
safety
and
tolerance
of
MIR2911
in
patients.Finally
,
people
have
been
testing
existing
licensed
vaccines
and
trying
to
repurpose
them
to
combat
COVID-19
.
It
has
been
shown
that
tuberculosis
vaccine
bacillus
Calmette–Guérin
(
BCG
)
can
train
innate
immunity
and
induce
nonspecific
host
defensive
reaction
against
viral
pathogens
,
including
respiratory
syncytial
virus
(
RSV
)
,
influenza
A
virus
and
herpes
simplex
virus
type
2
(
HSV2
)
[
159,160,161,162
]
.
Additionally
,
an
interesting
study
compared
the
national
difference
in
COVID-19
impact
and
correlated
it
with
national
BCG
vaccination
policy
[
163
]
.
They
found
that
countries
without
universal
policies
of
BCG
vaccination
have
been
more
severely
affected
compared
to
countries
with
universal
and
long-standing
BCG
policies
[
163
]
.
Based
on
these
rationales
,
there
have
been
at
least
13
phase
III
clinical
trials
testing
whether
BCG
vaccine
can
reduce
the
morbidity
and
mortality
of
healthcare
workers
(
NCT04328441
,
NCT04327206
,
NCT04350931
,
NCT04348370
,
NCT04362124
,
NCT04369794
,
NCT04373291
,
NCT04379336
,
NCT04384549
,
NCT04439045
,
NCT04387409
,
NCT04417335
,
NCT04414267
)
.Given
the
rapid
transmission
and
asymptomatic
spread
of
COVID-19
,
it
is
clear
that
an
effective
vaccine
with
global
immunization
coverage
is
required
to
bring
people
’
s
lives
back
to
normalcy
.
However
,
even
when
an
effective
SARS-CoV-2
vaccine
becomes
available
,
the
duration
of
vaccine-induced
immunity
is
still
largely
unknown
.
Previous
SARS
studies
have
shown
that
SARS-specific
IgG
and
neutralizing
antibodies
were
only
maintained
for
approximately
2
years
in
patients
who
recovered
from
SARS-CoV
infection
[
164
,
165
]
.
As
a
result
,
permanent
immunity
is
less
likely
to
be
the
case
for
COVID-19
vaccines
,
and
a
regular
vaccination
policy
might
be
required
in
the
future
.
In
addition
,
it
is
still
unclear
what
is
the
minimal
neutralizing
antibody
titer
that
can
provide
protective
effect
against
SARS-CoV-2
infection
.
It
is
believed
that
the
higher
neutralizing
antibody
vaccination
induces
,
the
better
protective
effect
it
will
be
.
This
is
consistent
with
the
observation
that
most
COVID-19
reinfection
cases
only
experience
mild
or
no
symptom
during
their
first
infection
,
which
might
not
be
sufficient
to
induce
strong
neutralizing
antibodies
[
166
,
167
]
.
Therefore
,
it
is
of
great
importance
that
further
studies
characterize
the
correlation
between
neutralizing
antibody
and
protective
effect
to
guide
COVID-19
vaccine
development
.
Last
but
not
least
,
various
mutations
have
been
detected
in
the
SARS-CoV-2
genome
,
with
D614G
mutation
being
the
most
prevalent
one
[
168
]
.
D614G
is
a
missense
point
mutation
in
S
protein
that
increases
the
infectivity
of
SARS-CoV-2
by
decreasing
S1
shedding
and
increasing
S
protein
incorporation
into
virion
[
169
,
170
]
.
Fortunately
,
D614G
mutation
does
not
prevent
neutralizing
antibodies
from
binding
to
SARS-CoV-2
and
thus
does
not
provide
resistance
to
vaccination
[
170
]
.
However
,
it
is
possible
that
such
immune-escaping
mutations
appears
in
the
future
and
makes
COVID-19
vaccine
development
even
more
difficult.Since
the
discovery
of
human
coronaviruses
in
1960s
,
new
types
of
coronaviruses
have
kept
emerging
and
have
gradually
become
a
serious
threat
to
global
public
health
.
Even
though
there
have
been
almost
two
decades
since
the
first
coronavirus
outbreak
,
the
scientific
and
medical
community
are
not
well
prepared
with
effective
weapons
to
combat
these
pathogens
.
One
lesson
we
learned
from
this
is
that
the
financial
and
regulatory
mechanism
of
current
pharmaceutical
market
does
not
provide
enough
incentive
to
encourage
vaccine
development
before
a
deadly
outbreak
happens
.
To
make
up
for
this
,
now
academic
institutions
and
companies
all
over
the
world
are
developing
an
explosive
numbers
of
vaccine
candidates
with
highly
compressed
clinical
trial
schedules
.
Fortunately
,
the
biological
and
clinical
lessons
we
learned
from
SARS-CoV
and
MERS-CoV
researches
,
together
with
the
vaccine
development
experience
we
gained
from
other
diseases
,
have
already
guided
us
to
come
up
with
multiple
promising
candidate
solutions
.
Besides
,
multiple
therapeutic
candidates
targeting
molecules
in
SARS-CoV-2
life
cycle
and
human
immune
response
against
COVID-19
have
also
been
rapidly
explored
,
with
Remdesivir
and
Dexamethasone
being
the
two
leading
drugs
that
showed
promising
clinical
evidences
in
shortening
the
time
to
recovery
and
decreasing
mortality
rates
[
171
,
172
]
.
These
treatment
options
can
be
complementary
to
SARS-CoV-2
vaccines
to
achieve
overall
mitigation
of
the
COVID-19
pandemic
.
In
conclusion
,
we
hope
countries
all
over
the
world
,
regardless
of
political
ideologies
,
can
unite
and
work
together
to
achieve
fast
and
successful
COVID-19
vaccine
development
in
the
near
future.Not

This
chart
illustrates
how
protective
measures
such
as
limiting
travel
,
avoiding
crowds
,
social
distancing
,
and
thorough
and
frequent
handwashing
can
slow
down
the
development
of
new
COVID-19
cases
and
reduce
the
risk
of
overwhelming
the
health
care
system.According
to
new
guidance
from
the
CDC
,
fully
vaccinated
people
can
now
participate
in
all
indoor
and
outdoor
activities
without
a
mask
and
without
physical
distancing
.
For
people
who
are
not
fully
vaccinated
,
the
CDC
continues
to
recommend
mask
wearing
and
other
preventive
measures
in
some
outdoor
settings
and
in
most
indoor
settings.If
you
have
a
weakened
immune
system
due
to
a
medical
condition
or
to
medications
you
are
taking
,
you
may
be
less
protected
by
the
vaccine
and
thus
at
increased
risk
when
you
are
around
others
who
have
not
been
vaccinated
.
Talk
to
your
doctor
to
find
out
what
safety
measures
you
should
continue
to
take.Whether
you
’
re
vaccinated
or
not
,
you
’

need
to
follow
federal
,
state
,
tribal
,
and
local
laws
,
and
workplace
or
business
requirements
around
mask
wearing
and
physical

CDC
has
created
a
helpful
chart
illustrating
the
protection
vaccination
provides
in
all
outdoor
and
indoor
activities
,
and
what
prevention
measures
you
still
need
to
take
if
you
are
not
vaccinated
.

and
after

anything
that

coronavirus
spreads
mainly
from
person
to
person
.
A
person
infected
with
coronavirus
—
even
one
with
no
symptoms
—
may
emit
aerosols
when
they
talk
or
breathe
.
Aerosols
are
infectious
viral
particles
that
can
float
or
drift
around
in
the
air
for
up
to
three
hours
.
Another
person
can
breathe
in
these
aerosols
and
become
infected
with
the
coronavirus.This
can
happen
between
people
who
are
in
close
contact
with
one
another
.
Droplets
that
are
produced
when
an
infected
person
coughs
or
sneezes
may
land
in
the
mouths
or
noses
of
people
who
are
nearby
,
or
possibly
be
inhaled
into
their
lungs.Transmission
is
less
likely
to
happen
outdoors
,
where
air
currents
scatter
and
dilute
the
virus
,
than
in
a
home
,
office
,
or
other
confined
space
with
limited
air
circulation
.
Even
outdoors
,
people
who
are
not
fully
vaccinated
should
follow
CDC
guidance
on
masking
and
physical
distancing
,
to
reduce
risk
even
further.The
risk
of
spread
from
contact
with
contaminated
surfaces
or
objects
is
considered
to
be
extremely
low
.
According
to
the
CDC
,
each
contact
with
a
contaminated
surface
has
less
than
a
1
in
10,000
chance
of
causing
an
infection.The
virus
may
be
shed
in
saliva
,
semen
,
and
feces
;
whether
it
is
shed
in
vaginal
fluids
is
n't
known
.
Kissing
can
transmit
the
virus
.
Transmission
of
the
virus
through
feces
,
or
during
vaginal
or
anal
intercourse
or
oral
sex
,
appears
to
be
extremely
unlikely
at
this
time.Anyone
who
comes
into
close
contact
with
someone
who
has
COVID-19
is
at
increased
risk
of
becoming
infected
themselves
,
and
of
potentially
infecting
others
.
Contact
tracing
can
help
prevent
further
transmission
of
the
virus
by
quickly
identifying
and
informing
people
who
may
be
infected
and
contagious
,
so
they
can
take
steps
to
not
infect
others.Contact
tracing
begins
with
identifying
everyone
that
a
person
recently
diagnosed
with
COVID-19
has
been
in
contact
with
since
they
became
contagious
.
In
the
case
of
COVID-19
,
a
person
may
be
contagious
48
to
72
hours
before
they
started
to
experience
symptoms.The
contacts
are
notified
about
their
exposure
.
They
may
be
told
what
symptoms
to
look
out
for
,
advised
to
isolate
themselves
for
a
period
of
time
,
and
to
seek
medical
attention
as
needed
if
they
start
to
experience
symptoms.The
COVID-19
virus
primarily
spreads
when
one
person
breathes
in
droplets
or
aerosols
that
are
produced
when
an
infected
person
coughs
,
sneezes
,
talks
,
or
breathes.Physical
distancing
refers
to
actions
taken
to
stop
or
slow
down
the
spread
of
a
contagious
disease
.
For
an
individual
,
it
refers
to
maintaining
enough
distance
(
6
feet
or
more
)
between
yourself
and
another
person
to
avoid
getting
infected
or
infecting
someone
else
.
Directives
to
work
from
home
,
and
cancelling
meetings
and
larger
events
help
enforce
physical
distancing
at
a
community
level.The
CDC
has
expanded
how
it
defines
close
contacts
of
someone
with
COVID-19
.
Until
this
point
,
the
CDC
had
defined
a
close
contact
as
someone
who
spent
15
or
more
consecutive
minutes
within
six
feet
of
someone
with
COVID-19
.
According
to
the
new
definition
,
a
close
contact
is
someone
who
spends
15
minutes
or
more
within
six
feet
of
a
person
with
COVID-19
over
a
period
of
24
hours.Close
contacts
are
at
increased
risk
of
infection
.
When
a
person
tests
positive
for
COVID-19
,
contact
tracers
may
identify
their
close
contacts
and
urge
them
to
quarantine
to
prevent
further
spread
.
Based
on
the
new
definition
,
more
people
will
now
be
considered
close
contacts.Many
factors
can
affect
the
chances
that
infection
will
spread
from
one
person
to
another
.
These
factors
include
whether
or
one
or
both
people
are
wearing
masks
,
whether
the
infected
person
is
coughing
or
showing
other
symptoms
,
and
whether
the
encounter
occurred
indoors
or
outdoors
.
Though
the
``
15
minutes
within
six
feet
rule
''
is
a
helpful
guideline
,
it
's
always
best
to
minimize
close
interactions
with
people
who
are
not
members
of
your
household.The
CDC
's
new
definition
was
influenced
by
a
case
described
in
the
CDC's
Morbidity
and
Mortality
Weekly
Report
in
which
a
correctional
officer
in
Vermont
is
believed
to
have
been
infected
after
being
within
six
feet
for
17
non-consecutive
minutes
of
six
asymptomatic
individuals
,
all
of
whom
later
tested
positive
for
COVID-19.Try
to
stock
at
least
a
30-day
supply
of
any
needed
prescriptions
.
If
your
insurance
permits
90-day
refills
,
that
's
even
better
.

sure
you
also

The
coronavirus
that
causes
COVID-19
is
primarily
transmitted
through
droplets
containing
virus
,
or
through
viral
particles
that
float
in
the
air
.
The
virus
may
be
breathed
in
directly
and
can
also
spread
when
a
person
touches
a
surface
or
object
that
has
the
virus
on
it
and
then
touches
their
mouth
,
nose
,
or
eyes
.
There
is
no
current
evidence
that
the
COVID-19
virus
is
transmitted
through
food.Safety
precautions
help
you
avoid
breathing
in
coronavirus
or
touching
a
contaminated
surface
and
touching
your
face.In
the
grocery
store
,
maintain
at
least
six
feet
of
distance
between
yourself
and
other
shoppers
.
Wipe
frequently
touched
surfaces
like
grocery
carts
or
basket
handles
with
disinfectant
wipes
.
Avoid
touching
your
face
.
Wearing
a
cloth
mask
helps
remind
you
not
to
touch
your
face
and
can
further
help
reduce
spread
of
the
virus
.
Use
hand
sanitizer
before
leaving
the
store
.
Wash
your
hands
as
soon
as
you
get
home.If
you
are
older
than
65
or
at
increased
risk
for
any
reason
,
and
you
have
not
yet
been
vaccinated
,
limit
trips
to
the
grocery
store
.
Ask
a
neighbor
or
friend
to
pick
up
groceries
and
leave
them
outside
your
house
.
See
if
your
grocery
store
offers
special
hours
for
older
adults
or
those
with
underlying
conditions
.
Or
have
groceries
delivered
to
your
home.Wear
masks
as
advised
by
the
CDC
.
Physically
distance
.
Socialize
outdoors
.
Avoid
crowded
indoor
spaces
.
Wash
your
hands
frequently
.
If
you
are
not
fully
vaccinated
,
these
are
essential
precautions
you
should
take
to
reduce
your
risk
of
catching
or
spreading
coronavirus.But
what
about
some
other
precautions
you
may
be
taking
?
Do
they
help
,
or
is
it
okay
to
let
them
go
?
Let
's
take
a
look.You
do
n't
need
to
wear
gloves
when
running
errands
.
It
's
true
that
a
person
can
get
infected
if
they
touch
a
surface
or
object
that
has
viral
particles
on
it
,
then
touch
their
mouth
,
nose
,
or
eyes
.
But
this
is
not
the
main
way
the
virus
spreads
.
What
's
more
,
gloves
wo
n't
prevent
this
type
of
transmission
,
and
may
even
make
it
more
likely
that
you
will
touch
your
face
.
Instead
,
wash
your
hands
before
you
leave
the
house
,
use
hand
sanitizer
when
you
're
out
and
about
,
and
wash
your
hands
again
when
you
get
back
home
.
In
between
,
try
to
avoid
touching
your
face.You
do
n't
need
to
disinfect
groceries
or
takeout
containers
.
The
risk
of
infection
from
food
or
food
packaging
is
very
small
.
The
CDC
advises
against
using
disinfectant
intended
for
hard
surfaces
on
cardboard
or
other
grocery
items
,
which
can
absorb
the
chemicals
.
If
you
are
concerned
about
takeout
,
transfer
food
to
your
own
serving
dishes
.
And
wash
your
hands
and
disinfect
your
counters
after
putting
away
your
groceries
or
handling
takeout
containers.Your
mail
can
come
out
of
quarantine
.
Mail
does
not
pose
a
large
risk
,
and
putting
your
mail
aside
for
several
days
before
opening
it
is
unnecessary
.
Once
again
,
your
best
bet
is
to
wash
your
hands
after
handling
anything
you
bring
in
from
outside.You
can
invite
your
cleaners
back
into
your
home
.
If
your
cleaners
are
not
fully
vaccinated
,
request
that
they
wear
masks
the
entire
time
they
are
in
your
home
.
If
you
are
not
fully
vaccinated
,
leave
the
house
while
the
cleaners
are
present
if
you
can
;
otherwise
,
move
to
a
different
part
of
the
house
and
close
the
door
.
Open
windows
to
increase
airflow
throughout
the
house.It
's
okay
to
go
for
a
swim
.
Pools
are
relatively
safe
,
because
the
coronavirus
does
n't
spread
through
water
and
chlorine
is
a
disinfectant
.
If
you
are
not
vaccinated
,
try
to
maintain
physical
distancing
in
crowded
pools
,
but
do
n't
wear
cloth
masks
in
the
water
:
they
are
difficult
to
breathe
through
when
wet
.
Do
wear
a
mask
when
changing
if
you
are
not
vaccinated
,
and
minimize
time
in
changing
rooms
,
which
are
often
crowded
and
not
well
ventilated.Try
to
look
at
this
period
of
social
distancing
as
an
opportunity
to
get
to
things
you
've
been
meaning
to
do.Though
you
might
be
avoiding
the
gym
right
now
,
that
does
n't
mean
you
ca
n't
exercise
.
Take
long
walks
or
run
outside
(
do
your
best
to
maintain
at
least
six
feet
between
you
and
non-family
members
when
you
're
outside
)
.
Do
some
yoga
or
other
indoor
exercise
routines
when
the
weather
is
n't
cooperating.Kids
need
exercise
too
,
so
try
to
get
them
outside
every
day
for
walks
or
a
backyard
family
soccer
game
(
remember
,
this
is
n't
the
time
to
invite
the
neighborhood
kids
over
to
play
)
.Pull
out
board
games
that
are
gathering
dust
on
your
shelves
.
Have
family
movie
nights
.
Catch
up
on
books
you
've
been
meaning
to
read
,
or
do
a
family
read-aloud
every
evening.It
's
important
to
stay
connected
even
though
we
should
not
do
so
in
person
.
Keep
in
touch
virtually
through
phone
calls
,
Skype
,
Zoom
,
video
,
and
other
social
media
.
Enjoy
a
leisurely
chat
with
an
old
friend
you
've
been
meaning
to
call.If
all
else
fails
,
go
to
bed
early
and
get
some
extra
sleep
!
The
coronavirus
that
causes
COVID-19
is
primarily
transmitted
through
viral
particles
that
float
in
the
air
or
through
droplets
containing
virus
.
Even
people
who
are
infected
but
do
not
have
symptoms
,
or
have
not
yet
developed
symptoms
,
can
infect
others
.
Masks
help
minimize
spread
,
which
is
why
the
CDC
has
long
advised
mask
wearing
,
in
addition
to
physical
distancing.But
in
May
2021
,
the
CDC
revised
their
guidance
about
mask
wearing
,
tailoring
their
advice
depending
on
a
person
's
vaccination
status
,
along
with
the
nature
and
location
of
the
activity
.
There
are
a
couple
of
reasons
for
this
.
First
,
we
've
learned
that
transmission
is
much
less
likely
to
occur
outdoors
,
where
air
currents
are
more
likely
to
scatter
and
dilute
the
virus
.
In
addition
,
more
and
more
people
have
been
vaccinated
.
Those
who
are
vaccinated
are
not
only
protecting
themselves
from
infection
,
they
also
appear
less
likely
to
infect
others
.
According
to
the
new
CDC
guidance
,
fully
vaccinated
people
can
now
participate
in
all
indoor
and
outdoor
activities
without
a
mask
and
without
physical
distancing
.
For
people
who
are
not
fully
vaccinated
,
the
CDC
continues
to
recommend
mask
wearing
and
other
preventive
measures
in
some
outdoors
settings
and
in
most
indoor
settings.The
CDC
has
created
a
helpful
chart
illustrating
the
protection
vaccination
provides
in
all
outdoor
and
indoor
activities
and
what
prevention
measures
you
still
need
to
take
if
you
are
not
vaccinated
.
To
view
the
chart
,
click
here.What
kind
of
mask
should
you
wear
?
The
CDC
recommends
masks
made
of
two
or
more
layers
of
washable
,
breathable
fabric
.
Surgical
masks
are
also
effective
.
Make
sure
the
mask
completely
covers
your
nose
and
mouth
and
fits
snugly
against
the
sides
of
your
face
without
leaving
any
gaps.While
N95
masks
are
the
most
effective
,
these
medical-grade
masks
should
be
reserved
for
healthcare
workers.Surgical
masks
are
preferred
if
you
are
caring
for
someone
who
has
COVID-19.The
CDC
has
information
on
how
to
make
,
wear
,
and
clean
nonsurgical
masks.The
WHO
offers
videos
and
illustrations
on
when
and
how
to
use
a
mask.In
situations
where
you
need
to
wear
a
mask
,
double
masking
is
still
a
good
idea
.
A
lab
study
published
in
MMWR
observed
masked
and
unmasked
dummies
that
released
aerosol
particles
from
a
mouthpiece
when
they
were
simulated
to
cough
or
breathe
.
The
study
found
that
wearing
a
multilayered
cloth
mask
over
a
surgical
mask
or
wearing
a
tightly
fitted
surgical
mask
substantially
increased
the
level
of
protection
for
both
the
mask
wearer
and
others.When
double
masking
,
the
CDC
recommends
wearing
a
snug
cloth
mask
over
a
surgical
mask
.
Surgical
masks
provide
better
filtration
,
but
tend
to
fit
loosely
.
Cloth
masks
close
any
gaps
and
provide
another
layer
of
protection
.
Surgical
masks
are
sometimes
called
medical
masks
or
medical
procedure
masks.Adjusting
a
surgical
mask
for
a
tighter
fit
using
a
method
called
``
knotting
and
tucking
''
also
offers
good
protection
.
To
knot
and
tuck
a
surgical
mask
,
knot
the
ear
loops
of
a
3-ply
face
mask
where
they
join
the
edge
of
the
mask
,
then
fold
and
tuck
the
unneeded
material
under
the
edges
.

on
how
to

and

mask

.
Mask
fitters
,
or
mask
braces
,
which
are
worn
over
a
cloth
or
surgical
mask
,
can
also
improve
mask
fit.In
the
CDC
's
lab
study
,
double
masking
or
tight-fitting
surgical
masks
reduced
both
transmission
of
and
exposure
to
aerosols
by
about
95
%
compared
to
no
masking.We
know
that
wearing
masks
can
help
prevent
the
spread
of
coronavirus
by
blocking
droplets
that
are
emitted
when
someone
coughs
,
sneezes
,
talks
,
or
breathes
.
But
which
masks
are
best
and
worst
?
Researchers
at
Duke
University
created
a
simple
setup
that
allowed
them
to
count
the
number
of
droplet
particles
released
when
people
spoke
the
phrase
``
Stay
healthy
,
people
''
five
times
in
a
row
.
First
,
the
study
participants
spoke
without
a
mask
,
and
then
they
repeated
the
same
words
,
each
time
wearing
one
of
14
different
types
of
face
masks
and
coverings.As
expected
,
medical
grade
N95
masks
performed
best
,
meaning
that
the
fewest
number
of
droplets
got
through
.
They
were
followed
by
surgical
masks
.
Several
masks
made
of
polypropylene
,
a
cotton/propylene
blend
,
and
2-layer
cotton
masks
sewn
in
different
styles
also
performed
well.Gaiters
ranked
dead
last
.
Also
called
neck
fleeces
,
gaiters
tend
to
be
made
of
lightweight
fabric
and
are
often
worn
by
athletes
.
Bandanas
also
ranked
poorly.A
couple
of
simple
tests
can
help
you
gauge
the
effectiveness
of
your
mask
:
If
you
can
see
through
your
mask
when
you
hold
it
up
to
the
light
,
or
can
breathe
through
it
easily
,
it
's
probably
not
doing
much
to
prevent
spread.We
've
known
for
some
time
that
masks
help
prevent
people
from
spreading
the
coronavirus
to
others
.
Based
on
an
analysis
of
existing
information
,
a
new
study
contends
that
masks
may
also
protect
mask
wearers
from
becoming
infected
themselves.Different
masks
,
writes
the
study
author
,
block
viral
particles
to
varying
degrees
.
If
masks
lead
to
lower
``
doses
''
of
virus
being
inhaled
,
then
fewer
people
may
become
infected
,
and
those
who
do
may
have
milder
illness.Researchers
in
China
experimented
with
hamsters
to
test
the
effect
of
masks
.
They
put
healthy
hamsters
and
hamsters
infected
with
SARS-CoV-2
(
the
COVID-19
coronavirus
)
in
a
cage
,
and
separated
some
of
the
healthy
and
infected
hamsters
with
a
barrier
made
of
surgical
masks
.
Many
of
the
``
masked
''
healthy
hamsters
did
not
get
infected
,
and
those
who
did
got
less
sick
than
previously
healthy
``
maskless
''
hamsters.A
similar
experiment
can
not
ethically
be
done
in
humans
.
But
researchers
have
studied
doses
of
flu
virus
and
found
that
people
who
inhaled
a
higher
dose
of
flu
virus
were
more
likely
to
get
sick
and
experience
symptoms
.
Observations
of
coronavirus
outbreaks
in
processing
plants
and
on
cruise
ships
also
support
the
idea
that
masks
may
help
protect
mask
wearers.Without
more
research
,
we
ca
n't
be
certain
that
masks
protect
the
wearer
.
But
we
do
know
they
do
n't
hurt
,
and
that
they
protect
others.According
to
a
study
published
in
the
journal
Nature
Medicine
,
widespread
use
of
masks
could
prevent
nearly
130,000
of
500,000
COVID-related
deaths
estimated
to
occur
by
March
2021.These
numbers
are
based
on
an
epidemiological
model
.
The
researchers
considered
,
state
by
state
,
the
number
of
people
susceptible
to
coronavirus
infection
,
how
many
get
exposed
,
how
many
then
become
infected
(
and
infectious
)
,
and
how
many
recover
.
They
then
modeled
various
scenarios
,
including
mask
wearing
,
assuming
that
social
distancing
mandates
would
go
into
effect
once
the
number
of
deaths
exceeded
8
per
1
million
people.Modeling
studies
are
based
on
assumptions
,
so
the
exact
numbers
are
less
important
than
the
comparisons
of
different
scenarios
.
In
this
study
,
a
scenario
in
which
95
%
of
people
always
wore
masks
in
public
resulted
in
many
fewer
deaths
compared
to
a
scenario
in
which
only
49
%
of
people
(
the
self-reported
national
average
of
mask
wearers
)
always
wore
masks
in
public.This
study
reinforces
the
message
that
we
can
help
prevent
COVID
deaths
by
wearing
masks.You
are
better
off
meeting
friends
and
family
outdoors
.
We
know
that
coronavirus
spreads
when
someone
breathes
in
virus
that
an
infected
person
emits
through
coughs
or
sneezes
,
or
when
they
talk
or
breathe
.
Research
has
shown
that
in
a
confined
,
laboratory
setting
,
droplets
containing
viral
particles
can
remain
afloat
for
eight
to
14
minutes
.
Smaller
infectious
viral
particles
,
called
aerosols
,
can
drift
around
in
the
air
even
longer.Outdoors
,
air
currents
are
more
likely
to
scatter
and
dilute
the
virus
,
making
transmission
less
likely
than
in
a
home
,
office
,
or
other
confined
space
with
limited
air
circulation
.
Even
outdoors
,
if
you
are
not
fully
vaccinated
,
follow
CDC
guidance
on
masking
and
physical
distancing
,
to
reduce
risk
even
further.We
do
n't
know
for
certain
if
the
COVID-19
virus
spreads
through
air
conditioning
.
But
we
do
know
that
when
it
's
hot
and
humid
,
people
are
more
likely
to
stay
indoors
,
with
the
windows
closed
—
giving
the
virus
more
opportunity
to
spread.Coronavirus
spreads
through
droplets
that
an
infected
person
emits
through
coughs
or
sneezes
and
through
smaller
,
infectious
viral
particles
that
can
drift
around
in
the
air
for
several
hours
.
Outdoors
,
air
currents
can
scatter
and
dilute
the
virus
,
making
transmission
less
likely
.
You
're
more
likely
to
inhale
the
virus
indoors
,
with
the
windows
closed
,
whether
or
not
you
have
the
air
conditioning
on.If
you
must
be
indoors
with
anyone
outside
of
your
household
,
increase
air
circulation
by
keeping
the
windows
open
as
much
as
possible.There
is
some
evidence
to
suggest
that
vitamin
D
might
help
protect
against
becoming
infected
with
,
and
developing
serious
symptoms
of
,
COVID-19
.
We
know
,
for
example
,
that
people
with
low
vitamin
D
levels
may
be
more
susceptible
to
upper
respiratory
tract
infections
.
One
meta-analysis
found
that
people
who
took
vitamin
D
supplements
,
particularly
those
who
had
low
vitamin
D
levels
,
were
less
likely
to
develop
acute
respiratory
tract
infections
than
those
who
didn't.Vitamin
D
may
protect
against
COVID-19
in
two
ways
.
First
,
it
may
help
boost
our
bodies
'
natural
defense
against
viruses
and
bacteria
.
Second
,
it
may
help
prevent
an
exaggerated
inflammatory
response
,
which
has
been
shown
to
contribute
to
severe
illness
in
some
people
with
COVID-19.Our
bodies
make
vitamin
D
when
exposed
to
sunshine
.
Five
to
10
minutes
of
sun
exposure
on
some
or
most
days
of
the
week
to
the
arms
,
legs
,
or
back
without
sunscreen
will
enable
you
to
make
enough
of
the
vitamin
.
Good
food
sources
of
vitamin
D
include
fatty
fish
(
such
as
tuna
,
mackerel
,
and
salmon
)
,
foods
fortified
with
vitamin
D
(
such
as
dairy
products
,
soy
milk
,
and
cereals
)
,
cheese
,
and
egg
yolks.The
recommended
dietary
dose
of
vitamin
D
is
600
IU
each
day
for
adults
70
and
younger
and
800
IU
each
day
for
adults
over
70
.
A
daily
supplement
containing
1,000
to
2,000
IU
of
vitamin
D
is
likely
safe
for
most
people
.
For
adults
,
the
risk
of
harmful
effects
increases
above
4,000
IU
per
day.Guidance
from
the
CDC
issued
in
April
2021
states
that
fully
vaccinated
people
may
travel
more
freely
within
the
US
.
Travelers
do
not
need
to
get
COVID
testing
before
or
after
travel
and
do
not
need
to
quarantine
,
unless
required
by
local
or
state
authorities.The
CDC
is
more
cautious
about
international
travel
,
noting
the
increased
risk
of
variants
in
other
countries
,
even
for
people
who
are
fully
vaccinated.As
a
general
rule
,
travel
can
increase
your
chance
of
spreading
and
getting
COVID-19
if
you
are
not
vaccinated
.
The
CDC
recommends
that
unvaccinated
travels
get
tested
before
and
after
domestic
travel
and
self-quarantine
for
7
to
10
days
after
travel
.
They
discourage
unvaccinated
people
from
travelling
outside
of
the
US.All
travelers
should
wear
a
mask
that
covers
the
nose
and
mouth
,
maintain
a
physical
distance
of
six
feet
from
others
,
avoid
crowds
,
and
wash
hands
often
.
Anyone
who
is
sick
or
has
tested
positive
for
COVID-19
should
not
fly
if
at
all
possible.Stay
current
on
travel
advisories
from
regulatory
agencies.On
December
11
,
2020
,
the
FDA
granted
emergency
use
authorization
(
EUA
)
to
an
mRNA
COVID-19
vaccine
developed
by
Pfizer
and
BioNTech
.
This
was
the
first
COVID-19
vaccine
authorized
for
use
in
the
US
.
One
week
later
,
the
FDA
granted
EUA
to
an
mRNA
COVID-19
vaccine
developed
by
Moderna.Early
evidence
suggests
that
the
Pfizer/BioNTech
mRNA
vaccine
is
effective
against
the
new
coronavirus
variants
.
Testing
of
the
Moderna
mRNA
vaccine
against
the
new
variants
is
underway.The
two
new
variants
are
more
contagious
than
previous
SARS-CoV-2
variants
,
but
they
do
not
appear
to
be
deadlier
.
One
,
called
B.1.1.7
,
was
first
detected
in
the
United
Kingdom
.
The
other
,
called
B.1.351
,
originated
in
South
Africa
.
Both
variants
have
now
been
detected
in
countries
around
the
globe.Both
variants
contain
mutations
on
the
virus
's
spike
protein
.
Spike
proteins
on
the
surface
of
the
SARS-CoV-2
virus
bind
to
and
allow
the
virus
to
enter
human
cells
.
Interestingly
,
both
variants
share
a
key
mutation
(
called
N501Y
)
on
the
spike
protein
,
which
allows
the
virus
to
bind
more
tightly
to
human
cells
.
This
mutation
makes
the
new
variants
more
contagious
than
previous
SARS-CoV-2
variants.To
test
the
effectiveness
of
the
Pfizer/BioNTech
mRNA
vaccine
against
the
new
variants
,
researchers
created
a
virus
with
the
N501Y
mutation
.
They
then
took
blood
samples
from
20
participants
enrolled
in
their
vaccine
trial
and
exposed
it
to
the
mutated
virus
.
The
participants
’
blood
contained
human
cells
as
well
as
antibodies
made
in
response
to
the
Pfizer/BioNTech
vaccine
.
They
found
that
the
antibodies
blocked
the
mutated
virus
from
infecting
human
cells
as
effectively
as
it
blocked
the
virus
without
the
mutation.More
study
is
needed
to
see
if
these
results
hold
up
in
real
world
conditions
.
It
’
s
also
not
known
how
long
this
protection
may
last
,
and
whether
the
vaccines
will
work
against
other
mutations
found
in
these
variants.On
December
18
,
2020
,
the
FDA
granted

authorization
(

to
an
mRNA
COVID-19

developed
by
Moderna
in
collaboration
with
scientists
from
the
NIH
.
The
vaccine
is
approved
for
use
in

18
years
and
older
.
This
is
the
second
COVID-19
vaccine
authorized
for
use
in
the
US
.
(
The
Pfizer/BioNTech
vaccine
received
EUA
during
the
prior
week
.
)
The
FDA
granted
EUA
based
on
their

data
as
well
as
on
the
recommendation
made
by
the

briefing
documents
submitted
to
the
FDA
,
the
Moderna
vaccine
showed
an
overall
efficacy
of
94.1
%
in
preventing
COVID-19
.
This
study
enrolled
30,400
adults
;
half
received
the
vaccine
,
half
received
a
saltwater
placebo
shot
.
There
were
196
infections
among
the
study
participants
.
Of
these
,
185
were
in
the
placebo
group
and
11
were
in
the
vaccine
group
.
All
30
cases
of
severe
COVID
occurred
in
the
placebo
group
,
strongly
suggesting
indicating
that
the
vaccine
reduces
risk
of
severe
illness.The
vaccine
was
similarly
effective
in
people
older
and
younger
than
65
,
in
men
and
women
,
in
people
with
and
without
medical
conditions
that
put
them
at
high
risk
for
severe
illness
,
and
in
different
racial
and
ethnic
groups.The
most
common
vaccine
side
effects
were
pain
at
the
injection
site
,
fatigue
,
headache
,
muscle
pain
,
joint
pain
,
and
chills.This
vaccine
requires
two
doses
,
spaced
four
weeks
apart
.
We
do
not
yet
know
how
long

will
last.The
Moderna
vaccine
contains
synthetic

enters
human

and
instructs
them
to
produce
the
spike
protein
found
on
the
surface
of
the
SARS-CoV-2
virus
.
The
body
recognizes
the
spike
protein
as
an
invader
and
produces
antibodies
against
it
.
Soon
after
,
the
cell
breaks
down
the
mRNA
into
harmless
pieces
.
If
the
antibodies
later
encounter
the
actual
virus
,
they
are
ready
to
recognize
and
destroy
it
before
it
causes
illness.Unlike
the
Pfizer
vaccine
,
which
requires
ultracold
storage
,
the
Moderna
vaccine
can
be
stored
at
normal
freezer
temperatures
.
This
may
allow
for
wider
distribution
to
pharmacies
and
other
facilities
that
are
not
equipped

from
the
Pfizer/BioNTech
vaccine
trial
were
published
in
the
New
England
Journal
of
Medicine
.
The
data
showed
that
the
vaccine
reduced
the
risk
of
COVID-19
by
95
%
.
The
trial
enrolled
nearly
44,000
adults
,
each
of
whom
got
two
shots
,
spaced
three
weeks
apart
;
half
received
the
vaccine
and
half
got
a
placebo
(
a
shot
of
saltwater
)
.
Of
the
170
cases
of
COVID-19
that
developed
in
the
study
participants
,
162
were
in
the
placebo
group
and
eight
were
in
the
vaccine
group
.
Nine
of
the
10
severe
COVID
cases
occurred
in
the
placebo
group
,
suggesting
that
the
vaccine
reduced
risk
of
both
mild
and
severe
COVID.According
to
the
NEJM
article
,
the
vaccine
was
similarly
effective
in
study
participants
of
different
races
and
ethnicities
,
body
weight
categories
,
presence
or
absence
of
coexisting
medical
conditions
,
and
ages
(
younger
and
older
than
65
)
.
It
's
worth
noting
that
the
FDA
felt
comfortable
authorizing
the
vaccine
for
16-
and
17-year-olds
,
even
though
the
number
of
teens
enrolled
in
the
study
was
small.None
of
the
study
participants
experienced
serious
side
effects
.
However
,
most
did
have
pain
at
the
injection
site
.
Also
,
about
half
of
those
receiving
the
vaccine
reported
mild
to
moderate
fatigue
or
headache
or
both
.
Chills
and
fever
were
also
fairly
common
.
Symptoms
almost
always
resolved
within
24
to
48
hours.This
vaccine
requires
two
doses
,
spaced
three
weeks
apart
.
Although
the
vaccine
appears
to
provide
reasonable
protection
after
the
first
dose
,
it
provides
stronger
protection
after
two
doses
.
We
do
not
yet
know
how
long
immunity
from
this
vaccine
will
last.The
Pfizer/BioNTech
vaccine
is
an
mRNA
vaccine
.
The
vaccine
contains
synthetic
messenger
RNA
(
mRNA
)
,
genetic
material
that
contains
instructions
for
making
proteins
.
Inside
the
body
,
the
mRNA
enters
human
cells
and
instructs
them
to
produce
a
single
component
of
the
SARS-CoV-2
virus
—
the
``
spike
''
protein
found
on
the
virus
's
surface
.
The
body
recognizes
the
spike
protein
as
an
invader
and
produces
antibodies
against
it
.
If
the
antibodies
later
encounter
the
actual
virus
,
they
are
ready
to
recognize
and
destroy
it
before
it
causes
illness
.
mRNA
vaccines
must
be
stored
at
very
cold
temperatures
;
improperly
stored
vaccines
can
become
inactive.Healthcare
workers
and
residents
and
staff
of
long-term
care
facilities
will
be
the
first
to
get
the
vaccine.Even
people
who
have
already
gotten
sick
with
COVID-19
may
benefit
from
the
vaccine
,
according
to
the
CDC.Here
's
what
we
know
.
COVID-19
can
lead
to
serious
illness
and
long-term
complications
,
even
in
younger
people
and
those
without
underlying
medical
conditions
.
We
also
know
that
it
's
possible
for
someone
who
has
already
had
COVID-19
to
be
re-infected
,
though
this
is
not
common.On
the
other
hand
,
we
do
n't
know
how
long
natural
immunity
to
COVID-19
—
the
protection
that
results
from
having
been
sick
—
lasts
.
It
's
not
clear
if
the
strength
or
duration
of
natural
immunity
varies
based
on
the
severity
of
the
initial
illness
.
We
also
do
n't
know
how
long
immunity
conferred
by
vaccines
lasts.During
the
initial
deployment
of
the
vaccine
to
front
line
workers
and
people
in
long-term
care
facilities
like
nursing
homes
,
people
eligible
for
the
vaccine
will
get
it
regardless
of
whether
or
not
they
were
previously
infected
.
They
are
not
being
tested
for
antibodies
prior
to
vaccination.As
scientists
learn
more
about
natural
immunity
after
COVID
illness
,
vaccination
criteria
based
on
the
presence
of
antibodies
may
play
a
role
in
the
future.The
answer
is
,
we
do
n't
know.Clinical
trials
of
the
Pfizer/BioNTech
and
Moderna
vaccines
found
that
both
do
a
good
job
preventing
symptomatic
COVID-19
disease
,
including
severe
COVID-19
.
However
,
the
trials
did
not
measure
whether
a
person
who
is
vaccinated
is
less
likely
to
spread
the
virus
to
someone
else.It
's
possible
that
the
vaccines
protect
against
COVID-19
disease
by
preventing
a
person
from
becoming
infected
in
the
first
place
.
However
,
it
's
also
possible
that
the
vaccine
protects
a
person
from
COVID-19
illness
,
but
does
not
prevent
a
person
from
becoming
infected
.
In
other
words
,
a
vaccinated
person
may
have
replicating
virus
in
their
nose
and
throat
even
if
they
are
protected
from
becoming
sick.But
does
that
mean
that
you
have
enough
virus
in
your
nose
and
throat
to
infect
someone
else
?
Not
necessarily
.
It
's
possible
that
the
immune
response
triggered
by
the
vaccine
,
which
protects
you
from
becoming
sick
,
also
reduces
the
amount
of
virus
in
your
nose
and
throat
to
a
point
where
you
are
unlikely
to
spread
it
to
someone
else
.
But
we
need
more
research
to
know
for
sure.The
bottom
line
?
If
you
're
among
the
first
groups
of
people
to
get
vaccinated
,
it
's
best
to
continue
wearing
masks
and
maintaining
physical
distance
in
order
to
protect
others
who
have
n't
yet
gotten
the
vaccine.The
vaccine
will
protect
you
from
getting
sick
,
but
it
may
not
prevent
you
from
infecting
others
.
That
's
why
,
at
least
for
now
,
you
should
continue
wearing
a
mask
and
physically
distancing
from
others
,
even
after
you
get
your
shot.Clinical
trials
of
the
Pfizer/BioNTech
and
Moderna
vaccines
found
that
both
do
a
good
job
preventing
symptomatic
COVID-19
disease
,
including
severe
COVID-19
.
However
,
the
trials
did
not
measure
whether
a
person
who
is
vaccinated
is
less
likely
to
spread
the
virus
to
someone
else.It
's
possible
that
the
vaccines
protect
against
COVID-19
disease
by
preventing
a
person
from
becoming
infected
.
However
,
it
's
also
possible
that
the
vaccine
protects
a
person
from
getting
sick
but
does
not
prevent
the
virus
from
replicating
in
that
person
's
nose
and
throat.Does
that
mean
there
's
enough
virus
in
your
nose
and
throat
to
infect
someone
else
?
Not
necessarily
.
But
we
need
more
research
to
know
for
sure.Where
does
that
leave
us
?
If
you
're
among
the
first
groups
of
people
to
get
vaccinated
,
it
's
best
to
continue
wearing
masks
and
maintaining
physical
distance
in
order
to
protect
others
who
have
n't
yet
gotten
the
vaccine.A
successful
COVID-19
vaccine
had
to
safely
and
effectively
stimulate
the
body
's
immune
system
to
create
antibodies
that
protect
against
the
COVID-19
coronavirus
.
On
December
11
,
2020
,
the
FDA
granted
emergency
use
authorization
(
EUA
)
to
an
mRNA
COVID-19
vaccine
developed
by
Pfizer
and
BioNTech
.
One
week
later
,
the
FDA
granted
EUA
to
another
mRNA
COVID-19
vaccine
,
this
one
developed
by
Moderna
.
At
least
two
other
vaccine
candidates
are
close
behind
,
and
more
possible
COVID-19
vaccines
are
in
various
stages
of
development
and
testing.Approval
of
a
vaccine
requires
completion
of
the
following
steps
:
mRNA
,
or
messenger
RNA
,
is
genetic
material
that
contains
instructions
for
making

for
COVID-19
contain

.
Inside

,
the
mRNA
enters
human

and
instructs
them
to
produce
the
``

''
protein
found
on
the

that
causes
COVID-19
.
The
body
recognizes
the
spike

,
and
starts
producing
antibodies
against
it
.
Soon

and
another
developed
by

,
were
granted
emergency
use
authorization
(
EUA
)
by
the
FDA
in
December
2020.An
mRNA
vaccine
—
the
first
COVID-19
vaccine
to
be
granted
emergency
use
authorization
(
EUA
)
by
the
FDA
—
can
not
change
your
DNA.mRNA
,
or
messenger
RNA
,
is
genetic
material
that
contains
instructions
for
making

.
mRNA
vaccines
for
COVID-19
contain
man-made
mRNA
.
Inside
the
body
,
the
mRNA
enters
human
cells
and
instructs
them
to
produce
the
``
spike
''
protein
found
on
the
surface
of
the
COVID-19
virus
.
Soon
after
a
cell
makes
the
spike
protein
,
the
cell
breaks
down
the
mRNA
into
harmless
pieces
.
At
no
point
does
the
mRNA
enter
the
cell
's
nucleus
,
which
is
where
our
genetic
material
(
DNA
)
lives.The
immune
system
recognizes
the
spike
protein
as
an
invader
and
produces
antibodies
against
it
.
If
the
antibodies
later
encounter
the
actual
virus
,
they
are
ready
to
recognize
and
destroy
it
before
it
causes
illness.The
CDC
,
American
College
of
Obstetrics
and
Gynecology
(
ACOG
)
,
and
Society
for
Maternal-Fetal
Medicine
agree
that
the
new
mRNA
COVID-19
vaccines
(
Pfizer/BioNTech
and
Moderna
)
should
be
offered
to
pregnant
and
breastfeeding
individuals
.
But
there
is
a
lot
we
still
do
not
know
about
the
safety
of
the
vaccines
in
these
populations
,
and
your
own
doctor
is
in
the
best
to
position
to
advise
you
based
on
your
personal
health
risks
and
preferences.Here
are
some
factors
to
consider
.
First
,
although
the
actual
risk
of
severe
COVID-19
illness
and
death
among
pregnant
individuals
is
very
low
,
it
is
higher
when
compared
to
nonpregnant
individuals
from
the
same
age
group
.
In
addition
,
research
suggests
that
having
COVID-19
might
increase
risk
for
premature
birth
,
particularly
for
those
with
severe
illness
.
Transmission
of
the
virus
from
mother
to
baby
during
pregnancy
is
possible
,
but
it
appears
to
be
a
rare
event.mRNA
vaccine
trials
did
not
deliberately
include
pregnant
individuals
,
so
our
knowledge
regarding
the
safety
of
mRNA
COVID-19
vaccines
during
pregnancy
is
limited
.
In
animal
studies
,
mRNA
vaccines
did
not
affect
fertility
or
cause
any
problems
with
pregnancy
.
mRNA
vaccines
do
not
contain
any
virus
,
so
they
can
not
cause
COVID-19
in
a
woman
or
her
baby
.
And
our
bodies
quickly
break
down
and
eliminate
mRNA
particles
used
in
the
vaccine
so
they
are
unlikely
to
reach
or
cross
the
placenta
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
immunity
that
a
woman
generates
from
vaccination
can
cross
the
placenta
,
and
may
help
to
keep
the
baby
safe
after
birth.Experts
also
believe
it
is
most
likely
safe
to
get
an
mRNA
COVID-19
vaccine
if
you
’
re
breastfeeding
,
although
breastfeeding
people
were
not
included
in
the
vaccine
trials
.
When
a
person
gets
vaccinated
while
breastfeeding
,
their
immune
system
develops
antibodies
that
protect
against
COVID-19
.
These
antibodies
can
be
passed
through
breast
milk
to
the
baby
and
are
likely
to
help
protect
against
infection.Adenoviruses
can
cause
a
variety
of
illnesses
,
including
the
common
cold
.
They
are
being
used
in
two
leading
COVID-19
vaccine
candidates
as
capsules
(
the
scientific
term
is
vectors
)
to
deliver
the
coronavirus
spike
protein
into
the
body
.
The
spike
protein
prompts
the
immune
system
to
produce
antibodies
against
it
,
preparing
the
body
to
attack
the
SARS-CoV-2
virus
if
it
later
infects
the
body.In
December
2020
,
AstraZeneca
published
promising
results
of
an
adenovirus-based
vaccine
that
it
developed
with
researchers
at
the
University
of
Oxford
.
The
study
was
published
in
the
journal
The
Lancet.The
Lancet
analysis
of
vaccine
efficacy
was
based
on
11,636
adult
study
participants
.
Of
these
,
4,440
participants
received
a
full
dose
of
the
coronavirus
vaccine
,
followed
four
weeks
later
by
another
full
dose
.
Nearly
1,400
participants
received
a
half
dose
of
the
coronavirus
vaccine
,
followed
four
weeks
later
by
a
full
dose
.
The
control
group
received
a
meningitis
vaccine
,
followed
by
a
second
meningitis
vaccine
or
a
placebo
(
a
salt
water
shot
)
.
There
were
131
documented
cases
of
COVID-19
,
all
of
which
occurred
at
least
two
weeks
after
the
second
shot.The
coronavirus
vaccine
reduced
the
risk
of
COVID-19
by
an
average
of
70.4
%
,
compared
to
the
control
group
.
Surprisingly
,
the
half
dose/full
dose
vaccine
combination
was
more
effective
,
reducing
risk
of
COVID-19
by
90
%
.
The
full
dose
combination
reduced
risk
by
62
%
.
None
of
the
participants
who
received
the
coronavirus
vaccine
developed
severe
COVID-19
or
had
to
be
hospitalized
.
There
was
also
a
reduction
in
asymptomatic
cases.Most
study
participants
were
between
the
ages
of
18
and
55
,
and
white
.
In
addition
,
the
study
participants
were
healthy
or
had
stable
underlying
medical
conditions
.
More
data
is
needed
to
understand
how
effective
this
vaccine
is
in
people
older
than
55
,
people
of
color
,
and
people
with
underlying
medical
conditions
.
This
vaccine
is
in
clinical
trials
around
the
world
,
including
the
US
.
But
this
analysis
was
based
on
data
from
the
United
Kingdom
and
Brazil.The
adenovirus
used
in
the
AstraZeneca/University
of
Oxford
vaccine
is
a
weakened
,
harmless
form
of
a
chimpanzee
common-cold
adenovirus
.
This
vaccine
can
be
safely
refrigerated
for
several
months.In
mid-December
,
healthcare
workers
and
residents
and
staff
of
long-term
care
facilities
became
the
first
group
in
the
US
to
start
getting
the
COVID-19
vaccine
.
The
CDC
has
recommended
that
adults
age
75
years
and
older
and
frontline
essential
workers
be
vaccinated
next
.
They
will
be
followed
by
adults
aged
65
to
74
,
people
aged
16
to
64
with
medical
conditions
that
put
them
at
high
risk
for
severe
COVID-19
,
and
remaining
essential
workers.State
and
local
authorities
are
not
obligated
to
follow
the
CDC
's
recommendations
;
they
may
reprioritize
the
order
in
which
they
distribute
the
vaccines
at
their
discretion.There
are
about
21
million
healthcare
workers
in
the
US
,
doing
a
variety
of
jobs
in
hospitals
and
outpatient
clinics
,
pharmacies
,
emergency
medical
services
,
and
public
health
.
Another
three
million
people
reside
or
work
in
long-term
care
facilities
,
which
include
nursing
homes
,
assisted-living
facilities
,
and
residential
care
facilities
.
COVID-19
has
taken
a
heavy
toll
on
residents
of
long-term
care
facilities
.
Frontline
essential
workers
are
those
who
can
not
work
from
home
and
who
may
not
be
able
to
physically
distance
while
working
.
They
include
first
responders
such
as
firefighters
and
police
,
teachers
and
day
care
workers
,
postal
workers
,
and
people
who
work
in
grocery
stores.The
CDC
's
guidance
is
based
on
a
recommendation
from
the
Advisory
Committee
on
Immunization
Practices
(
ACIP
)
,
made
up
of
experts
in
vaccinology
,
immunology
,
virology
,
public
health
,
and
other
related
fields
.
Their
work
is
not
limited
to
the
COVID-19
vaccine
;
they
broadly
advise
the
CDC
on
vaccinations
and
immunization
schedules.Around
the
world
,
there
are
currently
over
70
different
COVID-19
vaccines
in
various
stages
of
testing
and
development
:
phase
1
(
safety
)
,
phase
2
(
optimal
dose
,
schedule
,
and
proof
of
concept
)
,
and
phase
3
(
effectiveness
,
side
effects
)
trials
in
humans.In
December
2020
,
the
FDA
granted
emergency
use
authorization
(
EUA
)
to
two
COVID-19
vaccines
,
one
developed
by
Pfizer/BioNTech
and
another
developed
by
Moderna
.
These
vaccines
use
a
type
of
molecule
called
messenger
RNA
(
mRNA
)
that
can
be
mass-manufactured
very
rapidly
.
In
these
vaccines
,
mRNA
induces
human
cells
to
make
a
protein
that
looks
just
like
the
spike
protein
that
studs
the
surface
of
the
coronavirus
and
enables
it
to
enter
human
cells
.
The
body
recognizes
the
spike
protein
as
an
invader
,
and
produces
antibodies
against
it
.
If
the
antibodies
later
encounter
the
actual
virus
,
they
are
ready
to
recognize
and
destroy
it
before
it
causes
illness.Two
other
vaccine
approaches
are
also
showing
promise.A
central
question
for
COVID-19
vaccines
will
be
how
long
protection
might
last.Natural
immunity
to
COVID-19
is
the
protection
that
results
from
having
been
sick
.
But
we
do
n't
know
how
long
natural
immunity
lasts
,
or
how
strong
it
is
.
So
can
we
count
on
natural
immunity
to
protect
us
from
reinfection
?
If
so
,
for
how
long
?
Unfortunately
,
we
do
n't
know
the
answer
to
either
of
those
questions.There
have
been
some
confirmed
cases
of
reinfection
with
COVID-19
.
In
other
words
,
a
person
got
sick
with
COVID-19
,
recovered
,
and
then
became
infected
again
.
This
is
rare
,
but
it
can
happen.Evidence
suggests
that
people
who
have
already
gotten
sick
with
COVID-19
benefit
from
the
vaccine
,
possibly
even
more
than
vaccinated
people
who
were
not
previously
infected
.
For
now
,
people
are
eligible
to
get
the
COVID-19
vaccine
whether
or
not
they
were
previously
infected
.
Vaccination
criteria
may
change
in
the
future
as
scientists
learn
more
about
natural
immunity
after
COVID
illness.Herd
immunity
occurs
when
enough
people
become
immune
to
a
disease
to
make
its
spread
unlikely
.
As
a
result
,
the
entire
community
is
protected
,
even
those
who
are
not
themselves
immune
.
Herd
immunity
is
usually
achieved
through
vaccination
,
but
it
can
also
occur
through
natural
infection.Experts
initially
estimated
that
somewhere
between
60
%
and
70
%
of
the
population
needs
to
be
immune
in
order
to
achieve
herd
immunity
.
More
recently
,
they
have
raised
that
estimate
to
near
90
%
.
(
As
of
now
,
we
are
nowhere
close
to
the
numbers
needed
to
achieve
herd
immunity
.
)
Achieving
herd
immunity
through
natural
infection
means
many
people
would
become
ill
and
many
would
die
.
These
risks
may
fall
as
we
develop
effective
treatments
.
However
,
we
still
do
n't
know
how
long
people
who
recover
from
COVID-19
will
remain
immune
to
reinfection.Ideally
,
we
will
achieve
herd
immunity
as
more
people
around
the
world
receive
vaccines
that
will
confer
lasting
immunity.Vaccines
against
pneumonia
,
such
as
pneumococcal
vaccine
and
Hemophilus
influenza
type
B
(
Hib
)
vaccine
,
only
help
protect
people
from
these
specific
bacterial
infections
.
They
do
not
protect
against
any
coronavirus
pneumonia
,
including
pneumonia
that
may
be
part
of
COVID-19
.
However
,
even
though
these
vaccines
do
not
specifically
protect
against
the
coronavirus
that
causes
COVID-19
,
they
are
highly
recommended
to
protect
against
other
respiratory
illnesses.At
present
,
it
is
considered
unlikely
that
pets
such
as
dogs
or
cats
can
spread
the
COVID-19
virus
to
humans
.
However
,
pets
can
spread
other
infections
that
cause
illness
,
including
E.
coli
and
Salmonella
,
so
wash
your
hands
thoroughly
with
soap
and
water
after
interacting
with
pets.The
virus
that
causes
COVID-19
does
appear
to
spread
from
people
to
pets
,
according
to
the
FDA
.
Research
has
found
that
cats
and
ferrets
are
more
likely
to
become
infected
than
dogs.If
you
have
a
pet
,
do
the
following
to
reduce
their
risk
of
infection
:
If
you
become
sick
with
COVID-19
,
restrict
contact
with
your
pets
,
just
like
you
would
around
other
people
.
This
means
you
should
forgo
petting
,
snuggling
,
being
kissed
or
licked
,
and
sharing
food
or
bedding
with
your
pet
until
you
are
feeling
better
.
When
possible
,
have
another
member
of
your
household
care
for
your
pets
while
you
are
sick
.
If
you
must
care
for
your
pet
while
you
are
sick
,
wash
your
hands
before
and
after
you
interact
with
your
pets
and
wear
a
face
mask.Your
immune
system
is
your
body
's
defense
system
.
When
a
harmful
invader
—
like
a
cold
or
flu
virus
,
or
the
coronavirus
that
causes
COVID-19
—
gets
into
your
body
,
your
immune
system
mounts
an
attack
.
Known
as
an
immune
response
,
this
attack
is
a
sequence
of
events
that
involves
various
cells
and
unfolds
over
time.Following
general
health
guidelines
is
the
best
step
you
can
take
toward
keeping
your
immune
system
strong
and
healthy
.
Every
part
of
your
body
,
including
your
immune
system
,
functions
better
when
protected
from
environmental
assaults
and
bolstered
by
healthy-living
strategies
such
as
these
:
Many
medical
and
dental
practices
have
instituted
comprehensive
safety
measures
to
help
protect
you
,
the
doctor
and
office
staff
,
and
other
patients
.
If
you
feel
anxious
about
visiting
in
person
,
call
the
practice.Many
doctor
's
offices
are
increasingly
providing
telehealth
services
.
This
may
mean
appointments
by
phone
call
,
or
virtual
visits
using
a
video
chat
service
.
Ask
to
schedule
a
telehealth
appointment
with
your
doctor
for
a
new
or
ongoing
nonurgent
matter
.
If
,
after
speaking
to
you
,
your
doctor
would
like
to
see
you
in
person
,
he
or
she
will
let
you
know.What
if
your
appointments
are
not
urgent
but
also
do
n't
fall
into
the
low-risk
category
?
For
example
,
if
you
have
been
advised
to
have
periodic
scans
after
cancer
remission
,
if
your
doctor
sees
you
regularly
to
monitor
for
a
condition
for
which
you
're
at
increased
risk
,
or
if
your
treatment
varies
based
on
your
most
recent
test
results
?
In
these
and
similar
cases
,
call
your
doctor
for
advice.The
availability
of
elective
surgeries
and
procedures
throughout
the
United
States
is
very
fluid
,
and
may
reflect
the
number
of
cases
and
infection
rate
in
a
given
area
.
If
COVID-19
cases
are
rising
in
your
area
,
it
's
quite
possible
that
you
already
have
been
canceled
or
rescheduled
by
the
hospital
or
medical
center
in
which
you
are
scheduled
to
have
the
procedure
.
If
not
,
you
should
consider
postponing
any
procedure
that
can
wait.That
being
said
,
keep
in
mind
that
``
elective
''
is
a
relative
term
.
For
instance
,
you
may
not
have
needed
immediate
surgery
for
sciatica
caused
by
a
herniated
disc
.
But
the
pain
may
be
so
severe
that
you
would
not
be
able
to
endure
postponing
the
surgery
for
weeks
or
perhaps
months
.
In
that
case
,
you
and
your
doctor
should
make
a
shared
decision
about
proceeding
.
The
new
Covid-19
vaccines
from
Pfizer
and
Moderna
seem
to
be
remarkably
good
at
preventing
serious
illness
.
But
it
’
s
unclear
how
well
they
will
curb
the
spread
of
the
coronavirus.That
’
s
because
the
Pfizer
and
Moderna
trials
tracked
only
how
many
vaccinated
people
became
sick
with
Covid-19
.
That
leaves
open
the
possibility
that
some
vaccinated
people
get
infected
without
developing
symptoms
,
and
could
then
silently
transmit
the
virus
—
especially
if
they
come
in
close
contact
with
others
or
stop
wearing
masks.If
vaccinated
people
are
silent
spreaders
of
the
virus
,
they
may
keep
it
circulating
in
their
communities
,
putting
unvaccinated
people
at
risk.
“
A
lot
of
people
are
thinking
that
once
they
get
vaccinated
,
they
’
re
not
going
to
have
to
wear
masks
anymore
,
”
said
Michal
Tal
,
an
immunologist
at
Stanford
University
.
“
It
’
s
really
going
to
be
critical
for
them
to
know
if
they
have
to
keep
wearing
masks
,
because
they
could
still
be
contagious.
”
In
most
respiratory
infections
,
including
the
new
coronavirus
,
the
nose
is
the
main
port
of
entry
.
The
virus
rapidly
multiplies
there
,
jolting
the
immune
system
to
produce
a
type
of
antibodies
that
are
specific
to
mucosa
,
the
moist
tissue
lining
the
nose
,
mouth
,
lungs
and
stomach
.
If
the
same
person
is
exposed
to
the
virus
a
second
time
,
those
antibodies
,
as
well
as
immune
cells
that
remember
the
virus
,
rapidly
shut
down
the
virus
in
the
nose
before
it
gets
a
chance
to
take
hold
elsewhere
in
the
body.The
coronavirus
vaccines
,
in
contrast
,
are
injected
deep
into
the
muscles
and
stimulate
the
immune
system
to
produce
antibodies
.
This
appears
to
be
enough
protection
to
keep
the
vaccinated
person
from
getting
ill.Some
of
those
antibodies
will
circulate
in
the
blood
to
the
nasal
mucosa
and
stand
guard
there
,
but
it
’
s
not
clear
how
much
of
the
antibody
pool
can
be
mobilized
,
or
how
quickly
.
If
the
answer
is
not
much
,
then
viruses
could
bloom
in
the
nose
—
and
be
sneezed
or
breathed
out
to
infect
others.
“
It
’
s
a
race
:
It
depends
whether
the
virus
can
replicate
faster
,
or
the
immune
system
can
control
it
faster
,
”
said
Marion
Pepper
,
an
immunologist
at
the
University
of
Washington
in
Seattle
.
“
It
’
s
a
really
important
question.
”
This
is
why
mucosal
vaccines
,
like
the
nasal
spray
FluMist
or
the
oral
polio
vaccine
,
are
better
than
intramuscular
injections
at
fending
off
respiratory
viruses
,
experts
said.The
next
generation
of
coronavirus
vaccines
may
elicit
immunity
in
the
nose
and
the
rest
of
the
respiratory
tract
,
where
it
’
s
most
needed
.
Or
people
could
get
an
intramuscular
injection
followed
by
a
mucosal
boost
that
produces
protective
antibodies
in
the
nose
and
throat.The
coronavirus
vaccines
have
proved
to
be
powerful
shields
against
severe
illness
,
but
that
is
no
guarantee
of
their
efficacy
in
the
nose
.
The
lungs
—
the
site
of
severe
symptoms
—
are
much
more
accessible
to
the
circulating
antibodies
than
the
nose
or
throat
,
making
them
easier
to
safeguard.

Preventing
severe
disease
is
easiest
,
preventing
mild
disease
is
harder
,
and
preventing
all
infections
is
the
hardest
,
”
said
Deepta
Bhattacharya
,
an
immunologist
at
the
University
of
Arizona
.
“
If
it
’
s
95
percent
effective
at
preventing
symptomatic
disease
,
it
’
s
going
to
be
something
less
than
that
in
preventing
all
infections
,
for
sure.
”
Still
,
he
and
other
experts
said
they
were
optimistic
that
the
vaccines
would
suppress
the
virus
enough
even
in
the
nose
and
throat
to
prevent
immunized
people
from
spreading
it
to
others.
“
My
feeling
is
that
once
you
develop
some
form
of
immunity
with
the
vaccine
,
your
ability
to
get
infected
will
also
go
down
,
”
said
Akiko
Iwasaki
,
an
immunologist
at
Yale
University
.
“
Even
if
you
’
re
infected
,
the
level
of
virus
that
you
replicate
in
your
nose
should
be
reduced.
”
The
vaccine
trials
have
not
produced
data
on
how
many
vaccinated
people
were
infected
with
the
virus
but
did
not
have
symptoms
.
Some
hints
are
emerging
,
however.AstraZeneca
,
which
announced
some
of
its
trial
results
in
November
,
said
that
volunteers
had
been
testing
themselves
regularly
for
the
virus
,
and
that
those
results
suggested
that
the
vaccine
might
prevent
some
infections.Pfizer
will
test
a
subset
of
its
trial
participants
for
antibodies
against
a
viral
protein
called
N.
Because
the
vaccines
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
protein
,
N
antibodies
would
reveal
whether
the
volunteers
had
become
infected
with
the
virus
after
immunization
,
said
Jerica
Pitts
,
a
spokeswoman
for
the
company.Moderna
also
plans
to
analyze
blood
from
all
its
participants
and
test
for
N
antibodies
.
“
It
will
take
several
weeks
before
we
can
expect
to
see
those
results
,
”
said
Colleen
Hussey
,
a
spokeswoman
for
Moderna.The
trials
have
so
far
analyzed
only
blood
,
but
testing
for
antibodies
in
mucosa
would
confirm
that
the
antibodies
can
travel
to
the
nose
and
mouth
.
Dr.
Tal
’
s
team
is
planning
to
analyze
matched
blood
and
saliva
samples
from
volunteers
in
the
Johnson
&
Johnson
trial
to
see
how
the
two
antibody
levels
compare.In
the
meantime
,
Dr.
Bhattacharya
said
,
he
was
encouraged
by
recent
work
showing
that
people
who
received
an
intramuscular
flu
vaccine
had
abundant
antibodies
in
the
nose
.
And
a
study
of
Covid-19
patients
found
that
antibody
levels
in
saliva
and
blood
were
closely
matched
—
suggesting
that
a
strong
immune
response
in
the
blood
would
also
protect
mucosal
tissues.Only
people
who
have
virus
teeming
in
their
nose
and
throat
would
be
expected
to
transmit
the
virus
,
and
the
lack
of
symptoms
in
the
immunized
people
who
became
infected
suggests
that
the
vaccine
may
have
kept
the
virus
levels
in
check.But
some
studies
have
suggested
that
even
people
with
no
symptoms
can
have
high
amounts
of
coronavirus
in
their
nose
,
noted
Dr.
Yvonne
Maldonado
,
who
represents
the
American
Academy
of
Pediatrics
at
meetings
of
the
federal
Advisory
Committee
on
Immunization
Practices
.
The
first
person
confirmed
to
be
reinfected
with
the
coronavirus
,
a
33-year-old
man
in
Hong
Kong
,
also
did
not
have
symptoms
,
but
harbored
enough
virus
to
infect
others.Vaccinated
people
who
have
a
high
viral
load
but
don
’
t
have
symptoms
“
would
actually
be
,
in
some
ways
,
even
worse
spreaders
because
they
may
be
under
a
false
sense
of
security
,
”
Dr.
Maldonado
said.Dr
.
Tal
said
she
was
concerned
by
monkey
studies
showing
that
some
vaccinated
animals
did
not
get
ill
,
but
still
had
virus
in
their
nose.But
those
monkeys
were
intentionally
exposed
to
massive
amounts
of
virus
and
still
had
less
virus
than
unvaccinated
animals
,
said
John
Moore
,
a
virologist
at
Weill
Cornell
Medicine
in
New
York.
“
The
more
you
reduce
viral
load
,
the
less
likely
you
are
to
be
transmissible
,
”
Dr.
Moore
said
.
But
“
all
of
these
are
things
where
data
trumps
theory
,
and
we
need
the
data.
”
At
what
point
does
a
country
achieve
herd
immunity
?
What
portion
of
the
population
must
acquire
resistance
to
the
coronavirus
,
either
through
infection
or
vaccination
,
in
order
for
the
disease
to
fade
away
and
life
to
return
to
normal
?
Since
the
start
of
the
pandemic
,
the
figure
that
many
epidemiologists
have
offered
has
been
60
to
70
percent
.
That
range
is
still
cited
by
the
World
Health
Organization
and
is
often
repeated
during
discussions
of
the
future
course
of
the
disease.Although
it
is
impossible
to
know
with
certainty
what
the
limit
will
be
until
we
reach
it
and
transmission
stops
,
having
a
good
estimate
is
important
:
It
gives
Americans
a
sense
of
when
we
can
hope
to
breathe
freely
again.Recently
,
a
figure
to
whom
millions
of
Americans
look
for
guidance
—
Dr.
Anthony
S.
Fauci
,
an
adviser
to
both
the
Trump
administration
and
the
incoming
Biden
administration
—
has
begun
incrementally
raising
his
herd-immunity
estimate.In
the
pandemic
’
s
early
days
,
Dr.
Fauci
tended
to
cite
the
same
60
to
70
percent
estimate
that
most
experts
did
.
About
a
month
ago
,
he
began
saying
“
70
,
75
percent
”
in
television
interviews
.
And
last
week
,
in
an
interview
with
CNBC
News
,
he
said
“
75
,
80
,
85
percent
”
and
“
75
to
80-plus
percent.
”
In
a
telephone
interview
the
next
day
,
Dr.
Fauci
acknowledged
that
he
had
slowly
but
deliberately
been
moving
the
goal
posts
.
He
is
doing
so
,
he
said
,
partly
based
on
new
science
,
and
partly
on
his
gut
feeling
that
the
country
is
finally
ready
to
hear
what
he
really
thinks.Hard
as
it
may
be
to
hear
,
he
said
,
he
believes
that
it
may
take
close
to
90
percent
immunity
to
bring
the
virus
to
a
halt
—
almost
as
much
as
is
needed
to
stop
a
measles
outbreak.Asked
about
Dr.
Fauci
’
s
conclusions
,
prominent
epidemiologists
said
that
he
might
be
proven
right
.
The
early
range
of
60
to
70
percent
was
almost
undoubtedly
too
low
,
they
said
,
and
the
virus
is
becoming
more
transmissible
,
so
it
will
take
greater
herd
immunity
to
stop
it.Dr
.
Fauci
said
that
weeks
ago
,
he
had
hesitated
to
publicly
raise
his
estimate
because
many
Americans
seemed
hesitant
about
vaccines
,
which
they
would
need
to
accept
almost
universally
in
order
for
the
country
to
achieve
herd
immunity.Now
that
some
polls
are
showing
that
many
more
Americans
are
ready
,
even
eager
,
for
vaccines
,
he
said
he
felt
he
could
deliver
the
tough
message
that
the
return
to
normal
might
take
longer
than
anticipated.
“
When
polls
said
only
about
half
of
all
Americans
would
take
a
vaccine
,
I
was
saying
herd
immunity
would
take
70
to
75
percent
,
”
Dr.
Fauci
said
.
“
Then
,
when
newer
surveys
said
60
percent
or
more
would
take
it
,
I
thought
,
‘
I
can
nudge
this
up
a
bit
,
’
so
I
went
to
80
,
85.
”
“
We
need
to
have
some
humility
here
,
”
he
added
.
“
We
really
don
’
t
know
what
the
real
number
is
.
I
think
the
real
range
is
somewhere
between
70
to
90
percent
.
But
,
I
’
m
not
going
to
say
90
percent.
”
Doing
so
might
be
discouraging
to
Americans
,
he
said
,
because
he
is
not
sure
there
will
be
enough
voluntary
acceptance
of
vaccines
to
reach
that
goal
.
Although
sentiments
about
vaccines
in
polls
have
bounced
up
and
down
this
year
,
several
current
ones
suggest
that
about
20
percent
of
Americans
say
they
are
unwilling
to
accept
any
vaccine.Also
,
Dr.
Fauci
noted
,
a
herd-immunity
figure
at
90
percent
or
above
is
in
the
range
of
the
infectiousness
of
measles.
“
I
’
d
bet
my
house
that
Covid
isn
’
t
as
contagious
as
measles
,
”
he
said.Measles
is
thought
to
be
the
world
’
s
most
contagious
disease
;
it
can
linger
in
the
air
for
hours
or
drift
through
vents
to
infect
people
in
other
rooms
.
In
some
studies
of
outbreaks
in
crowded
military
barracks
and
student
dormitories
,
it
has
kept
transmitting
until
more
than
95
percent
of
all
residents
are
infected.Interviews
with
epidemiologists
regarding
the
degree
of
herd
immunity
needed
to
defeat
the
coronavirus
produced
a
range
of
estimates
,
some
of
which
were
in
line
with
Dr.
Fauci
’
s
.
They
also
came
with
a
warning
:
All
answers
are
merely
“
guesstimates.
”
“
You
tell
me
what
numbers
to
put
in
my
equations
,
and
I
’
ll
give
you
the
answer
,
”
said
Marc
Lipsitch
,
an
epidemiologist
at
Harvard
’
s
T.H
.
Chan
School
of
Public
Health
.
“
But
you
can
’
t
tell
me
the
numbers
,
because
nobody
knows
them.
”
The
only
truly
accurate
measures
of
herd
immunity
are
done
in
actual
herds
and
come
from
studying
animal
viruses
like
rinderpest
and
foot-and-mouth
disease
,
said
Dr.
David
M.
Morens
,
Dr.
Fauci
’
s
senior
adviser
on
epidemiology
at
the
National
Institute
of
Allergy
and
Infectious
Diseases.When
cattle
are
penned
in
corrals
,
it
is
easy
to
measure
how
fast
a
disease
spreads
from
one
animal
to
another
,
he
said
.
Humans
move
around
,
so
studying
disease
spread
among
them
is
far
harder.The
original
assumption
that
it
would
take
60
to
70
percent
immunity
to
stop
the
disease
was
based
on
early
data
from
China
and
Italy
,
health
experts
noted.Epidemiologists
watching
how
fast
cases
doubled
in
those
outbreaks
calculated
that
the
virus
’
s
reproduction
number
,
or
R0
—
how
many
new
victims
each
carrier
infected
—
was
about
3
.
So
two
out
of
three
potential
victims
would
have
to
become
immune
before
each
carrier
infected
fewer
than
one
.
When
each
carrier
infects
fewer
than
one
new
victim
,
the
outbreak
slowly
dies
out.Two
out
of
three
is
66.7
percent
,
which
established
the
range
of
60
to
70
percent
for
herd
immunity.Reinforcing
that
notion
was
a
study
conducted
by
the
French
military
on
the
crew
of
the
aircraft
carrier
Charles
de
Gaulle
,
which
had
an
outbreak
in
late
March
,
said
Dr.
Christopher
J.L
.
Murray
,
director
of
the
University
of
Washington
’
s
Institute
for
Health
Metrics
and
Evaluation.The
study
found
that
1,064
of
the
1,568
sailors
aboard
,
or
about
68
percent
,
had
tested
positive
for
the
virus.But
the
carrier
returned
to
port
while
the
outbreak
was
still
in
progress
,
and
the
crew
went
into
quarantine
,
so
it
was
unclear
whether
the
virus
was
finished
infecting
new
sailors
even
after
68
percent
had
caught
it.Also
,
outbreaks
aboard
ships
are
poor
models
for
those
on
land
because
infections
move
much
faster
in
the
close
quarters
of
a
vessel
than
in
a
free-roaming
civilian
population
,
said
Dr.
Natalie
E.
Dean
,
a
biostatistician
at
the
University
of
Florida.More
important
,
the
early
estimates
from
Wuhan
and
Italy
were
later
revised
upward
,
Dr.
Lipsitch
noted
,
once
Chinese
scientists
realized
they
had
undercounted
the
number
of
victims
of
the
first
wave
.
It
took
about
two
months
to
be
certain
that
there
were
many
asymptomatic
people
who
had
also
spread
the
virus.It
also
became
clearer
later
that
“
superspreader
events
,
”
in
which
one
person
infects
dozens
or
even
hundreds
of
others
,
played
a
large
role
in
spreading
Covid-19
.
Such
events
,
in
“
normal
”
populations
—
in
which
no
one
wears
masks
and
everyone
attends
events
like
parties
,
basketball
tournaments
or
Broadway
shows
—
can
push
the
reproduction
number
upward
to
4
,
5
or
even
6
,
experts
said
.
Consequently
,
those
scenarios
call
for
higher
herd
immunity
;
for
example
,
at
an
R0
of
5
,
more
than
four
out
of
five
people
,
or
80
percent
,
must
be
immune
to
slow
down
the
virus.Further
complicating
matters
,
there
is
a
growing
consensus
among
scientists
that
the
virus
itself
is
becoming
more
transmissible
.
A
variant
“
Italian
strain
”
with
the
mutation
known
as
D614G
has
spread
much
faster
than
the
original
Wuhan
variant
.
A
newly
identified
mutation
,
sometimes
called
N501Y
,
that
may
make
the
virus
even
more
infectious
has
recently
appeared
in
Britain
,
South
Africa
and
elsewhere.The
more
transmissible
a
pathogen
,
the
more
people
must
become
immune
in
order
to
stop
it.Dr
.
Morens
and
Dr.
Lipsitch
agreed
with
Dr.
Fauci
that
the
level
of
herd
immunity
needed
to
stop
Covid-19
could
be
85
percent
or
higher
.
“
But
that
’
s
a
guesstimate
,
”
Dr.
Lipsitch
emphasized.
“
Tony
’
s
reading
the
tea
leaves
,
”
Dr.
Morens
said.The
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
offers
no
herd
immunity
estimate
,
saying
on
its
website
that
“
experts
do
not
know.
”
Although
W.H.O
.
scientists
still
sometimes
cite
the
older
60
to
70
percent
estimate
,
Dr.
Katherine
O
’
Brien
,
the
agency
’
s
director
of
immunization
,
said
that
she
now
thought
that
range
was
too
low
.
She
declined
to
estimate
what
the
correct
higher
one
might
be.
“
We
’
d
be
leaning
against
very
thin
reeds
if
we
tried
to
say
what
level
of
vaccine
coverage
would
be
needed
to
achieve
it
,
”
she
said
.
“
We
should
say
we
just
don
’
t
know
.
And
it
won
’
t
be
a
world
or
even
national
number
.
It
will
depend
on
what
community
you
live
in.
”
Dr
.
Dean
noted
that
to
stop
transmission
in
a
crowded
city
like
New
York
,
more
people
would
have
to
achieve
immunity
than
would
be
necessary
in
a
less
crowded
place
like
Montana.Even
if
Dr.
Fauci
is
right
and
it
will
take
85
or
even
90
percent
herd
immunity
to
completely
stop
coronavirus
transmission
,
Dr.
Lipsitch
said
,
“
we
can
still
defang
the
virus
sooner
than
that.
”
He
added
:
“
We
don
’
t
have
to
have
zero
transmission
in
order
to
have
a
decent
society
.
We
have
lots
of
diseases
,
like
flu
,
transmitting
all
the
time
,
and
we
don
’
t
shut
down
society
for
that
.
If
we
can
vaccinate
almost
all
the
people
who
are
most
at
risk
of
severe
outcomes
,
then
this
would
become
a
milder
disease.

With
the
coronavirus
pandemic
surging
and
initial
vaccine
supplies
limited
,
the
United
States
faces
a
hard
choice
:
Should
the
country
’
s
immunization
program
focus
in
the
early
months
on
the
elderly
and
people
with
serious
medical
conditions
,
who
are
dying
of
the
virus
at
the
highest
rates
,
or
on
essential
workers
,
an
expansive
category
encompassing
Americans
who
have
borne
the
greatest
risk
of
infection
?
Health
care
workers
and
the
frailest
of
the
elderly
—
residents
of
long-term-care
facilities
—
will
almost
certainly
get
the
first
shots
,
under
guidelines
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
issued
on
Thursday
.
But
with
vaccination
expected
to
start
this
month
,
the
debate
among
federal
and
state
health
officials
about
who
goes
next
,
and
lobbying
from
outside
groups
to
be
included
,
is
growing
more
urgent.It
’
s
a
question
increasingly
guided
by
concerns
over
the
inequities
laid
bare
by
the
pandemic
,
from
disproportionately
high
rates
of
infection
and
death
among
poor
people
and
people
of
color
to
disparate
access
to
testing
,
child
care
and
technology
for
online
schooling.
“
It
’
s
damnable
that
we
are
even
being
placed
in
this
position
that
we
have
to
make
these
choices
,
”
said
the
Rev
.
William
J.
Barber
II
,
a
co-chairman
of
the
Poor
People
’
s
Campaign
,
a
national
coalition
that
calls
attention
to
the
challenges
of
the
working
poor
.
“
But
if
we
have
to
make
the
choice
,
we
can
not
once
again
leave
poor
and
low-wealth
essential
workers
to
be
last.
”
Ultimately
,
the
choice
comes
down
to
whether
preventing
death
or
curbing
the
spread
of
the
virus
and
returning
to
some
semblance
of
normalcy
is
the
highest
priority
.
“
If
your
goal
is
to
maximize
the
preservation
of
human
life
,
then
you
would
bias
the
vaccine
toward
older
Americans
,
”
Dr.
Scott
Gottlieb
,
the
former
Food
and
Drug
Administration
commissioner
,
said
recently
.
“
If
your
goal
is
to
reduce
the
rate
of
infection
,
then
you
would
prioritize
essential
workers
.
So
it
depends
what
impact
you
’
re
trying
to
achieve.
”
The
trade-off
between
the
two
is
muddied
by
the
fact
that
the
definition
of
“
essential
workers
”
used
by
the
C.D.C
.
comprises
nearly
70
percent
of
the
American
work
force
,
sweeping
in
not
just
grocery
store
clerks
and
emergency
responders
,
but
tugboat
operators
,
exterminators
and
nuclear
energy
workers
.
Some
labor
economists
and
public
health
officials
consider
the
category
overbroad
and
say
it
should
be
narrowed
to
only
those
who
interact
in
person
with
the
public.An
independent
committee
of
medical
experts
that
advises
the
C.D.C
.
on
immunization
practices
will
soon
vote
on
whom
to
recommend
for
the
second
phase
of
vaccination
—
“
Phase
1b.
”
In
a
meeting
last
month
,
all
voting
members
of
the
committee
indicated
support
for
putting
essential
workers
ahead
of
people
65
and
older
and
those
with
high-risk
health
conditions.Historically
,
the
committee
relied
on
scientific
evidence
to
inform
its
decisions
.
But
now
the
members
are
weighing
social
justice
concerns
as
well
,
noted
Lisa
A.
Prosser
,
a
professor
of
health
policy
and
decision
sciences
at
the
University
of
Michigan.
“
To
me
the
issue
of
ethics
is
very
significant
,
very
important
for
this
country
,
”
Dr.
Peter
Szilagyi
,
a
committee
member
and
a
pediatrics
professor
at
the
University
of
California
,
Los
Angeles
,
said
at
the
time
,
“
and
clearly
favors
the
essential
worker
group
because
of
the
high
proportion
of
minority
,
low-income
and
low-education
workers
among
essential
workers.
”
That
position
runs
counter
to
frameworks
proposed
by
the
World
Health
Organization
,
the
National
Academies
of
Sciences
,
Engineering
,
and
Medicine
,
and
many
countries
,
which
say
that
reducing
deaths
should
be
the
unequivocal
priority
and
that
older
and
sicker
people
should
thus
go
before
the
workers
,
a
view
shared
by
many
in
public
health
and
medicine.Dr
.
Robert
Redfield
,
the
C.D.C
.
director
and
the
nation
’
s
top
public
health
official
,
reminded
the
advisory
committee
of
the
importance
of
older
people
,
saying
in
a
statement
on
Thursday
that
he
looked
forward
to
“
future
recommendations
that
,
based
on
vaccine
availability
,
demonstrate
that
we
as
a
nation
also
prioritize
the
elderly.
”
Once
the
committee
votes
,
Dr.
Redfield
will
decide
whether
to
accept
its
recommendations
as
the
official
guidance
of
the
agency
.
Only
rarely
does
a
C.D.C
.
director
reject
a
recommendation
from
the
committee
,
whose
14
members
are
selected
by
the
Health
and
Human
Services
secretary
,
serve
four-and-a-half-year
terms
and
have
never
confronted
a
task
as
high
in
profile
as
this
one.But
ultimately
,
the
decision
will
be
up
to
governors
and
state
and
local
health
officials
.
They
are
not
required
to
follow
C.D.C
.
guidelines
,
though
historically
they
have
done
so.There
are
about
90
million
essential
workers
nationwide
,
as
defined
by
a
division
of
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security
that
compiled
a
roster
of
jobs
that
help
maintain
critical
infrastructure
during
a
pandemic
.
That
list
is
long
,
and
because
there
won
’
t
be
enough
doses
to
reach
everyone
at
first
,
states
are
preparing
to
make
tough
decisions
:
Louisiana
’
s
preliminary
plan
,
for
example
,
puts
prison
guards
and
food
processing
workers
ahead
of
teachers
and
grocery
employees
.
Nevada
’
s
prioritizes
education
and
public
transit
workers
over
those
in
retail
and
food
processing.At
this
early
point
,
many
state
plans
put
at
least
some
people
who
are
older
and
live
independently
,
or
people
who
have
medical
conditions
,
ahead
of
most
essential
workers
,
though
that
could
change
after
the
C.D.C
.
committee
makes
a
formal
recommendation
on
the
next
phase.One
occupation
whose
priority
is
being
hotly
debated
is
teaching
.
The
C.D.C
.
includes
educators
as
essential
workers
.
But
not
everyone
agrees
with
that
designation.Marc
Lipsitch
,
an
infectious-disease
epidemiologist
at
Harvard
’
s
T.H
.
Chan
School
of
Public
Health
,
argued
that
teachers
should
not
be
included
as
essential
workers
,
if
a
central
goal
of
the
committee
is
to
reduce
health
inequities.
“
Teachers
have
middle-class
salaries
,
are
very
often
white
,
and
they
have
college
degrees
,
”
he
said
.
“
Of
course
they
should
be
treated
better
,
but
they
are
not
among
the
most
mistreated
of
workers.
”
Elise
Gould
,
a
senior
economist
at
the
Economic
Policy
Institute
,
disagreed
.
Teachers
not
only
ensure
that
children
don
’
t
fall
further
behind
in
their
education
,
she
said
,
but
are
also
critical
to
the
work
force
at
large.
“
When
you
talk
about
disproportionate
impact
and
you
’
re
concerned
about
people
getting
back
into
the
labor
force
,
many
are
mothers
,
and
they
will
have
a
harder
time
if
their
children
don
’
t
have
a
reliable
place
to
go
,
”
she
said
.
“
And
if
you
think
generally
about
people
who
have
jobs
where
they
can
’
t
telework
,
they
are
disproportionately
Black
and
brown
.
They
’
ll
have
more
of
a
challenge
when
child
care
is
an
issue.
”
In
September
,
academic
researchers
analyzed
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security
’
s
list
of
essential
workers
and
found
that
it
broadly
mirrored
the
demographics
of
the
American
labor
force
.
The
researchers
proposed
a
narrower
,
more
vulnerable
category
—
“
frontline
workers
,
”
such
as
food
deliverers
,
cashiers
and
emergency
medical
technicians
,
who
must
work
face
to
face
with
others
and
are
thus
at
greater
risk
of
contracting
the
virus.By
this
definition
,
said
Francine
D.
Blau
,
a
labor
economist
at
Cornell
University
and
an
author
of
the
study
,
teachers
belong
in
the
larger
category
of
essential
workers
.
However
,
when
they
work
in
classrooms
rather
than
remotely
,
she
said
,
they
would
fit
into
the
“
frontline
”
group
.
Individual
states
categorize
teachers
differently.Dr
.
Blau
said
that
if
supplies
are
short
,
frontline
workers
should
be
emphasized
.
“
These
are
a
subset
of
essential
workers
who
,
given
the
nature
of
their
jobs
,
must
provide
their
labor
in
person
.
Prioritizing
them
makes
sense
given
the
heightened
risk
that
they
face.
”
The
analysis
,
a
working
paper
for
the
National
Bureau
of
Economic
Research
,
is
in
line
with
other
critics
,
who
say
that
the
list
of
essential
workers
is
too
wide-ranging.
“
If
groups
are
too
large
,
then
you
’
re
not
really
focusing
on
priorities
,
”
said
Saad
B.
Omer
,
director
of
the
Yale
Institute
for
Global
Health
,
who
worked
on
the
vaccination
frameworks
for
the
W.H.O
.
and
the
National
Academies.The
essential
workers
on
the
federal
list
make
up
nearly
70
percent
of
the
American
labor
force
,
the
researchers
said
,
compared
with
42
percent
for
the
frontline
workers
.
Women
made
up
39
percent
of
frontline
workers
and
,
in
certain
occupations
,
far
more
.
Frontline
workers
’
education
levels
are
lower
,
as
are
their
wages
—
on
average
,
just
under
$
22
an
hour
.
The
proportion
of
Black
and
Hispanic
workers
is
higher
than
in
the
broader
category
of
essential
workers.Some
health
policy
experts
said
that
to
prioritize
preventing
deaths
rather
than
reducing
virus
transmission
was
simply
a
pragmatic
choice
,
because
there
won
’
t
be
enough
vaccine
initially
available
to
make
a
meaningful
dent
in
contagion
.
A
more
effective
use
of
limited
quantities
,
they
say
,
is
to
save
the
lives
of
the
most
frail.Moreover
,
vaccine
trial
results
so
far
show
only
that
the
shots
can
protect
the
individuals
who
receive
them
.
The
trials
have
not
yet
demonstrated
that
a
vaccinated
person
would
not
infect
others
.
Though
scientists
believe
that
is
likely
to
be
the
case
,
it
has
yet
to
be
proved.Harald
Schmidt
,
an
expert
in
ethics
and
health
policy
at
the
University
of
Pennsylvania
,
said
that
it
is
reasonable
to
put
essential
workers
ahead
of
older
adults
,
given
their
risks
,
and
that
they
are
disproportionately
minorities
.
“
Older
populations
are
whiter
,
”
Dr.
Schmidt
said
.
“
Society
is
structured
in
a
way
that
enables
them
to
live
longer
.
Instead
of
giving
additional
health
benefits
to
those
who
already
had
more
of
them
,
we
can
start
to
level
the
playing
field
a
bit.
”
But
to
protect
older
people
more
at
risk
,
he
called
on
the
C.D.C
.
committee
to
also
integrate
the
agency
’
s
own
“
social
vulnerability
index.
”
The
index
includes
15
measures
derived
from
the
census
,
such
as
overcrowded
housing
,
lack
of
vehicle
access
and
poverty
,
to
determine
how
urgently
a
community
needs
health
support
,
with
the
goal
of
reducing
inequities.In
a
new
analysis
of
the
states
’
preliminary
vaccine
plans
,
Dr.
Schmidt
found
that
at
least
18
states
intended
to
apply
the
index
.
Tennessee
,
for
one
,
has
indicated
that
it
will
reserve
some
of
its
early
allotments
for
disadvantaged
communities.Still
,
some
people
believe
it
is
wrong
to
give
racial
and
socioeconomic
equity
more
weight
than
who
is
most
likely
to
die.
“
They
need
to
have
bombproof
,
fact-based
,
public-health-based
reasons
for
why
one
group
goes
ahead
of
another
,
”
said
Chuck
Ludlam
,
a
former
Senate
aide
and
biotech
industry
lobbyist
who
protested
putting
essential
workers
ahead
of
older
people
in
comments
to
the
committee
.
“
They
have
provided
no
explanation
here
that
will
withstand
public
scrutiny.
”
Further
complicating
matters
,
the
different
priority
groups
discussed
by
the
C.D.C
.
committee
are
overlapping
—
many
essential
workers
have
high-risk
conditions
,
and
some
are
older
than
65
.
Some
states
have
suggested
that
they
will
prioritize
only
essential
workers
who
come
face
to
face
with
the
public
,
while
others
have
not
prioritized
them
at
all.Even
some
people
whose
allegiance
lies
with
one
group
have
made
the
case
that
others
should
have
an
earlier
claim
on
the
vaccine
.
Marc
Perrone
,
president
of
the
United
Food
and
Commercial
Workers
Union
,
which
represents
1.3
million
grocery
and
food
processing
workers
,
said
that
despite
the
high
rate
of
infection
among
his
members
,
he
thought
that
older
adults
should
go
first.
“
Here
’
s
the
thing
:
Everybody
’
s
got
a
grandmother
or
grandfather
,
”
Mr.
Perrone
said
.
“
And
I
do
believe
almost
everybody
in
this
country
would
want
to
protect
them
,
or
their
aging
parents.
”
But
Dr.
Nirav
Shah
,
Maine
’
s
top
public
health
official
,
said
he
respectfully
disagreed
,
repeating
the
explanation
he
had
given
his
in-laws
—
who
are
older
but
in
good
health
and
able
to
socially
distance.He
said
:
“
I
’
ve
told
them
:
‘
You
know
what
?
I
’
m
sorry
,
but
there
are
others
that
I
need
to
get
this
vaccine
to
first
,
so
that
when
you
guys
get
vaccinated
,
the
world
you
come
back
into
is
ready
to
receive
you.
’
”
All
these
plans
are
,
of
course
,
unfurling
with
essential
information
still
unknown.Many
state
officials
said
that
as
on-the-ground
realities
emerge
,
they
fully
expect
their
plans
to
evolve.One
uncertainty
:
given
the
high
rates
of
apprehension
swirling
around
this
vaccine
,
how
many
people
in
the
early
groups
will
actually
line
up
for
it
?
“
If
a
high
proportion
of
essential
workers
decline
to
get
the
vaccine
,
states
will
have
to
quickly
move
onto
the
next
group
anyway
,
”
said
Dr.
Prosser
,
the
University
of
Michigan
health
analyst
.
“
Because
once
the
vaccines
arrive
,
they
will
have
to
be
used
in
a
certain
amount
of
time
before
they
degrade
.
``
Early
results
from
a
British
vaccine
study
suggest
that
mixing
different
brands
of
vaccines
can
provoke
a
protective
immune
response
against
Covid-19
.
In
the
trial
,
volunteers
produced
high
levels
of
antibodies
and
immune
cells
after
getting
one
dose
of
the
Pfizer-BioNTech
vaccine
and
one
dose
of
the
AstraZeneca-Oxford
shot.Administering
the
vaccines
in
either
order
is
likely
to
provide
potent
protection
,
Matthew
Snape
,
a
vaccine
expert
at
the
University
of
Oxford
,
said
at
a
news
conference
on
Monday
.
“
Any
of
these
schedules
,
I
think
could
be
argued
,
would
be
expected
to
be
effective
,
”
he
said.Dr
.
Snape
and
his
colleagues
began
the
trial
,
called
Com-COV
,
in
February
.
In
the
first
wave
of
the
study
,
they
gave
830
volunteers
one
of
four
combinations
of
vaccines
.
Some
got
two
doses
of
either
Pfizer
or
AstraZeneca
,
both
of
which
have
been
shown
to
be
effective
against
Covid-19
.
Others
got
a
dose
of
AstraZeneca
,
followed
by
one
of
Pfizer
,
or
vice
versa.For
the
first
wave
of
volunteers
,
the
researchers
waited
four
weeks
between
doses
.
Studies
have
found
that
the
AstraZeneca
vaccine
provides
stronger
protection
if
the
second
dose
is
delayed
for
up
to
12
weeks
,
so
the
researchers
are
also
running
a
separate
12-week
trial
which
should
deliver
results
next
month.The
researchers
found
that
volunteers
reported
more
chills
,
headaches
and
muscle
pain
than
people
who
get
two
doses
of
the
same
vaccine
.
But
the
side
effects
were
short-lived.Dr
.
Snape
and
his
colleagues
then
drew
blood
to
measure
the
immune
response
in
the
volunteers
.
They
found
that
those
who
got
two
doses
of
Pfizer-BioNTech
produced
levels
of
antibodies
about
10
times
as
high
as
those
who
got
two
doses
of
AstraZeneca
.
Volunteers
who
got
Pfizer
followed
by
AstraZeneca
showed
antibody
levels
about
five
times
as
high
as
those
with
two
doses
of
AstraZeneca
.
And
volunteers
who
got
AstraZeneca
followed
by
Pfizer
reached
antibody
levels
about
as
high
as
those
who
got
two
doses
of
Pfizer.Dr
.
Snape
said
that
the
differences
would
most
likely
narrow
in
the
volunteers
who
get
a
second
dose
after
12
weeks
,
when
the
AstraZeneca
vaccine
has
had
more
time
to
strengthen
its
effects.The
study
also
found
that
using
different
vaccines
produced
a
higher
level
of
immune
cells
primed
to
attack
the
coronavirus
than
did
giving
two
doses
of
the
same
vaccine
.
Dr.
Snape
said
it
wasn
’
t
clear
yet
why
mixing
had
that
advantage

“
It
’

very
intriguing
,
let
’
s
say
that
much
,
”
he
said.Dr
.
Snape
and
his
colleagues
have
begun
a
similar
trial
,
adding
vaccines
from
Moderna
and
Novavax
to
the
list
of
possibilities.For
now
,
he
said
,
the
best
course
of
action
remains
getting
two
doses
of
the
same
vaccine
.
Large
clinical
trials
have
clearly
demonstrated
that
this
strategy
reduces
the
chances
of
getting
Covid-19
.
“
Your
default
should
be
what
is
proven
to
work
,
”
Dr.
Snape
said.But
there
are
many
cases
in
which
that
may
not
be
possible
.
Vaccine
shipments
are
sometimes
delayed
because
of
manufacturing
problems
,
for
example
.
Younger
people
in
some
countries
have
been
advised
not
to
get
a
second
dose
of
AstraZeneca
because
of
concerns
about
the
small
risk
of
developing
blood
clots
.
In
such
situations
,
it
’
s
important
to
know
whether
people
can
switch
to
another
vaccine.
“
This
provides
reassuring
evidence
that
should
work

PMScience
’
s
COVID-19
reporting
is
supported
by
the
Heising-Simons
Foundation.In
a
world
starved
for
any
fresh
data
to
help
clarify
the
origin
of
the
COVID-19
pandemic
,
a
study
claiming
to
have
unearthed
early
sequences
of
SARS-CoV-2
that
were
deliberately
hidden
was
bound
to
ignite
a
sizzling
debate
.
The
unreviewed
paper
,
by
evolutionary
biologist
Jesse
Bloom
of
the
Fred
Hutchinson
Cancer
Research
Center
,
asserts
that
a
team
of
Chinese
researchers
sampled
viruses
from
some
of
the
earliest
COVID-19
patients
in
Wuhan
,
China
,
posted
the
viral
sequences
to
a
widely
used
U.S.
database
,
and
then
a
few
months
later
had
the
genetic
information
removed
to
“
obscure
their
existence.
”
To
some
scientists
,
the
claims
reinforce
suspicions
that
China
has
something
to
hide
about
the
origins
of
the
pandemic
.
But
critics
of
the
preprint
,
posted
yesterday
on
bioRxiv
,
say
Bloom
’
s
detective
work
is
much
ado
about
nothing
,
because
the
Chinese
scientists
later
published
the
viral
information
in
a
different
form
,
and
the
recovered
sequences
add
little
to
what
’
s
known
about
SARS-CoV-2
’
s
origins.The
sequences
,
Bloom
says
,
do
support
other
evidence
that
the
pandemic
did
not
originate
in
Wuhan
’
s
Huanan
Seafood
Market
,
where
SARS-CoV-2
initially
came
to
light
.
Chinese
health
officials
on
31
December
2019
tied
the
market
to
an
outbreak
of
an
“
unexplained
pneumonia
,
”
but
1
month
later
it
had
become
clear
that
many
of
the
earliest
cases
had
no
link
to
the
location
.
The
paper
highlights
three
mutations
found
in
SARS-CoV-2
collected
from
patients
linked
to
the
market
that
are
not
in
the
unearthed
sequences
of
the
coronavirus
or
its
closest
relative
,
which
researchers
from
the
Wuhan
Institute
of
Virology
discovered
in
bats
in
2013.Bloom
’
s
more
explosive
assertion
,
that
the
Chinese
researchers
deleted
data
,
is
bound
to
intensify
the
debate
about
whether
the
virus
originally
jumped
to
humans
from
an
unknown
animal
or
somehow
leaked
from
a
laboratory
.
Bloom
says
he
has
no
bias
toward
a
particular
origin
hypothesis
for
SARS-CoV-2
,
and
he
agrees
that
the
viral
sequences
he
highlighted
are
a
small
piece
of
a
large
unfinished
puzzle
.
“
I
don
’
t
think
this
bolsters
either
the
lab
origin
or
zoonosis
hypothesis
,
”
he
says
.
“
I
think
it
provides
additional
evidence
that
this
virus
was
probably
circulating
in
Wuhan
before
December
,
certainly
,
and
that
probably
,
we
have
a
less
than
complete
picture
of
the
sequences
of
the
early
viruses.
”
Bloom
,
who
studies
viral
evolution
,
launched
his
study
after
a
controversial
report
on
the
pandemic
’
s
origin
issued
in
March
by
a
joint
commission
of
Chinese
and
foreign
researchers
organized
by
the
World
Health
Organization
(
WHO
)
.
Bloom
helped
organize
a
much
discussed
letter
,
cosigned
by
17
other
scientists
,
that
criticized
the
WHO
report
for
deeming
it
“
extremely
unlikely
”
that
SARS-CoV-2
escaped
from
a
laboratory
.
In
the
letter
,
published
on
14
May
in
Science
,
the
authors
argued
for
“
a
dispassionate
science-based
discourse
on
this
difficult
but
important
issue.
”
The
WHO
report
relied
heavily
on
sequences
of
SARS-CoV-2
found
in
COVID-19
patients
tied
to
the
market
,
Bloom
notes
.
“
I
was
just
going
through
and
trying
to
repeat
a
number
of
the
analyses
in
the
joint
WHO-China
report
,
”
Bloom
says
.
This
led
him
to
a
study
that
listed
all
SARS-CoV-2
sequences
submitted
before
31
March
2020
to
the
Sequence
Read
Archive
(
SRA
)
,
a
database
overseen
by
the
National
Center
for
Biotechnology
Information
,
a
division
of
the
U.S.
National
Institutes
of
Health
(
NIH
)
.
But
when
he
checked
the
SRA
for
one
of
the
listed
projects
,
he
couldn
’
t
find
its
sequences.Googling
some
of
the
project
’
s
information
,
he
found
another
study
,
led
by
Ming
Wang
from
Wuhan
University
’
s
Renmin
Hospital
,
that
was
posted
as
a
preprint
on
6
March
on
medRxiv
and
later
published
on
24
June
in
Small
,
a
journal
more
focused
on
materials
and
chemistry
than
virology
.
That
paper
lists
some
of
the
earliest
Wuhan
COVID-19
patients
and
the
specific
mutations
in
their
viruses
,
but
doesn
’
t
give
the
full
sequence
data
.
Further
internet
sleuthing
led
Bloom
to
discover
the
SRA
backs
up
its
information
in
Google
’
s
Cloud
platform
,
and
a
search
there
turned
up
files
containing
some
of
the
Wang
team
’
s
earlier
data
submissions.The
paper
in
Small
makes
no
mention
of
any
corrections
to
viral
sequences
that
might
explain
why
they
were
removed
from
the
SRA
,
which
led
Bloom
to
conclude
in
his
preprint
that
“
the
trusting
structures
of
science
have
been
abused
to
obscure
sequences
relevant
to
the
early
spread
of
SARS-CoV-2
in
Wuhan.
”
Bloom
asserts
that
because
the
deleted
sequences
lack
the
three
mutations
seen
in
the
SARS-CoV-2
from
the
seafood
market
,
the
viruses
Wang
’
s
team
found
more
likely
represent
a
progenitor.But
the
sequence
of
that
bat
virus
found
in
2013
differs
from
SARS-CoV-2
by
about
1100
nucleotides
,
which
means
decades
must
have
passed
before
it
evolved
into
the
pandemic
coronavirus—and
other
species
may
well
have
been
infected
with
the
bat
virus
before
it
made
the
final
jump
into
people
.
This
great
difference
in
sequences
,
says
evolutionary
biologist
Andrew
Rambaut
at
the
University
of
Edinburgh
,
means
researchers
can
not
use
a
few
mutations
like
the
ones
Bloom
highlights
to
look
back
in
time
to
see
the
“
roots
”
of
the
family
tree
of
SARS-CoV-2
tree.Bloom
says
he
contacted
the
Chinese
researchers
to
ask
why
they
removed
the
SRA
data
,
but
they
did
not
reply
.
(
Science
also
received
no
reply
after
emailing
the
lead
authors
.
)
NIH
issued
a
statement
today
saying
it
removed
the
sequences
at
the
request
of
the
submitting
investigator
,
who
the
agency
says
holds
the
rights
to
the
data
.
The
scientist
“
indicated
the
sequence
information
had
been
updated
,
was
being
submitted
to
another
database
,
and
wanted
the
data
removed
from
SRA
to
avoid
version
control
issues
,
”
NIH
said
.
(
Bloom
says
he
can
not
find
the
sequences
in
any
other
virology
database
he
knows
.
)
Researchers
are
sharply
divided
about
the
value
of
Bloom
’
s
resurrection
of
the
SRA
data
.
“
This
is
a
creative
and
rigorous
approach
to
investigating
the
provenance
of
SARS-CoV-2
,
”
says
Ian
Lipkin
,
a
microbiologist
at
Columbia
University
’
s
Mailman
School
of
Public
Health
.
“
The
two
take-home
points
are
that
the
virus
was
circulating
before
the
outbreak
linked
to
the
Wuhan
Seafood
Market
,
and
that
there
may
have
been
active
suppression
of
epidemiological
and
sequence
data
needed
to
track
its
origin.
”
Leaving
aside
the
meaning
of
the
sequences
Bloom
found
,
the
demonstration
that
researchers
can
potentially
find
“
new
”
data
in
the
cloud
is
an
exciting
advance
,
adds
Sudhir
Kumar
,
who
does
genomics
research
at
Temple
University
and
has
published
his
own
analysis
of
early
SARS-CoV-2
sequences
,
“
Many
people
feel
that
there
is
a
lot
more
Chinese
data
out
there
,
and
they
don
’
t
have
access
to
it
,
”
he
says.Others
are
underwhelmed
.
“
Jesse
is
resurfacing
info
that
’
s
been
online
for
over
a
year
and
claiming
it
proves
a
cover-up
,
”
says
Stephen
Goldstein
,
an
evolutionary
virologist
at
the
University
of
Utah
.
“
I
don
’
t
understand
[
his
reasoning
]
.
”
The
Small
paper
is
simply
a
good
study
that
“
unfortunately
flew
below
the
radar
,
”
he
adds.Rambaut
notes
that
the
Chinese
researchers
submitted
their
Small
paper
before
requesting
that
the
SRA
remove
the
data
.
“
The
idea
that
the
group
was
trying
to
hide
something
is
farcical
,
”
Rambaut
says
.
“
If
they
were
covering
something
[
up
]
they
surely
would
have
not
submitted
the
paper
.
…
I
don
’
t
like
the
insinuations
about
malfeasance
where
[
Bloom
]
has
zero
knowledge
of
the
reasons
the
authors
of
the
paper
had
for
removing
their
data.
”
A
member
of
the
WHO
origin
commission
,
Marion
Koopmans
from
the
Erasmus
University
Medical
Center
,
notes
that
its
report
stresses
the
need
to
find
more
data
about
the
earliest
viruses
in
circulation
.
“
It
’
s
good
to
see
additional
data
,
but
I
’
m
not
sure
what
point
this
makes
,
”
Koopmans
says
,
adding
that
the
preprint
’
s
accusations
could
harm
future
collaborations
on
origin
studies
with
Chinese
researchers
.
“
The
tone
of
the
intro
is
in
my
view
rather
suggestive
and
I
wish
science
would
stay
away
from
this.
”
Bloom
acknowledges
that
researchers
can
piece
together
the
coronavirus
sequences
from
the
data
found
in
the
Small
paper
,
but
he
says
that
’
s
not
the
way
most
in
the
field
conduct
evolutionary
analyses
of
SARS-CoV-2
.
“
No
one
knew
about
these
sequences
because
the
way
that
people
find
sequences
is
to
go
to
the
sequence
databases
and
download
the
sequences
and
look
at
them
,
”
Bloom
says.Stepping
into
the
divisive
discussion
of
SARS-CoV-2
’
s
origin
comes
at
a
price
,
he
acknowledges
.
“
So
many
people
have
agendas
and
preconceived
notions
on
this
topic
that
if
you
open
your
mouth
on
the
topic
,
someone
’
s
going
to
take
what
you
’
ve
said
to
support
or
reject
some
particular
narrative
,
”
he
says
.
“
So
the
choices
are
either
not
to
say
anything
at
all
,
which
I
don
’
t
think
is
useful
or
productive
,
or
just
to
try
to
draw
the
conclusions
you
can
and
make
it
as
transparent
as
possible
.
No
matter
how
much
people
like
[
my
new
study
]
or
don
’
t
like
it
,
or
agree
with
the
interpretation
or
disagree
with
the
interpretation
,
they
can
at
least
go
download
it
and
repeat
it
themselves

’
s
COVID-19
reporting
is
supported
by
the
Heising-Simons
Foundation.When
the
coronavirus
variant
now
called
Delta
first
appeared
in
December
2020
,
in
the
Indian
state
of
Maharashtra
,
it
did
not
seem
all
that
remarkable
.
But
when
it
descended
on
New
Delhi
a
few
months
later
,
its
impact
was
devastating
,
with
almost
30,000
cases
reported
daily
in
late
April
.
“
Suddenly
…
it
is
dominant
and
completely
sweeps
away
Alpha
,
”
which
until
then
was
most
prevalent
in
the
city
,
says
Anurag
Agrawal
,
who
leads
the
Institute
of
Genomics
and
Integrative
Biology
in
New
Delhi.New
Delhi
seemed
unlikely
to
suffer
a
big
new
outbreak
because
so
many
of
its
residents
had
already
been
infected
or
vaccinated
,
Agrawal
says
.
But
those
protections
seemed
to
barely
slow
Delta
,
which
is
more
transmissible
and
may
evade
immunity
,
he
says
:
“
It
went
from
a
10-foot
wall
around
the
city
to
a
2-foot
wall
you
could
just
walk
over.
”
From
New
Delhi
,
the
variant
has
quickly
spread
,
and
it
now
looks
set
to
sweep
the
globe
in
what
could
be
a
devastating
new
wave
.
In
the
United
Kingdom
,
Delta
already
makes
up
more
than
90
%
of
all
infections
;
it
has
driven
COVID-19
case
numbers
up
again
after
a
dramatic
decline
and
led
the
government
last
week
to
postpone
the
final
stage
of
its
reopening
plan
.
A
Delta-driven
resurgence
in
Lisbon
prompted
the
Portuguese
government
to
enact
a
3-day
travel
ban
between
the
city
and
the
rest
of
the
country
.
The
variant
may
account
for
90
%
of
all
COVID-19
cases
in
the
European
Union
by
the
end
of
August
,
Andrea
Ammon
,
the
head
of
the
European
Centre
for
Disease
Prevention
and
Control
,
warned
today
.
“
It
is
very
likely
that
the
Delta
variant
will
circulate
extensively
during
the
summer
,
particularly
among
younger
individuals
that
are
not
targeted
for
vaccination
,
''
she
said
.
``
This
could
cause
a
risk
for
the
more
vulnerable
individuals
to
be
infected
and
experience
severe
illness
and
death
if
they
are
not
fully
vaccinated.
“
Delta
also
appears
to
be
causing
surges
in
Russia
,
Indonesia
,
and
many
other
countries
.
In
the
United
States
,
where
its
prevalence
is
now
estimated
to
be
at
least
14
%
,
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
declared
Delta
a
“
variant
of
concern
”
on
15
June.The
surge
has
set
off
a
frenzy
of
research
to
understand
why
Delta
appears
to
spread
so
much
faster
than
the
three
other
variants
of
concern
,
whether
it
is
more
dangerous
in
other
ways
,
and
how
its
unique
pattern
of
mutations
,
which
cause
subtle
changes
in
its
proteins
,
can
wreak
havoc
.
Delta
’
s
arrival
has
also
brought
fresh
attention
to
the
potential
of
SARS-CoV-2
to
evolve
and
adapt
in
the
months
and
years
ahead
.
For
the
moment
,
Delta
is
a
particular
threat
to
the
poorest
countries
with
little
or
no
access
to
vaccines
,
says
Soumya
Swaminathan
,
chief
science
adviser
at
the
World
Health
Organization
.
“
My
immediate
worry
is
what
will
happen
when
Delta
is
introduced
into
Africa
,
”
she
says.
“
You
could
end
up
with
explosive
outbreaks.
”
Research
by
Public
Health
England
underscores
Delta
’
s
ability
to
spread
.
Compared
with
Alpha
,
which
appeared
in
the
United
Kingdom
in
2020
,
“
You
’
re
getting
estimates
of
50
%
or
100
%
more
transmission
,
”
says
Adam
Kucharski
,
a
modeler
at
the
London
School
of
Hygiene
&
Tropical
Medicine.But
Kucharski
says
reduced
protection
from
vaccines
may
play
a
role
as
well
.
Data
from
England
and
Scotland
indicate
that
both
the
Pfizer-BioNTech
and
AstraZeneca
vaccines
offer
slightly
less
protection
against
symptomatic
infections
from
the
new
variant
than
from
Alpha
.
People
who
have
received
just
one
shot
of
vaccine—as
many
U.K.
residents
have—are
especially
vulnerable
.
(
Two
doses
of
either
vaccine
still
offer
the
same
high
level
of
protection
from
hospitalization
from
Delta
.
)
How
well
the
many
other
vaccines
now
in
use
around
the
world
protect
against
it
is
unclear
,
and
there
are
few
data
on
the
protection
resulting
from
a
prior
bout
of
COVID-19.The
spike
protein
’
s
N-terminal
domain
(
left
)
includes
a
“
supersite
”
where
powerful
antibodies
latch
on
to
the
virus
(
middle
)
.
Mutations
there
(
right
)
can
prevent
them
from
binding.The
two
effects—increased
transmissibility
and
immune
evasion—are
hard
to
disentangle
,
but
“
I
would
argue
the
Delta
variant
has
been
driven
by
its
transmissibility
,
not
its
ability
to
escape
immunity
,
”
says
Jeremy
Farrar
,
head
of
the
Wellcome
Trust
.
“
If
Alpha
really
is
approximately
50
%
more
transmissible
than
the
wild
type
strain
,
and
Delta
is
50
%
more
transmissible
again
than
Alpha
,
we
’
re
talking
about
a
virus
that
’
s
more
than
twice
as
transmissible
as
the
initial
strain
,
”
adds
Aris
Katzourakis
,
an
evolutionary
virologist
at
the
University
of
Oxford
.
That
would
mean
countries
and
populations
with
low
vaccination
rates
are
likely
to
see
big
new
outbreaks
.
Indeed
,
if
the
faster
spread
“
is
entirely
down
to
the
fundamentals
of
the
virus
,
that
’
s
catastrophic
news
for
the
rest
of
the
world
,
”
Kucharski
says.On
top
of
this
,
Delta
may
be
more
likely
to
put
unvaccinated
people
in
the
hospital
than
Alpha
.
Early
data
from
the
United
Kingdom
suggest
the
risk
of
hospitalization
may
be
twice
as
high
.
Together
these
characteristics
could
cause
huge
problems
in
Africa
,
Swaminathan
says
.
“
There
isn
’
t
going
to
be
enough
oxygen
there
,
there
aren
’
t
going
to
be
enough
hospital
beds
.
And
we
already
know
that
outcomes
for
people
that
are
hospitalized
in
Africa
are
worse
than
in
other
countries
,
”
she
says
.
“
So
this
could
really
lead
to
higher
mortality
,
even
among
younger
people.
”
Scientists
are
just
beginning
to
probe
what
makes
Delta
so
dangerous
.
They
’
re
concentrating
on
a
suite
of
nine
mutations
in
the
gene
encoding
spike
,
the
protein
that
studs
the
virus
’
surface
and
allows
it
to
invade
human
cells
.
One
important
mutation
,
called
P681R
,
changes
an
amino
acid
at
a
spot
directly
beside
the
furin
cleavage
site
,
where
a
human
enzyme
cuts
the
protein
,
a
key
step
enabling
the
virus
to
invade
human
cells
.
In
the
Alpha
variant
,
a
mutation
at
that
site
made
cleavage
more
efficient
;
a
preprint
published
in
late
May
showed
Delta
’
s
different
change
makes
furin
cleavage
even
easier
.
The
researchers
suggest
this
could
make
the
virus
more
transmissible.Japanese
researchers
who
made
pseudo-viruses
carrying
the
mutation
have
not
found
it
to
confer
increased
infectivity
in
the
lab
,
however
,
and
in
India
,
other
coronavirus
variants
that
include
the
same
mutation
have
been
far
less
successful
than
Delta
,
says
evolutionary
virologist
Andrew
Rambaut
of
the
University
of
Edinburgh
.
“
So
it
must
be
an
interaction
with
something
else
in
the
genome.
”
Other
mutations
in
Delta
could
help
it
thwart
immunity
.
Some
alter
the
spike
’
s
N-terminal
domain
(
NTD
)
,
which
protrudes
from
the
protein
’
s
surface
.
A
recent
Cell
paper
identified
one
spot
in
the
NTD
as
a
“
supersite
,
”
unfailingly
targeted
by
“
ultra-potent
”
neutralizing
antibodies
from
recovered
patients
.
Delta
’
s
unique
mutations
delete
the
amino
acids
at
positions
156
and
157
in
the
supersite
and
changes
the
158th
amino
acid
from
arginine
to
glycine
;
the
latter
eliminates
a
direct
contact
point
for
antibody
binding
,
says
David
Ostrov
,
a
structural
biologist
at
the
University
of
Florida
.
“
We
think
the
157/158
mutation
is
one
of
the
hallmark
mutations
in
Delta
that
has
given
it
this
more
immune-evasion
phenotype
,
”
concurs
Trevor
Bedford
,
a
computational
biologist
at
the
Fred
Hutchinson
Cancer
Research
Center.Another
mutation
in
the
NTD
supersite
may
also
help
rebuff
antibodies
.
And
scientists
should
start
to
examine
the
role
of
changes
in
other
Delta
variant
proteins
,
says
Nevan
Krogan
,
a
molecular
biologist
at
the
University
of
California
,
San
Francisco
.
“
There
is
so
much
we
don
’
t
know
about
these
variants
on
every
level
.
We
are
so
in
the
dark.
”
Delta
has
several
mutations
in
the
nucleocapsid
protein
,
for
example
,
which
has
many
jobs
,
“
like
a
Swiss
Army
Knife
protein
,
”
says
virologist
David
Bauer
of
the
Francis
Crick
Institute
.
The
experiments
to
bring
clarity
will
take
months
,
however.In
the
meantime
,
scientists
agree
urgent
action
is
needed
to
stop
the
spread
of
the
new
variant
.
“
Worries
about
Delta
should
galvanize
us
to
really
ramp
up
vaccination
efforts
and
surge
vaccines
to
places
where
Delta
is
ticking
up
,
”
says
virologist
Angela
Rasmussen
of
the
University
of
Saskatchewan
.
U.S.
President
Joe
Biden
has
urged
Americans
to
get
fully
vaccinated
to
protect
themselves
from
Delta
.
Ammon
today
called
on
European
countries
to
accelerate
plans
to
fully
vaccinate
vulnerable
populations
;
in
the
meantime
,
she
said
,
restrictions
should
be
kept
in
place
to
keep
the
new
variant
from
spreading
and
causing
another
surge
in
cases
,
hospitalizations
,
and
deaths
.
Countries
with
little
access
to
vaccine
need
to
resort
again
to
interventions
such
as
physical
distancing
and
masks
,
Rasmussen
says
.
And
in
Europe
,
Ammon
asked
countries
to
do
both
:
keep
restrictions
in
place
while
pushing
to
fully
vaccinate
vulnerable
populations.The
goal
is
not
just
to
save
lives
immediately
,
but
also
to
give
the
virus
less
room
to
evolve
further
.
Delta
’
s
success
has
shown
scientists
aren
’
t
able
to
identify
dangerous
new
variants
in
time
to
stop
them
spreading
,
says
Emma
Hodcroft
,
a
virologist
at
the
University
of
Basel
,
despite
an
unprecedented
global
effort
to
track
its
evolution
in
real
time
.
And
it
would
be
dangerous
to
assume
that
SARS-CoV-2
can
’
t
do
much
better
,
Katzourakis
says
.
“
Anything
that
’
s
happened
at
least
twice
in
evolution
is
part
of
a
pattern
,
”
he
says
.
“
I
would
be
very
unsurprised
if
we
saw
equivalent
changes
over
the
coming
year
or
two

PMScience
’
s
COVID-19
reporting
is
supported
by
the
Heising-Simons
Foundation.A
few
months
ago
,
transplant
surgeon
Dorry
Segev
was
despondent
about
how
COVID-19
vaccines
were
performing
in
patients
like
his
,
who
have
a
donated
organ
and
take
powerful
drugs
to
suppress
their
immune
system
.
After
one
dose
of
a
highly
effective
messenger
RNA
(
mRNA
)
vaccine
,
for
example
,
just
17
%
of
those
patients
churned
out
protective
antibodies
against
the
pandemic
coronavirus
,
and
after
the
standard
two
doses
,
only
54
%
did
.
The
very
medications
his
patients
took
to
protect
their
transplanted
organ
precluded
them
from
mounting
a
healthy
immune
response
after
the
vaccine
.
Even
people
who
did
make
the
antiviral
antibodies
often
had
very
low
levels
,
raising
questions
about
how
well
they
were
shielded
from
COVID-19.But
now
Segev
,
at
Johns
Hopkins
University
,
has
become
cautiously
optimistic
.
He
and
his
colleagues
have
found
that
a
third
dose
of
vaccine
may
help
:
Among
24
organ
transplant
patients
who
had
no
antibodies
after
two
doses
,
eight
people
generated
protective
antibodies
after
they
sought
out
a
third
on
their
own
.
Six
people
who
had
few
antibodies
against
the
coronavirus
after
two
doses
all
wound
up
with
high
levels
after
a
third
shot
,
the
researchers
reported
today
in
the
Annals
of
Internal
Medicine
.
Although
Segev
didn
’
t
conduct
a
systematic
study—the
30
patients
got
combinations
of
different
vaccines
at
different
time
intervals—
“
this
gives
hope
,
which
is
critical
right
now
,
”
he
says
.
“
There
is
some
encouraging
evidence
that
we
will
be
able
to
help
the
immune
system
do
what
it
needs
to
do.
”
The
organ
transplant
recipients
are
participants
in
a
research
project
Segev
and
his
colleagues
are
running
,
studying
COVID-19
vaccine
responses
in
people
with
compromised
immune
systems
.
In
this
case
,
“
We
just
got
emails
from
people
saying
,
‘
Hey
,
I
’
m
getting
a
third
dose
,
do
you
want
my
blood
?
’
”
Segev
says
.
He
jumped
at
the
opportunity
.
(
In
the
United
States
,
determined
individuals
can
secure
extra
vaccine
doses
despite
the
current
authorized
mRNA
vaccines
using
just
two
.
)
Segev
’
s
study
is
the
first
to
report
outcomes
after
a
third
dose
of
vaccine
,
and
it
’
s
part
of
a
broader
discussion
about
whether
and
when
to
offer
extra
doses
to
vulnerable
individuals
.
In
France
,
health
officials
in
April
recommended
a
third
dose
for
all
of
the
country
’
s
organ
recipients
.
Because
of
that
policy
shift
,
383
kidney
transplant
recipients
at
Strasbourg
University
Hospital
have
received
a
third
dose
of
Moderna
’
s
mRNA
vaccine
,
and
doctors
have
antibody
results
for
184
of
them
.
Although
the
results
aren
’
t
yet
published
,
they
roughly
match
Segev
’
s
small
cohort
:
Twenty-eight
percent
of
the
French
patients
who
had
no
antibodies
after
two
doses
developed
them
after
the
third
shot
,
and
82
%
who
had
a
weak
reaction
after
two
shots
had
a
stronger
response
after
the
third
,
says
Sophie
Ohlmann
,
a
nephrologist
at
the
hospital.In
the
United
States
,
people
with
organ
transplants
number
about
500,000
,
but
they
aren
’
t
the
only
ones
worrying
about
how
well
the
vaccines
are
working
for
them—others
include
people
with
autoimmune
diseases
and
those
with
cancer
who
got
COVID-19
vaccines
while
their
immune
system
was
suppressed
by
chemotherapy
.
“
It
wouldn
’
t
surprise
me
to
see
that
higher
doses
work
,
but
we
have
to
do
it
systematically
and
find
out
,
”
says
Deepali
Kumar
,
director
of
transplant
infectious
diseases
at
Toronto
General
Hospital.She
argues
that
clinical
trials
studying
third
doses
are
crucial
to
provide
clarity
on
ideal
timing
and
potential
risks
in
vulnerable
populations
.
One
of
her
concerns
is
whether
an
extra
dose
of
vaccine
,
which
revs
up
the
immune
system
,
could
induce
rejection
of
a
donated
organ
;
in
Segev
’
s
study
,
a
heart
transplant
patient
had
a
mild
rejection
episode
1
week
after
her
third
dose
,
though
doctors
can
’
t
say
whether
it
was
linked
to
the
additional
dose
.
She
recovered
without
incident.Kumar
expects
results
in
July
from
a
clinical
trial
she
’
s
running
in
120
transplant
patients
,
only
about
one-third
of
whom
had
any
antibodies
after
two
doses
of
Moderna
’
s
vaccine
.
The
trial
provided
one-half
of
all
participants
a
third
dose
2
months
after
their
second
shot
,
and
the
rest
got
a
placebo
injection.In
Germany
,
11
centers
running
a
COVID-19
vaccine
study
are
recruiting
volunteers
with
a
range
of
conditions
that
,
by
their
nature
or
because
of
their
medications
,
can
affect
immune
functioning
,
including
people
with
transplanted
organ
or
autoimmune
diseases
,
and
those
on
kidney
dialysis
.
Researchers
will
study
antibodies
and
T
cells
after
the
second
dose
of
vaccine
,
and
may
eventually
offer
some
participants
a
third
vaccine
dose
,
says
Leif
Erik
Sander
,
an
infectious
disease
expert
at
the
Charité
University
Hospital
in
Berlin
,
who
is
helping
lead
the
work
.
And
Segev
is
in
discussions
with
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
to
start
a
trial
this
summer
in
transplant
patients
.
“
We
have
a
strong
biologic
rationale
for
a
third
dose
in
specific
populations
,
”
says
Ravi
Parikh
,
a
health
policy
researcher
and
medical
oncologist
at
the
University
of
Pennsylvania
.
His
patients
haven
’
t
asked
him
yet
about
third
doses
,
but
he
imagines
himself
supporting
that
strategy
for
some.When
it
comes
to
people
with
cancer
,
Parikh
is
not
deeply
worried
about
the
effectiveness
of
two
doses
.
Last
month
,
a
study
in
JAMA
Oncology
reported
that
90
%
of
a
group
of
cancer
patients
on
chemotherapy
and
other
drugs
produced
antibodies
after
two
doses
of
Pfizer
’
s
mRNA
vaccine
.
(
Parikh
co-wrote
a
commentary
accompanying
that
paper
.
)
Another
study
in
Cancer
Cell
this
month
reported
that
94
%
of
200
cancer
patients
had
antibodies
after
vaccination
.
Those
numbers
are
“
excellent
news
,
”
says
Salomon
Stemmer
,
a
medical
oncologist
at
Rabin
Medical
Center
who
led
the
JAMA
Oncology
study.But
in
Stemmer
’
s
cohort
of
102
patients
on
treatment
,
antibody
levels
were
between
one-quarter
and
one-third
of
their
healthy
family
members
’
after
they
got
a
vaccine
.
The
difference
doesn
’
t
strongly
concern
Stemmer
,
but
because
the
level
of
SARS-CoV-2
antibodies
declines
naturally
over
time
,
he
wonders
whether
they
may
drop
worryingly
low
in
cancer
patients
sooner
,
because
they
start
from
a
lower
level
.
Parikh
agrees
this
is
a
big
question
:
“
We
don
’
t
know
how
quickly
these
antibody
titers
are
going
to
fall
,
”
he
says.Stemmer
is
continuing
to
follow
his
cohort
and
plans
to
test
antibody
levels
every
2
to
3
months
.
He
also
wants
to
learn
more
about
the
small
group
of
patients
that
produced
no
antibodies
to
SARS-CoV-2
at
all
:
They
include
three
women
with
breast
cancer
getting
“
dose-dense
”
chemotherapy
,
which
means
less
time
between
treatments
.
Third
vaccine
doses
might
be
helpful
in
some
cases
,
but
Stemmer
says
he
would
only
offer
them
as
part
of
a
clinical
trial.Segev
hopes
more
information
to
help
these
populations
will
come
soon
.
Right
now
,
he
acknowledges
,
“
There
is
a
lack
of
guidance
and
a
lack
of
knowledge.
”
In
the
meantime
,
Segev
recognizes
that
some
people
may
prefer
to
take
matters
into
their
own
hands
,
whereas
others
would
eagerly
join
a
clinical
trial—though
he
urges
anyone
considering
a
third
vaccine
dose
to
speak
to
their
doctor
first
.
“
Whatever
is
happening
out
there
,
we
are
going
to
learn
from
as
much
as
we
possibly
can
,
”
he
says
.

’
s
COVID-19
reporting
is
supported
by
the
Heising-Simons
Foundation.Despite
safety
concerns
,
the
Brazilian
Health
Regulatory
Agency
(
Anvisa
)
reversed
itself
last
week
and
voted
to
allow
a
trickle
of
Sputnik
V
,
the
Russian-made
COVID-19
vaccine
,
into
the
country
.
Only
928,000
doses
will
be
imported—just
a
fraction
of
the
total
requested
by
a
group
of
state
governors—and
the
agency
imposed
stringent
measures
to
reduce
supposed
health
risks
and
monitor
the
vaccine
’
s
safety
and
efficacy.In
April
,
with
Brazil
facing
a
massive
COVID-19
surge
and
a
scarcity
of
vaccine
,
Anvisa
vetoed
a
previous
import
request
,
citing
concerns
that
the
vaccine
contains
adenoviruses
that
could
replicate
and
harm
vaccinated
people
.
The
decision
sparked
a
lawsuit
threat
by
Sputnik
V
’
s
manufacturer
,
the
Gamaleya
Research
Institute
of
Epidemiology
and
Microbiology
,
and
drew
criticism
from
some
scientists
.
But
on
4
June
,
four
of
Anvisa
’
s
five
directors
decided
to
allow
the
importation
of
Sputnik
V
,
swayed
by
a
new
law
and
Brazil
’
s
continuing
,
worsening
crisis
.
“
The
health
context
that
our
country
is
going
through
makes
us
face
the
need
to
make
the
greatest
number
of
vaccines
and
medicines
available
,
”
said
Alex
Machado
,
one
of
the
four
directors
.
Brazil
has
one
of
the
world
’
s
highest
burdens
of
COVID-19
but
has
only
vaccinated
about
15
%
of
its
people
with
a
first
dose.Sputnik
V
’
s
two
doses
use
two
different
adenoviruses
to
deliver
genes
encoding
the
spike
protein
in
the
pandemic
coronavirus
SARS-CoV-2
.
The
adenoviruses
are
supposed
to
be
unable
to
make
copies
of
themselves
.
But
Anvisa
’
s
general
manager
of
medicines
and
biological
products
,
Gustavo
Mendes
,
says
the
latest
documents
the
agency
received
,
describing
analyses
performed
by
the
Russian
health
minister
,
put
the
number
of
replication-competent
adenoviruses
at
“
not
more
than
50
per
dose.
”
That
’
s
fewer
than
earlier
documentation
suggested
,
but
still
“
not
acceptable
,
”
he
adds
.
“
It
is
not
clear
for
us
what
was
the
rationale
used
to
approve
this
specification
nor
how
the
presence
of
these
viruses
can
be
safe.
”
Some
scientists
outside
the
fray
have
previously
said
Anvisa
is
misreading
such
Russian
documentation
.
They
argue
it
does
not
indicate
the
presence
of
live
virus
,
but
rather
the
detection
limits
of
tests
for
such
virus.According
to
a
Brazilian
law
enacted
in
March
,
the
country
can
selectively
import
vaccines
already
approved
for
emergency
use
by
certain
countries—including
Russia
.
So
Anvisa
staffers
and
the
governors
had
several
meetings
to
discuss
ways
to
get
out
the
shots
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
“
minimize
risks
”
associated
with
the
vaccine
,
Mendes
says.Anvisa
has
for
now
restricted
Sputnik
V
imports
to
a
number
sufficient
to
cover
only
1
%
of
the
population
of
the
six
northern
states
that
filed
the
original
vaccine
request
,
which
called
for
67
million
doses
.
The
batches
will
have
to
undergo
analysis
by
a
state-owned
lab
to
show
they
are
safe
and
do
not
contain
replicant
adenoviruses
,
and
only
healthy
adults
will
be
eligible
for
the
shots.Moreover
,
the
states
administering
the
vaccine
must
disclose
to
the
population
that
the
regulatory
agency
did
not
clear
the
products
for
quality
,
safety
,
or
efficacy
.
And
in
a
step
proposed
by
the
Brazilian
governors
,
the
states
will
have
to
conduct
a
Sputnik
V
efficacy
study
under
Anvisa
’
s
supervision.
“
It
was
a
victory
for
us
,
and
we
are
going
to
work
together
to
follow
all
the
conditions
,
”
says
Sergio
Rezende
,
Brazil
’
s
former
science
minister
,
who
is
part
of
the
scientific
board
supporting
the
governors
who
requested
the
vaccine
.
Rezende
maintains
that
Anvisa
originally
vetoed
the
import
for
political
reasons
,
as
Brazilian
President
Jair
Bolsonaro
has
criticized
COVID-19
vaccines
,
especially
those
manufactured
by
“
communist
countries
,
”
such
as
China
and
Russia.Sputnik
V
’
s
temporary
use
permit
can
be
suspended
at
any
time
if
either
Anvisa
or
the
World
Health
Organization
denies
it
a
formal
emergency
use
authorization
(
still
under
evaluation
in
Brazil
)
,
or
if
any
issues
arise
during
the
laboratory
tests
or
vaccination
.
There
is
no
prediction
of
when
the
approved
doses
will
arrive
,
but
Brazilian
governors
,
Anvisa
,
and
the
manufacturer
are
already
discussing
the
vaccination
rollout.For
the
immunologist
Jorge
Kalil
,
a
vaccine
expert
at
the
Federal
University
of
São
Paulo
’
s
main
campus
,
Anvisa
’
s
compromise
was
a
clever
strategy
.
“
We
are
not
in
a
position
to
discard
vaccines
,
and
that
was
a
good
solution
to
see
if
,
effectively
,
under
Brazilian
eyes
,
this
vaccine
works
well
and
can
be
distributed
to
the
whole
population

’
s
COVID-19
reporting
is
supported
by
the
Heising-Simons
Foundation.The
dark
horse
vaccine
company
Novavax
announced
strong
results
today
from
a
pivotal
,
30,000-person
trial
of
its
pandemic
coronavirus
vaccine
in
the
United
States
and
Mexico
.
The
vaccine
uses
a
protein
of
SARS-CoV-2
,
a
different
technology
from
the
COVID-19
vaccines
authorized
so
far
,
and
delivered
90.4
%
overall
efficacy
against
symptomatic
COVID-19
infections
,
and
100
%
protection
against
moderate
and
severe
disease
.
Against
eight
viral
variants
of
interest
and
concern
,
its
efficacy
was
93.2
%
.
And
the
vaccine
appeared
safe
and
well-tolerated.
“
This
vaccine
looks
phenomenal
.
I
am
thrilled
about
these
results
,
”
says
Monica
Gandhi
,
an
infectious
disease
physician
and
epidemiologist
at
the
University
of
California
,
San
Francisco
.
She
notes
that
the
clinical
trial
was
highly
diverse
,
with
44
%
nonwhite
participants
,
and
that
the
vaccine
’
s
straightforward
storage
requirements
could
speed
access
to
it
in
remote
communities
around
the
globe.The
difference
of
a
few
percentage
points
between
Novavax
’
s
90
%
efficacy
and
the
95
%
and
94
%
efficacy
of
the
Pfizer-BioNTech
and
Moderna
vaccines
is
explained
in
part
by
Novavax
’
s
later
trial
,
which
pitted
the
vaccine
against
viral
variants
,
says
John
Moore
,
an
immunologist
at
Weill
Cornell
Medicine
and
a
participant
in
the
Novavax
trial
.
The
trials
of
those
other
companies
’
vaccines
,
composed
of
messenger
RNA
(
mRNA
)
,
were
completed
before
such
variants
were
widely
circulating.
“
This
is
a
vaccine
whose
efficacy
is
at
least
on
a
par
with
Pfizer
and
Moderna
,
”
Moore
says
.
“
It
’
s
essentially
100
%
protective
against
disease.
”
One
expert
is
less
impressed
,
however
.
“
The
data
they
have
[
are
]
nothing
spectacular
,
”
says
Vijay
Samant
,
CEO
of
Xiconic
Pharmaceuticals
and
former
chief
operating
officer
of
Merck
’
s
vaccine
division
.
“
The
efficacy
overall
is
couple
of
notches
below
the
Pfizer
and
Moderna
studies
.
…
It
’
s
a
me-too
vaccine
at
best.
”
Novavax
plans
to
apply
to
the
U.S.
Food
and
Drug
Administration
and
other
regulators
for
an
emergency
use
authorization
in
the
third
quarter
,
once
the
company
completes
regulatory
requirements
aimed
at
ensuring
its
product
consistently
matches
the
vaccine
used
in
the
clinical
trials
,
said
President
and
CEO
Stanley
Erck.Today
’
s
announcement
marks
the
end
of
a
very
long
beginning
for
the
once-moribund
Gaithersburg
,
Maryland
,
company
,
which
began
to
develop
a
vaccine
in
January
2020
and
that
July
won
$
1.6
billion
from
the
U.S.
government
’
s
Operation
Warp
Speed
.
But
the
company
encountered
production
problems
that
delayed
the
launch
of
its
North
American
clinical
trial
until
late
December
2020
.
In
the
trial
,
two-thirds
of
participants
at
113
sites
in
the
United
States
and
six
sites
in
Mexico
initially
received
two
doses
of
the
vaccine
separated
by
21
days
.
One-third
of
participants
received
a
placebo
.
Between
25
January
and
30
April
,
participants
experienced
77
cases
of
COVID-19
,
63
of
them
in
the
placebo
group
.
All
14
cases
in
vaccinated
participants
were
mild.These
results
are
similar
to
those
Novavax
reported
in
January
from
a
late-stage
trial
of
more
than
15,000
people
in
the
United
Kingdom
.
That
trial
showed
the
vaccine
efficacy
was
89
%
overall
,
86
%
against
the
Alpha
variant
that
was
first
identified
in
the
United
Kingdom
,
and
96
%
against
the
original
virus
strain
.
But
in
a
separate
trial
involving
4400
participants
in
South
Africa
,
where
the
worrisome
Beta
variant
arose
and
was
circulating
widely
,
the
vaccine
’
s
overall
efficacy
sank
to
49
%
.In
the
new
trial
,
Novavax
sequenced
70
%
of
all
the
coronaviruses
that
caused
illness
.
In
more
than
half
of
the
sequenced
cases
,
they
found
the
culprit
was
the
Alpha
variant
,
which
accounted
for
70
%
of
U.S.
infections
by
late
April
.
But
the
company
did
not
provide
specific
efficacy
data
against
Alpha
or
any
other
variant
.
(
Only
two
cases
of
the
Beta
variant
were
reported
in
the
trial
.
)
“
It
doesn
’
t
really
address
the
lingering
questions
about
how
well
the
vaccine
would
work
against
‘
escape
’
variants
”
such
as
Beta
,
says
Natalie
Dean
,
a
biostatistician
at
the
University
of
Florida.The
COVID-19
vaccines
so
far
authorized
by
major
Western
regulatory
agencies
deliver
genetic
material
that
directs
a
recipient
’
s
cells
to
make
spike
,
a
surface
protein
from
SARS-CoV-2
,
that
then
trains
the
immune
system
to
respond
to
the
virus
.
Novavax
’
s
vaccine
instead
delivers
the
spike
protein
itself
,
carried
on
soaplike
particles
and
given
extra
punch
by
an
immune-boosting
substance
called
an
adjuvant
.
Protein
technology
has
been
used
for
decades
in
vaccines
against
diseases
including
hepatitis
B.In
clinical
trials
so
far
,
Novavax
’
s
vaccine
has
produced
somewhat
fewer
powerful
,
though
transient
systemwide
side
effects
such
as
headache
,
muscle
pain
,
and
fatigue
,
which
many
recipients
of
the
Pfizer-BioNTech
and
Moderna
vaccines
experienced
.
For
instance
,
54
%
of
participants
who
received
Moderna
’
s
vaccine
as
part
of
a
30,000-person
trial
reported
at
least
one
such
effect
;
in
Novavax
’
s
15,000-person
trial
in
the
United
Kingdom
,
that
number
was
38
%
.After
a
second
dose
of
vaccine
in
the
North
American
Novavax
trial
,
about
40
%
of
participants
who
received
the
active
vaccine
reported
experiencing
some
degree
of
headache
,
muscle
pain
,
or
fatigue
.
But
serious
reactions
were
rare.Having
relatively
mild
side
effects
is
a
plus
,
says
Mayank
Mamtani
,
a
biotechnology
analyst
who
follows
Novavax
for
B.
Riley
Securities
.
“
This
Novavax
vaccine
is
going
to
be
less
reactogenic
.
You
don
’
t
have
to
cancel
all
your
meetings
”
afterward
,
he
says
.
He
adds
that
the
Novavax
jab
may
find
a
niche
as
a
booster
vaccine
in
the
United
States
,
where
he
says
such
boosters
may
be
needed
by
October
or
November
.
“
We
in
this
country
love
choice
,
”
he
adds
.
Under
its
2020
contract
with
Operation
Warp
Speed
,
Novavax
committed
to
deliver
110
million
doses
to
the
U.S.
government
,
although
the
country
does
not
need
them
for
initial
vaccinations
.
Novavax
expects
to
reach
manufacturing
capacity
of
100
million
doses
per
month
by
the
end
of
the
third
quarter
and
150
million
doses
per
month
by
the
fourth
quarter
of
this
year
,
Erck
said
.
The
company
has
advance-purchase
orders
for
about
200
million
doses
from
another
five
Western
governments
and
last
month
signed
a
deal
to
supply
Gavi
,
the
Vaccine
Alliance
,
with
350
million
doses
for
the
COVID-19
Vaccines
Global
Access
(
COVAX
)
Facility
,
a
global
vaccine-sharing
partnership
.
The
Serum
Institute
of
India
,
which
is
also
making
the
Novavax
vaccine
,
is
slated
to
deliver
another
750
million
doses
to
COVAX
,
Novavax
says
.
Serum
plans
to
start
delivering
the
Novavax
vaccine
by
September
,
provided
regulatory
agencies
have
authorized
it
,
officials
there
told
Science.Novavax
’
s
production
projections
are
substantially
dialed
back
from
earlier
company
predictions
that
it
would
ship
2
billion
doses
this
year
.
That
reflects
the
company
’
s
struggle
to
scale
up
its
manufacturing
both
at
its
own
facilities
and
those
of
contractors
and
partner
companies
in
11
nations
.
“
Novavax
has
been
particularly
challenged
with
executing
on
production
scale-up
efforts
and
manufacturing
,
”
Mamtani
wrote
in
a
note
to
investment
clients
last
month.Unlike
mRNA
vaccines
,
which
need
to
be
stored
frozen
,
Novavax
’
s
protein
vaccine
can
be
stored
in
a
refrigerator
for
up
to
6
months
,
and
,
once
removed
,
remains
viable
for
24
hours
.
Novavax
has
created
a
new
version
of
its
vaccine
,
adapted
to
the
Beta
variant
,
that
could
be
used
as
a
1-year
booster
,
the
company
says
.
On
Friday
,
it
announced
positive
results
for
the
adapted
vaccine
in
mice
and
baboons
.
Novavax
says
it
is
also
working
to
customize
its
vaccine
to
other
SARS-CoV-2
variants.But
Samant
cautions
that
Novavax
’
s
manufacturing
struggles
and
the
entrenched
advantages
of
companies
whose
vaccines
were
approved
months
ago
may
make
the
small

COVID-19
reporting
is
supported
by
the
Heising-Simons
Foundation.The
questions
are
urgent
,
and
the
funding
is
in
place
.
But
a
highly
anticipated
,
$
130
million
clinical
trial
,
meant
to
test
the
efficacy
of
the
novel
messenger
RNA
(
mRNA
)
vaccines
for
COVID-19
against
a
key
variant
of
the
pandemic
coronavirus
as
well
as
in
people
living
with
HIV
and
pregnant
women
,
is
stalled
.
It
is
ready
to
launch
in
eight
countries
in
sub-Saharan
Africa
,
yet
neither
maker
of
the
vaccines
,
Pfizer
and
Moderna
,
wants
to
participate—or
even
provide
their
vaccines.A
group
of
prominent
HIV
advocates
and
activists
in
South
Africa
has
written
a
letter
complaining
about
the
delay
to
U.S.
government
officials
,
including
Anthony
Fauci
,
director
of
the
National
Institute
of
Allergy
and
Infectious
Diseases
(
NIAID
)
,
which
agreed
to
pay
for
the
study
.
They
stress
that
COVID-19
strikes
people
living
with
HIV
especially
hard
,
and
that
dangerous
variants
of
SARS-CoV-2
evolve
in
them
because
many
have
weakened
immune
systems
.
“
We
believe
this
will
be
a
landmark
study
for
this
region
and
…
the
world
,
”
they
wrote
.
“
We
respectfully
ask
that
you
do
all
in
your
power
to
enable
this
study
to
take
place.
”
The
efficacy
trial
could
yield
answers
in
as
little
as
12
weeks
given
the
rapid
spread
of
SARS-CoV-2
in
the
region
.
“
This
is
the
most
important
yet-to-be-done
study
”
in
the
entire
portfolio
of
adult
COVID-19
vaccine
trials
funded
by
the
U.S.
government
to
date
,
says
Lawrence
Corey
of
the
Fred
Hutchinson
Cancer
Research
Center
who
helped
organize
the
trial.The
trial
aims
to
follow
up
on
hints
that
mRNA
vaccines
can
protect
against
a
coronavirus
variant
first
seen
in
South
Africa
,
originally
called
B.1.351
and
now
dubbed
Beta
under
the
World
Health
Organization
’
s
new
naming
system
.
The
variant
,
widely
prevalent
in
Africa
,
escapes
critical
antibody
responses
in
lab
studies
,
and
non-mRNA
vaccines
have
shown
lower
efficacy
against
it
(
see
table
,
below
)
.
Two
of
those
vaccines
,
from
Novavax
and
Johnson
&
Johnson
,
also
appeared
to
offer
only
modest
,
if
any
,
protection
in
people
with
HIV
.
“
We
have
a
real
problem
with
HIV-infected

”
says
Glenda
Gray
,
who
heads
the
South
African
Medical
Research
Council
,
the
study
’
s
sponsor
.
And
whether
current
COVID-19
vaccines
protect
pregnant
women
remains
uncertain
,
as
initial
efficacy
trials
excluded
them.The
new
trial
would
be
organized
by
the
COVID-19
Prevention
Network
(
CoVPN
)
,
which
Corey
co-leads
,
that
previously
staged
efficacy
trials
of
the
Moderna
vaccine
and
four
other
vaccine
candidates
that
were
part
of
the
U.S.
government
’
s
multibillion-dollar
Operation
Warp
Speed
program
.
Positive
results
would
strengthen
the
case
that
mRNA
vaccines
,
now
scarce
in
the
developing
world
,
should
be
more
widely
available
.
But
a
Pfizer
spokesperson
says
it
considers
the
study
unnecessary
because
evidence
shows
its
vaccine
works
well
against
the
Beta
variant
,
and
the
company
has
an
international
study
underway
in
pregnant
women.The
protection
offered
by
some
COVID-19
vaccines
may
be
compromised
in
Africa
because
a
variant
of
SARS-CoV-2
that
can
escape
key
antibody
responses
is
widespread
there
.
The
Pfizer
messenger
RNA
(
mRNA
)
vaccine
did
best
,
but
its
trial
was
small
.
(
*
Efficacy
measured
for
symptomatic
COVID-19
,
not
severe
disease
)
When
the
trial
designers
turned
to
Moderna
,
the
company
initially
said
it
would
provide
its
mRNA
vaccine
,
although
it
wanted
the
trial
to
compare
the
current
version
with
a
newer
version
under
development
.
Then
a
few
weeks
ago
,
just
as
the
trial
was
preparing
to
launch
,
Moderna
began
to
back
out
.
The
company
and
its
would-be
collaborators
say
a
complex
mix
of
liability
concerns
,
Moderna
's
reluctance
to
have
its
scientists
help
with
required
oversight
known
as
pharmacovigilance
,
and
concerns
about
the
design
of
the
study
led
to
the
change
of
heart.Some
of
the
trial
organizers
,
however
,
suspect
business
considerations
factor
in
,
too
:
Both
companies
may
be
wary
that
new
data
would
complicate
getting
full
approval
for
their
vaccines
from
regulatory
agencies
;
the
vaccines
have
received
only
an
emergency
use
authorization
in
the
United
States
and
other
countries.The
proposed
trial
would
involve
14,000
people
in
South
Africa
,
Botswana
,
Zimbabwe
,
Eswatini
,
Malawi
,
Zambia
,
Uganda
,
and
Kenya
,
where
adult
HIV
prevalence
ranges
from
4.5
%
to
27
%
.
Half
the
participants
in
the
study
,
dubbed
CoVPN
3008
,
would
receive
the
current
Moderna
vaccine
,
which
contains
mRNA
that
codes
for
the
surface
protein
,
spike
,
of
SARS-CoV-2
.
The
other
participants
initially
would
receive
placebo
shots
.
But
as
soon
as
clear
evidence
emerged
that
the
current
vaccine
protects
against
COVID-19
,
the
placebo
group
would
be
offered
a
new
“
bivalent
”
vaccine
Moderna
has
developed
.
It
contains
mRNA
for
the
original
spike
protein
as
well
as
mRNA
for
the
slightly
mutated
version
in
the
Beta
variant
.
Ethicists
have
long
debated
whether
vaccine
trial
participants
should
still
be
given
placebos
once
a
proven
product
exists
,
but
a
South
African
researcher
who
helped
design
the
study
notes
it
has
received
approvals
from
multiple
bodies
after
intensive
ethical
reviews
.
At
the
moment
,
says
Linda-Gail
Bekker
,
director
of
the
Desmond
Tutu
HIV
Centre
and
a
CoVPN
3008
investigator
,
“
There
is
no
vaccine
for
most
people
”
in
the
region
,
and
trial
participants
will
likely
receive
doses
earlier
than
they
would
otherwise
.
If
participants
do
become
eligible
for
any
authorized
COVID-19
vaccine
during
the
trial
,
they
will
be
encouraged
to
drop
out.Gray
is
surprised
that
Moderna
is
balking
.
NIAID
worked
closely
with
the
company
to
design
its
vaccine
,
and
Warp
Speed
gave
the
firm
$
1.5
billion
for
related
R
&
D
and
efficacy
trials
.
(
Pfizer
did
not
receive
government
support
to
develop
or
test
its
vaccine
.
)
“
This
is
a
request
from
the
U.S.
government
to
a
drug
company
to
help
answer
a
critical
question
,
”
Gray
says
.
“
It
just
seems
weird.
”
Moderna
,
however
,
says
it
wants
to
move
on
to
assessing
its
new
formulation
.
“
We
believe
science
and
public
health
will
be
better
served
by
investigating
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
a
multivalent
vaccine
which
includes
the
sequence
against
B.1.351
,
”
a
spokesperson
said
.
“
We
are
in
active
discussions
with
potential
investigators
in
Africa
to
conduct
such
a
study.
”
But
Gray
and
other
leaders
of
the
planned
study
say
the
company
also
expressed
concern
to
them
about
liability
for
vaccine
side
effects
and
staffing
the
required
pharmacovigilance
effort.The
case
for
the
new
trial
remains
strong
,
they
add
.
Tantalizing
results
from
a
South
African
trial
of
the
Pfizer
vaccine
suggested
mRNA
vaccines
might
work
well
against
the
Beta
variant
:
Only
nine
people
,
all
in
the
placebo
group
,
developed
symptomatic
COVID-19
among
the
800
participants
.
But
the
small
numbers
mean
the
finding
is
far
from
conclusive
.
A
bigger
study
is
critical
for
both
science
and
policy
,
Corey
says
.
“
Having
data
showing
the
efficacy
of
mRNA
in
this
region
provides
the
hard
facts
that
excluding
these
countries
from
access
[
to
this
type
of
vaccine
]
is
medically
inappropriate.
”
Trial
organizers
hope
a
deal
can
still
be
reached
with
Moderna
.
They
note
that
in
theory
,
the
U.S.
government
could
assume
liability
and
provide
the
trial
with
the
vaccine
.
A
U.S.
government
official
familiar
with
the
negotiations
says
the
hitch
is
the
Public
Readiness
and
Emergency
Preparedness
Act
,
which
indemnifies
COVID-19
vaccine
manufacturers
but
only
in
the
United
States
.
Amending
the
act
to
provide
international
indemnity
would
require
action
at
the
highest
government
levels
.
Alternatively
,
the
South
African
government
could
indemnify
the
company
,
and
Gray
says
such
negotiations
are
underway.If
the
mRNA
vaccine
trial
goes
forward
and
proves
that
the
current
Moderna
vaccine
works
against
the
Beta
variant
,
Gray
predicts
Moderna
and
Pfizer
will
still
move
forward
with
reformulated
vaccines
targeting
different
variants
as
well
as
the
original
virus
.
And
that
could
lead
to
a
windfall
for
the
African
continent
,
as
rich
countries
embrace
the
new
formulations
.
“
There
would
be
a
whole
lot
of
[
original
]
mRNA
vaccine
lying
around
that
nobody
wants
,
”
she
envisions
.
“
There
’
d
be
all
these
stashes
of
it
all
over
the
place
,
and
we
could
acquire
it
cheaper.

’
s
COVID-19
reporting
is
supported
by
the
Heising-Simons
Foundation.For
people
not
yet
vaccinated
against
COVID-19
or
still
nervous
about
venturing
into
crowds
,
the
sales
pitch
may
be
alluring
:
Drool
into
a
tube
to
provide
your
DNA
and
mail
it
off
to
see
how
likely
you
are
to
be
among
the
10
%
to
15
%
of
people
who
will
end
up
in
the
hospital
or
die
from
a
SARS-CoV-2
infection
.
That
’
s
the
promise
of
a
test
an
Australian
company
launched
last
week
in
the
United
States
.
It
combines
genetic
data
with
someone
’
s
age
,
sex
,
and
preexisting
medical
conditions
to
predict
their
risk
of
becoming
extremely
ill
from
COVID-19.The
$
175
test
is
based
on
genetic
markers
linked
to
severe
COVID-19
,
along
with
other
risk
factors
,
and
the
company
says
it
developed
its
predictions
using
data
on
thousands
of
COVID-19
patients
in
the
United
Kingdom
.
It
may
be
a
forerunner
of
similar
risk
tests
:
An
academic
team
has
recently
detailed
a
simpler
genetic
test
to
help
determine
how
aggressively
some
people
infected
with
SARS-CoV-2
should
be
treated.Yet
several
genetics
experts
tell
Science
that
how
a
person
’
s
genes
influence
the
course
of
COVID-19
remains
too
murky
to
deploy
such
risk
assessments
.
“
I
think
it
’
s
premature
to
use
a
genetic
test
to
predict
a
person
’
s
likely
COVID-19
severity
.
We
don
’
t
understand
exactly
what
these
genetic
variants
mean
or
how
they
affect
disease
,
”
says
genetic
epidemiologist
Priya
Duggal
of
Johns
Hopkins
University
.
She
doesn
’
t
think
clinicians
would
change
how
they
treat
an
infected
person
based
on
these
tests
.
And
she
hopes
unvaccinated
people
would
not
adopt
riskier
behavior
if
the
company
’
s
test
suggests
they
are
less
vulnerable
to
COVID-19.Duggal
and
others
also
say
the
company
’
s
test
might
be
pointless
at
a
time
when
most
people
in
the
United
States
can
get
a
highly
effective
COVID-19
vaccine—or
even
a
disincentive
for
some
to
get
a
shot
.
Richard
Allman
,
chief
scientific
officer
for
the
company
behind
the
test
,
Melbourne-based
Genetic
Technologies
,
says
people
should
heed
public
messaging
to
be
vaccinated
,
but
adds
that
the
test
could
be
useful
before
immunity
develops
and
later
,
after
it
wanes.Genetic
Technologies
,
which
previously
focused
on
at-home
cancer
risk
tests
,
developed
the
test
by
drawing
on
studies
combing
the
DNA
of
thousands
of
COVID-19
patients
for
genetic
variants
that
could
help
explain
how
sick
they
got
.
The
variants
might
influence
a
person
’
s
resistance
to
the
virus
,
for
example
,
or
their
susceptibility
to
a
deadly
immune
overreaction
.
A
global
data-pooling
effort
called
the
COVID-19
Host
Genetics
Initiative
has
found
tentative
links
between
dozens
of
common
genetic
markers
,
DNA
base
differences
called
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
(
SNPs
)
,
and
a
higher
risk
that
an
infected
person
will
develop
severe
COVID-19—anywhere
from
a
doubling
of
the
risk
to
small
increases
,
say
from
15
%
risk
to
16
%
.Seven
SNPs
unearthed
by
the
initiative
form
the
basis
of
the
new
test
.
To
narrow
in
on
them
from
a
larger
list
of
candidates
,
the
developers
at
Genetic
Technologies
turned
to
data
from
the
UK
Biobank
,
a
research
database
of
mostly
white
U.K.
residents
currently
age
50
to
84
who
have
provided
medical
information
and
had
their
DNA
analyzed
for
thousands
of
known
SNPS
.
The
company
compared
about
2200
UK
Biobank
participants
who
had
been
hospitalized
for
COVID-19
with
5400
who
also
had
the
virus
but
ended
up
with
mild
symptoms
or
no
illness
.
It
combined
information
on
their
SNPs
with
other
risk
factors
,
such
as
being
old
,
male
,
obese
,
or
diabetic.The
result
was
a
“
substantial
improvement
”
in
predictive
power
over
using
age
and
sex
alone
,
the
company
concluded
in
a
preprint
posted
in
March
.
Whereas
the
average
risk
of
severe
disease
from
the
coronavirus
for
a
person
50
or
older
is
27
%
,
it
’
s
as
low
as
4
%
for
some
people
over
age
50
,
the
company
’
s
model
suggests
.
For
others
,
says
Genetic
Technologies
biostatistician
and
first
author
Gillian
Dite
,
the
risk
is
“
really
,
really
high
”
—as
much
as
98
%
,
meaning
an
unvaccinated
person
infected
by
SARS-CoV-2
is
almost
guaranteed
to
develop
severe
COVID-19.Infinity
BiologiX
(
IBX
)
,
Genetic
Technologies
’
s
U.S.
partner
,
is
now
offering
the
test
to
adults
ages
18
and
up
.
“
By
understanding
who
among
us
are
at
greater
risk
for
developing
severe
disease
,
we
can
be
more
thoughtful
about
safety
protocols
,
and
personal
risks
that
we
are
willing
to
take
for
ourselves
and
our
loved
ones
,
”
the
company
explains
on
IBX
’
s
website
.
Even
with
vaccines
rolling
out
,
“
corporate
entities
would
find
this
a
valuable
tool
”
for
prioritizing
who
among
those
not
yet
vaccinated
could
come
back
to
the
workplace
,
Allman
says.The
test
debuts
in
a
regulatory
gray
zone
,
however
.
The
two
companies
did
not
seek
U.S.
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(
FDA
)
approval
for
validity
because
,
Allman
says
,
the
test
is
not
a
direct-to-consumer
product
that
falls
under
its
review
.
After
a
customer
receives
results
from
IBX
’
s
federally
approved
labs
,
they
can
consult
with
a
“
telehealth
”
physician
.
But
FDA
has
sometimes
exerted
authority
over
consumer-ordered
genetic
risk
tests
,
such
as
several
from
the
personal
genomics
company
23
&
Me
.
(
FDA
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
.
)
Several
geneticists
who
reviewed
the
company
’
s
preprint
told
Science
the
test
needs
to
be
validated
in
other
,
more
diverse
populations
than
one
detailed
in
the
UK
Biobank
,
and
they
wonder
whether
its
predictions
are
reliable
for
people
infected
with
new
SARS-CoV-2
variants
.
“
It
’
s
a
good
start
,
but
by
no
means
is
it
calibrated
or
validated
sufficiently
to
say
this
is
a
test
I
would
take
or
my
wife
should
take
,
”
says
cancer
geneticist
Stephen
Chanock
of
the
U.S.
National
Cancer
Institute
,
who
knows
of
other
companies
working
on
a
similar
test.Dite
says
it
has
been
difficult
to
find
large
data
sets
with
clinical
information
on
COVID-19
patients
.
Her
company
decided
to
go
ahead
,
she
adds
,
“
because
we
do
not
know
when
further
validation
will
be
possible
,
and
because
of
the
importance
of
a
rapid
response
to
the
ongoing
pandemic.
”
The
test
asks
whether
someone
is
of
non-European
ancestry
,
which
data
suggest
increases
the
risk
of
severe
COVID-19
,
so
Dite
believes
it
is
relevant
for
U.S.
minorities.Some
members
of
the
COVID-19
Host
Genetics
Initiative
have
proposed
using
just
a
single
SNP
on
chromosome
3
to
predict
the
risk
of
severe
disease
in
infected
people
under
age
60
who
seek
medical
care
;
having
one
copy
of
this
SNP
elevates
a
person
’
s
risk
2.6-fold
,
they
report
in
a
preprint
posted
in
March
.
(
The
authors
declined
to
discuss
the
study
until
it
’
s
published
in
a
journal
.
)
The
study
is
“
well-designed
,
”
says
Massachusetts
General
Hospital
physician-scientist
Amit
Khera
,
who
combines
SNPs
into
polygenic
risk
scores
that
try
to
assess
a
person
’
s
chances
of
developing
common
diseases
.
Yet
that
doesn
’
t
mean
a
chromosome
3
SNP
test
will
quickly
find
medical
use
,
Khera
adds
.
“
There
are
almost
no
examples
”
of
doctors
or
emergency
room
staff
giving
patients
a
rapid
genetic
test
to
guide
treatment
,
he
notes
.
“
I
don
’
t
think
it
’
s
very
likely
to
be
implemented
into
practice.
”
Still
,
many
geneticists
,
including
Chanock
,
who
’
s
looking
for
genetic
risk
factors
for
COVID-19
himself
,
believe
such
tools
are
worth
developing
.
But
,
Chanock
notes
:
“
How
and
in
what
way
a
test
like
this
is
going
to
be
useful
is
still
very
much
an
open
question.

town
surrounded
by
sugarcane
fields

Brazil
,
one
of
the
countries
hardest
hit
by

,
has
shown
that
even
a

that
had
low

in

can
dramatically
control

part
of
an
unusual

to
track
the
real-world

of

,
a

made
by
a
Chinese
company
,
almost
all

,
in

received

between
February
and

,
long
before
most
would
otherwise

The
results
were
dramatic
.
Symptomatic
cases

have
dropped
by
80
%
since
the
start
of
mass
vaccination
,
related
hospitalizations
fell
86
%
,
and
deaths
plummeted
95
%
,
the
research
team
in
charge
of
the
experiment
reported
during
a
press
conference
yesterday.Meanwhile
,
cases
have
risen
out
of
control
in
15
other
cities
nearby
.
“
Serrana
is
now
an
oasis
,
”
says
Ricardo
Palacios
,
an
epidemiologist
at
the
Butantan
Institute
,
a
state-owned
research
center
that
produces
the
vaccine
in
Brazil
.
“
And
it
has
shown
us
that
it
is
surely
possible
to
control
the
epidemic
through
vaccination.
”
Some
other
COVID-19
vaccines
have
demonstrated
greater
than
90
%
real-world
effectiveness
at
preventing
serious
disease
,
and
they
have
helped
countries
bring
cases
down
to
very
low
levels
.
But
there
has
been
concern
about
CoronaVac
,
which
uses
an
inactivated
copy
of
SARS-CoV-2
to
stimulate
immunity
.
Clinical
trials
conducted
in
several
countries
came
up
with
different
efficacy
values
for
the
vaccine
,
the
lowest
being
50
%
in
Brazil—right
at
the
threshold
established
by
the
World
Health
Organization
(
WHO
)
for
emergency
use
of
a
COVID-19
vaccine
.
Later
studies
in
Brazil
that
tried
to
assess
the
vaccine
’
s
real-world
effectiveness
have
indicated
similar
levels
of
protection.That
’
s
why
the
data
from
Serrana
are
reassuring
to
many
scientists
in
Brazil
,
where
CoronaVac
makes
up
80
%
of
all
vaccine
doses
administered
.
“
These
are
very
encouraging
results
,
”
says
Ethel
Maciel
,
an
epidemiologist
at
the
Federal
University
of
Espírito
Santo
,
Vitória
,
who
was
not
part
of
the
study
.
Maciel
is
especially
relieved
the
vaccine
protected
the
town
because
a
SARS-CoV-2
variant
dubbed
P1
,
which
originated
in
Brazil
and
is
now
the
most
prevalent
in
the
country
,
was
also
the
most
common
variant
in
Serrana
during
the
period
of
the
study
.
Lab
studies
had
suggested
P1
,
which
WHO
recently
proposed
renaming
delta
,
could
elude
protection
from
vaccines.WHO
announced
today
that
it
granted
CoronaVac
an
emergency
use
listing
,
a
step
that
should
speed
the
vaccine
’
s
use
in
many
low-income
countries
.
Brazil
has
the
world
’
s
second
deadliest
COVID-19
outbreak
,
with
more
than
461,000
deaths
officially
,
below
the
United
States
but
ahead
of
India
.
Brazil
’
s
vaccination
campaign
,
slow
to
get
off
the
ground
because
of
scarce
vaccine
supplies
,
is
still
only
targeting
the
elderly
and
patients
with
comorbidities
.
Only
15
%
of
the
population
has
had
at
least
one
vaccine
dose.The
mass
vaccination
experiment
in
Serrana
was
named
Project
S—not
for
the
town
,
but
for
“
secret
,
”
as
the
plans
were
initially
kept
quiet
to
avoid
a
massive
migration
to
the
town
.
When
it
began
,
one
in
20
Serrana
residents
was
infected
,
and
more
than
25
%
had
been
previously
exposed
to
the
virus
.
The
high
caseload
made
the
town
attractive
as
a
test
site
,
along
with
its
modest
population
of
just
over
45,000
people
and
its
proximity
to
a
campus
of
the
University
of
São
Paulo.The
team
of
about
15
researchers
,
supported
by
local
authorities
and
health
professionals
,
first
conducted
a
detailed
census
.
Then
they
divided
Serrana
into
25
sections
that
represented
microcosms
of
people
who
interact
with
each
other—for
example
,
residents
living
in
the
same
group
of
buildings
or
shopping
in
the
same
stores
.
The
researchers
then
assembled
four
groups
of
residents
from
these
clusters
and
started
to
vaccinate
each
group
1
week
apart
,
administering
second
doses
4
weeks
after
the
first
.
Only
residents
18
years
and
older
who
weren
’
t
suffering
from
chronic
diseases
and
not
pregnant
were
eligible
.
After
8
weeks
,
96
%
of
those
,
about
27,000
in
total
,
had
received
two
shots.Although
the
town
was
never
closed
or
isolated
from
neighboring
cities
,
the
researchers
say
they
started
to
see
a
reduction
in
transmission
almost
immediately
after
the
first
group
got
its
second
dose
.
By
the
time
the
third
group
received
its
second
dose
,
and
about
75
%
of
the
eligible
population
was
immunized
,
the
outbreak
was
effectively
under
control.The
researchers
suggest
the
vaccination
campaign
,
combined
with
the
population
’
s
previous
infections
,
may
have
gotten
the
town
to
“
herd
immunity
,
”
the
point
at
which
the
coronavirus
has
difficulty
finding
new
people
to
infect
because
so
many
are
already
immune
.
On
day
14
after
the
last
vaccination
,
there
were
only
two
cases
among
vaccinated
people
and
no
deaths
.
“
It
was
amazing
,
”
Palacios
says
.
COVID-19
cases
,
hospitalizations
,
and
deaths
also
plummeted
among
children
and
teenagers
,
none
of
whom
received
the
vaccine.No
severe
side
effects
were
reported
.
The
team
says
the
results
will
soon
be
submitted
to
a
journal
for
publication
and
it
may
post
a
preprint
before
that
.
Florian
Krammer
,
a
virologist
at
the
Icahn
School
of
Medicine
at
Mount
Sinai
,
says
the
experiment
“
sounds
interesting
and
the
outcome
makes
sense
,
”
but
cautions
that
further
data
from
a
published
study
are
necessary
to
draw
conclusions.Ricardo
Gazzinelli
,
president
of
the
Brazilian
Immunology
Society
,
says
the
results
are
good
news
for
CoronaVac
,
but
cautions
that
2
months
of
analysis
is
too
short
.
The
research
team
plans
to
track
Serrana
’
s
residents
for
up
to
1
year
to
see
whether
their
immunity
wanes
.
If
it
does
so
quickly
,
ending
the
pandemic
using
CoronaVac
might
be
hard
,
because
Brazil
would
probably
need
to
start
giving
booster
shots
even
before
it
has
fully
vaccinated
the
entire
population.
“
If
the
vaccine
’
s
efficacy
period
is
short
and
we
keep
the
current
pace
of
vaccination
,
herd
immunity
will
never
be
reached
because
when
most
of
the
population
is
vaccinated
,
a
large
group
won
’
t
be
immune
anymore
,

Gazzinelli

’
s
COVID-19
reporting
is
supported
by
the
Heising-Simons
Foundation.The
COVID-19
vaccine
made
by
Pfizer
and
BioNTech
appears
to
put
young
men
at
elevated
risk
of
developing
a
heart
muscle
inflammation
called
myocarditis
,
researchers
in
Israel
say
.
In
a
report
submitted
today
to
the
Israeli
Ministry
of
Health
,
they
conclude
that
between
one
in
3000
and
one
in
6000
men
ages
16
to
24
who
received
the
vaccine
developed
the
rare
condition
.
But
most
cases
were
mild
and
resolved
within
a
few
weeks
,
which
is
typical
for
myocarditis
.
“
I
can
’
t
imagine
it
’
s
going
to
be
anything
that
would
cause
medical
people
to
say
we
shouldn
’
t
vaccinate
kids
,
”
says
Douglas
Diekema
,
a
pediatrician
and
bioethicist
at
Seattle
Children
’
s
Hospital.Israeli
health
officials
first
flagged
the
issue
in
April
,
when
they
reported
more
than
60
cases
,
mostly
in
young
men
who
had
received
their
second
dose
of
vaccine
a
few
days
earlier
.
Around
the
same
time
,
the
U.S.
Department
of
Defense
began
to
track
14
such
cases
.
In
mid-May
,
the
U.S.
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
said
it
,
too
,
was
reviewing
myocarditis
cases
.
Officials
at
the
European
Medicines
Agency
said
on
28
May
they
had
received
107
reports
of
myocarditis
following
the
Pfizer-BioNTech
vaccine
,
or
about
one
in
175,000
doses
administered
.
But
relatively
few
people
under
age
30
have
been
vaccinated
in
Europe.The
Israeli
panel
’
s
findings
come
as
Israel
and
many
European
countries
are
debating
whether
younger
adolescents
should
be
vaccinated
against
COVID-19
.
Israel
has
been
vaccinating
teenagers
16
and
older
since
late​
January
,
and
the
Ministry
of
Health
is
scheduled
to
announce
tomorrow
whether
vaccinations
will
be
opened
to
children
12
and
older
.
Other
countries
,
including
the
United
States
and
Canada
,
began
vaccinating
children
12
and
older
in
mid-May.
“
From
a
parent
’
s
perspective
,
this
really
comes
down
to
risk
perception
,
assessment
of
the
data
,
”
says
Diekema
,
who
has
studied
risk-benefit
trade-offs
.
Even
if
a
link
between
myocarditis
and
the
vaccine
holds
up
,
the
condition
is
usually
mild
,
requiring
treatment
only
with
anti-inflammatory
drugs
,
whereas
COVID-19
infection
can
also
cause
serious
disease
and
long-term
side
effects
,
even
in
young
people
.
As
suspicion
has
percolated
about
a
possible
connection
,
“
I
don
’
t
know
many
physicians
who
are
changing
their
minds
about
vaccinating
their
kids
,
”
Diekema
says.In
Israel
,
which
relied
almost
exclusively
on
the
Pfizer-BioNTech
vaccine
in
its
early
and
fast
vaccination
drive
,
the
Ministry
of
Health
in
January
assembled
a
panel
led
by
Dror
Mevorach
,
head
of
internal
medicine
at
the
Hadassah
University
Medical
Center
,
to
investigate
the
issue
.
Mevorach
tells
Science
he
and
his
colleagues
identified
110
myocarditis
cases
among
5
million
people
in
Israel
who
had
received
two
doses
of
the
Pfizer-BioNTech
vaccine
in
the
month
before
their
diagnosis
.
That
translates
to
about
one
in
50,000
vaccine
recipients
,
a
number
that
isn
’
t
concerning
given
the
background
rate
of
myocarditis
in
the
general
population
,
where
it
is
typically
triggered
by
viral
or
bacterial
infections
,
including
COVID-19
.
But
the
rate
of
myocarditis
following
vaccination
among
young
men
was
higher
.
Ninety
percent
of
the
cases
picked
up
in
Israel
appeared
in
men
,
and
although
myocarditis
is
normally
more
common
among
young
men
,
the
rate
among
those
vaccinated
was
somewhere
between
five
and
25
times
the
background
rate
,
the
report
says
.
(
Two
cases
of
fatal
myocarditis
have
also
been
reported
in
Israel
,
but
the
panel
says
investigations
of
those
deaths
were
inconclusive
;
one
patient
may
have
had
a
more
generalized
inflammatory
syndrome
,
and
the
other
diagnosis
was
``
not
verified
,
''
the
report
says
.
)
The
new
analysis
“
is
very
suggestive
of
a
causal
nature
,
”
between
the
vaccine
and
myocarditis
,
Mevorach
says
.
“
I
am
convinced
there
is
a
relationship.
”
“
It
does
suggest
that
this
is
,
at
least
statistically
,
a
real
phenomenon
,
”
says
Peter
Liu
,
a
cardiologist
and
chief
scientific
officer
of
the
University
of
Ottawa
Heart
Institute
.
Diekema
says
it
’
s
important
to
investigate
“
even
a
hint
of
a
signal
,
”
but
cautions
that
“
while
this
report
is
suggestive
…
it
requires
validation
in
other
populations
by
other
investigators
before
we
can
be
certain
the
link
exists.
”
Other
factors
may
be
in
play
,
Diekema
says
.
Now
that
children
are
back
to
socializing
and
playing
sports
,
his
hospital
’
s
emergency
room
is
“
seeing
more
viral
diseases
than
we
’
ve
seen
in
a
year
,
”
and
as
a
result
,
“
I
would
expect
to
see
a
little
bump
in
myocarditis
versus
a
year
ago.
”
Ideally
,
scientists
should
compare
cohorts
of
vaccinated
and
unvaccinated
youngsters
at
the
same
time
,
Diekema
says
,
and
he
’
s
heartened
that
such
studies
are
now
gearing
up.Myocarditis
cases
following
the
Moderna
vaccine
,
which
isn
’
t
in
use
in
Israel
,
are
also
being
investigated
in
the
United
States
.
It
’
s
not
clear
why
the
two
vaccines
,
which
both
rely
on
messenger
RNA
(
mRNA
)
,
might
heighten
the
risk
.
One
possibility
is
that
the
very
high
antibody
levels
that
both
generate
in
young
people
may
also
,
in
rare
cases
,
lead
to
a
sort
of
immune
overreaction
that
inflames
the
heart
.
“
There
’
s
no
question
these
[
vaccines
]
are
extremely
immune-generating
,
”
Liu
says
.
Mevorach
says
he
suspects
the
mRNA
itself
might
be
playing
a
role
.
The
innate
immune
system
recognizes
RNA
as
part
of
the
body
’
s
defense
against
microbes—including
RNA
viruses
like
SARS-CoV-2
,
he
notes
.
“
I
think
that
actually
the
mRNA
is
a
kind
of
natural
adjuvant
,
”
which
ramps
up
the
immune
response
,
he
says.Diekema
says
the
medical
community
is
now
on
alert
for
youngsters
with
chest
pain
and
other
symptoms
soon
after
vaccination—allowing
them
to
be
quickly
identified
,
treated
,
and
reported
to
health
departments
.
Mevorach
agrees
that
awareness
among
vaccinees
,
their
parents
,
and
their
doctors
is
important
for
prompt
and
effective
treatment
.
He
says
he
and
his
colleagues
treated
about
40
cases
.
Only
a
few
needed
corticosteroids
,
he
said
,
and
most
have
recovered
fully.One
important
question
is
whether
delaying
the
second
vaccine
dose
might
reduce
any
potential
risk
.
There
may
be
an
opportunity
to
find
out
:
Several
countries
have
stretched
the
interval
between
the
two
doses
from
the
3
weeks
tested
and
recommended
by
Pfizer
to
12
or
even
16
weeks
,
because
they
want
to
give
as
many
people
as
possible
at
least
one
shot
.
A
drop
in
myocarditis
cases
among
those
whose
second
dose
was
delayed
might
show
up
in
data
in
the
months
ahead
.
Lowering
the
dose
in
young
people
may
also
be
worth
considering
,
Liu
says
.
Pfizer
’
s
and
Moderna
’
s
vaccines
are
now
being
tested
at
lower
doses
in
children
under
12
,
with
results
expected
in
the
coming
months.Even
if
the
link
between
the
shots
and
myocarditis
firms
up
,
Liu
says
the
vaccine
’
s
benefit—being
well-protected
from
COVID-19—outweighs
the
risks
,
even
for
young
people
,
who
are
generally
at
lower
risk
of
severe
disease
.
But
Mevorach
says
the
trade-offs
may
be
different
in
Israel
,
given
its
extremely
low
numbers
of
SARS-CoV-2
infections—just
15
new
cases
were
diagnosed
yesterday
.
He
hopes
the
Ministry
of
Health
will
leave
the
decision
on
whether
to
vaccinate
younger
teens
to
their
parents
and
doctors
.
“
At
the
moment
,
we
no
longer
have
an
emergency
,
”
he
says
.

try
to
resolve
the
question
,
apparently
even
if
China
declines
to
allow
a
more
thorough
investigation
of
the
scenario
than
a
World
Health
Organization
(
WHO
)
team
conducted
earlier
this
year
.
The
president
’
s
move
came
as
several
top
federal
scientists
testified
at
a
Senate
hearing
this
morning
that
the
lab-leak
hypothesis
was
a
credible
explanation
for
the
emergence
of
SARS-CoV-2
,
although
less
likely
than
a
competing
scenario
in
which
the
virus
spilled
over
from
wild
or
domesticated
animals
into
people.In
a
written
statement
,
Biden
said
he
has
“
asked
the
Intelligence
Community
to
redouble
their
efforts
to
collect
and
analyze
information
that
could
bring
us
closer
to
a
definitive
conclusion
,
and
to
report
back
to
me
in
90
days
.
…
As
part
of
that
report
,
I
have
asked
for
areas
of
further
inquiry
that
may
be
required
,
including
specific
questions
for
China
.
I
have
also
asked
that
this
effort
include
work
by
our
National
Labs
and
other
agencies
of
our
government
to
augment
the
Intelligence
Community
’
s
efforts.
”
Biden
’
s
pronouncement
came
after
Xavier
Becerra
,
head
of
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
,
attended
the
annual
World
Health
Assembly
yesterday
and
called
on
WHO
to
push
forward
with
a
promised
follow-up
to
its
initial
investigative
trip
to
China
.
“
Phase
two
of
the
COVID
origins
study
must
be
launched
with
terms
of
reference
that
are
transparent
,
science-based
,
and
give
international
experts
the
independence
to
fully
assess
the
source
of
the
virus
and
the
early
days
of
the
outbreak
,
”
Becerra
said.The
notion
that
the
virus
might
have
escaped
from
the
Wuhan
Institute
of
Virology
,
which
conducts
coronavirus
research
,
has
gotten
renewed
attention
since
the
WHO
mission
to
China
struggled
to
uncover
information
that
significantly
advanced
the
natural
spillover
hypothesis
.
Identifying
an
animal
reservoir
of
a
new
virus
or
an
intermediate
host
that
transmitted
it
to
people
often
takes
years
,
but
the
immense
toll
of
COVID-19
has
added
urgency
to
the
search
for
how
SARS-CoV-2
sparked
a
pandemic.Recently
,
well-known
journalists
,
notably
former
The
New
York
Times
writers
Nicholas
Wade
and
Donald
McNeil
,
and
prominent
scientists
,
including
several
who
had
previously
expressed
doubts
about
the
lab-leak
idea
,
have
endorsed
closer
scrutiny
of
the
idea
,
in
part
because
of
the
apparent
lack
of
serious
attention
it
was
given
by
the
WHO
mission
.
The
team
’
s
40-page
report
devoted
just
three
pages
to
the
lab-leak
hypothesis
,
and
members
of
the
mission
have
said
they
were
not
qualified
or
able
to
conduct
a
thorough
investigation
of
the
hypothesis
.
In
a
letter
in
Science
earlier
this
month
,
a
mix
of
virologists
,
epidemiologists
and
other
scientists
also
called
for
further
investigation
,
writing
:
“
Theories
of
accidental
release
from
a
lab
and
zoonotic
spillover
both
remain
viable
.
Knowing
how
COVID-19
emerged
is
critical
for
informing
global
strategies
to
mitigate
the
risk
of
future
outbreaks.
”
Biden
’
s
statement
references
an
intelligence
report
on
the
origins
of
COVID-19
that
he
had
his
national
security
adviser
compile
after
the
November
2020
election
.
(
That
report
may
be
the
source
of
a
widely
shared
article
in
The
Wall
Street
Journal
last
week
revealing
that
three
workers
at
a
Wuhan
lab
that
conducts
coronavirus
research
received
hospital
care
in
November
2019
for
an
unspecified
illness
;
some
have
speculated
they
had
COVID-19
.
)
After
noting
the
two
competing
scenarios
for
SARS-CoV-2
’
s
origins—a
natural
origin
or
a
laboratory
accident—Biden
’
s
statement
says
:
As
of
today
,
the
U.S.
Intelligence
Community
has
“
coalesced
around
two
likely
scenarios
”
but
has
not
reached
a
definitive
conclusion
on
this
question
.
Here
is
their
current
position
:
while
two
elements
in
the
IC
leans
toward
the
former
scenario
and
one
leans
more
toward
the
latter
–
each
with
low
or
moderate
confidence
–
the
majority
of
elements
do
not
believe
there
is
sufficient
information
to
assess
one
to
be
more
likely
than
the
other.As
part
of
today
’
s
Senate
appropriations
hearing
on
the
2022
budget
request
for
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
(
NIH
)
,
agency
Director
Francis
Collins
and
National
Institute
of
Allergy
and
Infectious
Diseases
Director
Anthony
Fauci
were
asked
for
their
thoughts
on
the
origins
of
COVID-19
.
“
I
still
believe
that
the
most
likely
scenario
is
that
this
was
a
natural
occurrence
,
”
Fauci
said
.
“
But
no
one
knows
that
100
%
for
sure
.
And
since
there
’
s
a
lot
of
concern
,
a
lot
of
speculation
,
and
since
no
one
absolutely
knows
that
,
I
believe
we
do
need
the
kind
of
investigation
where
there
’
s
open
transparency
and
all
the
information
available
to
be
made
available
to
scrutinize.
”
Collins
echoed
those
sentiments
.
“
I
’
m
very
much
where
Dr.
Fauci
is
with
the
desire
to
be
as
transparent
as
possible
in
this
situation
and
really
try
to
find
out
what
happened
.
I
agree
with
him
that
it
is
most
likely
that
this
is
a
virus
that
arose
naturally
,
but
we
can
not
exclude
the
possibility
of
some
kind
of
a
lab
accident
,
”
he
said
.
“
That
’
s
why
we
’
ve
advocated
very
strongly
that
WHO
needs
to
go
back
and
try
again
after
the
first
phase
of
their
investigation
really
satisfied
nobody
.
And
this
time
we
need
a
really
expert-driven
,
no-holds-barred
collection
of
information
,
which
is
how
we
’
re
mostly
really
going
to
find
out
what
happened.

PMScience
’
s
COVID-19
reporting
is
supported
by
the
Heising-Simons
Foundation.On
5
May
,
Fox
News
host
Tucker
Carlson
delivered
a
10-minute
monologue
casting
doubt
on
the
safety
of
COVID-19
vaccines
on
his
show
,
Tucker
Carlson
Tonight
.
He
announced
that
almost
4000
people
had
died
after
getting
COVID-19
vaccines
,
and
added
that
those
data
“
comes
from
VAERS
,
”
—the
Vaccine
Adverse
Event
Reporting
System
,
a
U.S.
government
program
that
collects
reports
of
side
effects
possibly
caused
by
vaccines.It
was
a
misleading
statement
.
The
reporting
of
a
death
to
VAERS
indicates
nothing
about
what
caused
it
,
and
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
’
s
(
CDC
’
s
)
subsequent
investigations
have
found
no
indication
that
deaths
were
caused
by
COVID-19
vaccines
,
save
in
a
small
subset
with
an
extremely
rare
clotting
disorder
linked
to
one
vaccine
.
But
the
TV
segment
pulled
VAERS
,
a
31-year-old
early
warning
system
widely
relied
on
by
scientists
,
even
deeper
into
the
culture
wars
over
vaccination
.
After
the
broadcast
,
a
new
phalanx
of
antivaccine
activists
began
plumbing
VAERS
for
data
to
scare
the
public
about
vaccination
,
says
Angelo
Carusone
,
president
of
Media
Matters
for
America
,
a
left-leaning
nonprofit
that
is
monitoring
anti–COVID-19
vaccine
activity
on
social
media
.
“
We
have
been
tracking
these
attacks
since
February
and
this
one
resonated
in
a
different
way
after
Tucker
hit
it
,
”
Carusone
says.It
has
been
distressing
to
watch
for
researchers
who
use
VAERS
to
detect
real
vaccine
side
effects—such
as
the
very
rare
clotting
disorder
linked
to
the
Johnson
&
Johnson
(
J
&
J
)
vaccine—and
to
rule
out
others
,
thus
providing
both
safety
and
reassurance
to
the
public
.
“
I
can
’
t
believe
people
are
using
this
database
now
to
try
to
form
this
antivaccination
argument
,
”
says
Eric
Formeister
,
an
ear
surgeon
at
Johns
Hopkins
University.Formeister
and
colleagues
turned
to
VAERS
,
which
is
run
by
CDC
and
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
,
after
hearing
anecdotal
reports
from
patients
of
sudden
hearing
loss
after
COVID-19
vaccination
.
Their
analysis
of
VAERS
data
concluded
hearing
loss
was
no
more
frequent
,
and
possibly
less
frequent
,
among
vaccine
recipients
than
in
the
population
as
a
whole
,
as
they
published
in
JAMA
Otolaryngology
last
week
.
CDC
is
now
using
VAERS
data
to
probe
whether
COVID-19
vaccines
might
rarely
be
causing
heart
inflammation
in
children
;
it
has
not
yet
reached
a
conclusion.One
of
VAERS
’
s
strengths—its
openness—is
also
a
potential
weakness
in
the
politicized
COVID-19
era
.
Anyone
who
receives
a
vaccine
authorized
in
the
United
States
can
report
an
adverse
event
to
VAERS
,
as
can
doctors
,
family
members
,
and
others
.
That
openness
ensures
VAERS
receives
plentiful
reports—228,000
for
COVID-19
vaccines
alone
since
December
2020
,
more
than
four
times
the
number
received
in
all
of
last
year
for
all
vaccines.Some
worry
this
might
make
it
easy
to
post
false
reports
.
But
CDC
removes
data
that
are
clearly
fake
,
such
as
a
recent
report
purportedly
filed
by
Brazilian
President
Jair
Bolsonaro
about
an
adverse
event
in
a
beach
volleyball
superstar
.
And
deliberate
,
false
reporting
to
VAERS
,
which
is
a
federal
criminal
offense
,
appears
to
be
rare
.
“
We
don
’
t
have
evidence
that
there
is
widespread
fraud
or
gaming
of
the
system
,
”
says
Tom
Shimabukuro
,
deputy
director
of
CDC
’
s
Immunization
Safety
Office
,
which
oversees
VAERS
.
“
We
have
to
balance
keeping
VAERS
an
open
system
and
getting
as
much
information
as
we
can
on
vaccine
safety
against
potential
data
quality
problems.
”
But
even
honest
reports
can
be
used
to
spook
the
public
.
The
reports
themselves
are
not
vetted
,
and
,
as
CDC
states
in
a
prominent
disclaimer
,
they
“
may
include
incomplete
,
inaccurate
,
coincidental
and
unverified
information.
”
People
may
misinterpret
VAERS
,
which
is
easily
searchable
,
as
a
catalog
of
actual
side
effects
,
rather
than
possible
or
suspected
ones
.
And
it
’
s
easy
to
pull
data
out
of
context
.
“
For
those
who
are
out
to
scare
,
there
’
s
a
lot
of
material
there
,
”
says
Heidi
Larson
,
director
of
the
Vaccine
Confidence
Project
at
the
London
School
of
Hygiene
&
Tropical
Medicine.Take
Carlson
’
s
fearful
numbers
.
The
Fox
News
host
did
not
mention
the
reports
are
not
vetted
,
nor
that
among
the
approximately
4000
deaths
after
COVID-19
vaccination
reported
to
VAERS
at
the
time
of
his
broadcast
,
nearly
80
%
were
in
people
60
and
older
,
whose
mortality
from
all
causes
is
substantially
higher
than
in
younger
people
.
“
A
review
of
available
clinical
information
,
including
death
certificates
,
autopsy
,
and
medical
records
has
not
established
a
causal
link
to
COVID-19
vaccines
,
”
as
CDC
puts
it
on
its
website.To
counter
misinterpretation
of
its
data
,
the
VAERS
website
prominently
notes
the
reports
do
not
imply
causality
and
that
any
event
could
have
happened
by
coincidence
.
The
number
of
deaths
reported
after
a
COVID-19
vaccination
as
of
24
May—4863—represents
just
0.0017
%
of
more
than
285
million
doses
of
vaccine
given
,
the
agency
notes
in
a
continuously
updated
statement.But
experts
who
track
vaccine
misinformation
worry
the
imprimatur
of
VAERS
gives
misleading
claims
a
sheen
of
credibility
.
“
At
the
moment
when
we
need
to
persuade
people
,
there
is
something
so
incredibly
compelling
about
a
database
that
’
s
tracking
what
are
designated
as
‘
adverse
events
,
’
”
Carusone
says
.
“
That
Tucker
segment
has
created
this
catalyst
for
all
sorts
of
analysis
of
the
database
,
”
including
false
claims
that
the
vaccines
kill
babies
and
that
CDC
is
hiding
VAERS
reports.Carusone
says
the
episode
has
gained
particular
traction
on
Spanish-language
social
media
,
where
a
translation
was
published
2
days
later
.
There
,
false
claims
that
COVID-19
vaccines
cause
infertility
have
also
gained
attention
,
although
neither
VAERS
data
nor
Carlson
’
s
newscast
address
that
claim.Despite
the
disinformation
,
the
VAERS
system
is
critical
to
keeping
vaccines
safe—and
its
history
during
COVID-19
shows
it
’
s
working
,
CDC
officials
say
.
VAERS
data
were
crucial
to
CDC
’
s
ability
to
quickly
detect
and
guide
providers
and
the
public
about
rare
allergic
reactions
caused
by
the
Pfizer-BioNTech
and
Moderna
vaccines
and
the
even
rarer
problem
with
the
J
&
J
jab
,
says
John
Su
,
a
physician
who
leads
the
VAERS
team
within
CDC
’
s
Immunization
Safety
Office
.
Keeping
the
system
open
to
anyone
who
wants
to
report
a
suspected
side
effect
or
wants
to
consult
the
data
is
essential
,
he
says.But
Larson
says
CDC
and
the
public
health
community
need
to
make
a
“
serious
investment
right
now
”
to
more
aggressively
counter
the
misuse
of
VAERS
data
,
for
example
by
responding
as
quickly
as
possible
to
new
myths
that
are
gaining
traction
,
and
doing
so
in
lay-friendly
language
and
forums
rather
than
arcane
medical
journals
.
“
At
least
make
sure
you
get
the
right
information
out
there
as
soon
as
possible
,
”
she
says
.
“
Watch
how
people
misinterpret
[
VAERS
data
]
…
because
it
’
s
clearly
being
misinterpreted.

COVID-19
reporting
is
supported
by
the
Heising-Simons
Foundation.In
January
,
the
director-general
of
the
World
Health
Organization
(
WHO
)
,
Tedros
Adhanom
Ghebreyesus
,
issued
a
blunt
warning
.
The
world
was
“
on
the
brink
of
a
catastrophic
moral
failure
,
”
he
said
.
Wealthy
countries
were
buying
up
available
COVID-19
vaccines
,
leaving
tiny
amounts
for
others—a
replay
of
what
happened
during
the
2009
influenza
pandemic
.
“
The
price
of
this
failure
will
be
paid
with
lives
and
livelihoods
in
the
world
’
s
poorest
countries
,
”
Tedros
said.He
was
right
.
Today
,
some
rich
countries
are
vaccinating
children
as
young
as
12
years
old
,
who
are
at
extremely
low
risk
of
developing
severe
COVID-19
,
while
poorer
countries
don
’
t
even
have
enough
shots
for
health
care
workers
.
Nearly
85
%
of
the
COVID-19
vaccine
doses
administered
to
date
have
gone
to
people
in
high-income
and
upper
middle–income
countries
.
The
countries
with
the
lowest
gross
domestic
product
per
capita
only
have
0.3
%
.Tedros
lambasted
the
“
scandalous
inequity
”
again
in
his
opening
speech
at
the
World
Health
Assembly
on
24
May
.
By
September
,
at
least
10
%
of
the
population
in
every
country
should
be
vaccinated
,
he
said.Disparities
in
global
health
are
nothing
new
.
Lifesaving
therapies
such
as
monoclonal
antibodies
are
unavailable
in
large
parts
of
the
world
.
Even
vaccines
and
drugs
that
cost
pennies
to
make
don
’
t
reach
millions
of
people
who
need
them
.
But
the
COVID-19
crisis
has
exposed
the
inequities
in
a
distinct
,
acute
way
.
As
normality
is

as
Israel
,

health
system
is
buckling
under
soaring
case
numbers—and
the
world
is
still
recording
almost
5
million
cases
and
more
than
80,000
deaths
every
week.The
moral
argument
aside
,
there
’
s
a
very
practical
reason
to
try
to
distribute
vaccines
more
equitably
:
No
part
of
the
world
can
feel
safe
if
the
pandemic
rages
on
elsewhere
,
posing
the
risk
of
reintroduction
and
spawning
potentially
more
dangerous
viral
mutants.Things
might
get
better
.
The
COVID-19
Vaccines
Global
Access
(
COVAX
)
Facility
,
a
nonprofit
,
is
purchasing
shots
in
bulk
at
a
discount
and
distributing
them
to
the
world
’
s
most
resource-strapped
countries
.
Although
it
’
s
in
major
trouble
just
now
,
in
part
because
its
main
supplier
,
based
in
India
,
is
reneging
on
its
promises
,
there
is
reason
to
be
hopeful
:
Many
rich
countries
will
soon
have
big
stashes
of
superfluous
vaccines—1
billion
doses
4
months
from
now
,
by
one
projection—that
they
could
donate
to
countries
in
need.Production
capacity
is
increasing
rapidly
,
too
.
Some
projections
suggest
enough
vaccine
could
be
available
this
year
to
give
every
person
in
the
world
at
least
one
dose
,
although
getting
them
to
every
country
and
into
every
arm
would
still
be
a
major
challenge
.
For
the
longer
term
,
plans
are
now
afoot
to
build
vaccine
production
facilities
in
more
regions
of
the
world
to
pump
up
supplies
,
both
for
this
pandemic
and
future
ones.Here
’
s
a
look
at
all
of
these
efforts—and
when
they
might
offer
relief.COVAX
was
formed
in
April
2020
to
avoid
exactly
the
scenario
playing
out
now
.
Jointly
run
by
WHO
,
the
Coalition
for
Epidemic
Preparedness
Innovations
(
CEPI
)
,
and
Gavi
,
the
Vaccine
Alliance
,
the
organization
aimed
to
bring
together
countries
to
invest
in
several
vaccine
candidates
that
it
would
then
distribute
equitably
among
participants
.
High-income
countries
,
companies
,
and
philanthropic
organizations
would
foot
the
bill
for
the
92
poorest
countries.At
first
it
appeared
to
be
working
:
Almost
every
country
in
the
world
has
signed
up
and
COVAX
began
to
deliver
its
first
vaccine
doses
on
24
February
,
just
2
months
after
vaccinations
started
in
Europe
.
But
COVAX
lacked
the
money
to
compete
with
rich
countries
that
cornered
the
market
early
on
by
striking
purchase
deals
with
vaccinemakers
.
“
It
was
slower
than
anyone
would
have
wanted
in
making
deals
,
”
says
Nicole
Lurie
,
U.S.
director
of
CEPI
.
“
That
’
s
been
a
real
frustration.
”
Another
major
blow
came
in
March
,
when
skyrocketing
COVID-19
cases
at
home
led
the
Serum
Institute
of
India—which
COVAX
banked
on
as
its
main
supplier—to
halt
exports
of
its
vaccine
,
made
in
collaboration
with
AstraZeneca
and
the
University
of
Oxford
.
Exports
may
not
resume
until
the
end
of
the
year
.
“
We
’
re
in
a
bit
of
a
crisis
,
”
says
Seth
Berkley
,
who
heads
GAVI
.
COVAX
will
be
190
million
doses
short
by
the
end
of
June
.
“
We
’
re
now
trying
to
fill
that
hole
,
”
he
says
.
As
of
23
May
,
125
countries
had
received
just
68
million
vaccine
doses
from
COVAX.Serum
could
resume
shipments
earlier
than
December
,
Berkley
says
,
but
if
it
doesn
’
t
,
COVAX
could
be
short
1
billion
doses
by
the
end
of
this
year
.
“
What
we
thought
COVAX
would
prevent
is
happening
,
”
acknowledges
WHO
Chief
Scientist
Soumya
Swaminathan.High-income
countries
are
rapidly
immunizing
their
populations
against
COVID-19
.
Middle-income
and
low-income
countries
have
received
far
fewer
doses
to
date.Vaccine
donations
from
rich
countries
could
help
.
Because
it
was
unclear
in
2020
which
vaccines
might
work
,
many
countries
made
major
deals
with
multiple
companies
;
the
United
States
and
the
European
Union
advance
purchased
enough
to
vaccinate
their
populations
three
times
over
,
for
example
.
Although
not
all
of
those
doses
have
arrived
,
the
United
States
already
has
a
surplus
,
and
Europe
should
have
enough
vaccine
for
all
its
residents
this
summer.Wealthy
countries
should
donate
1
billion
doses
to
COVAX
by
1
September
and
another
billion
by
mid-2022
,
contends
a
report
published
in
early
May
by
the
Independent
Panel
for
Pandemic
Preparedness
and
Response
(
IPPPR
)
.
Mark
Dybul
,
former
head
of
the
U.S.
government
’
s
President
’
s
Emergency
Plan
for
AIDS
Relief
and
a
member
of
IPPPR
,
says
this
is
urgent
.
“
We
need
to
really
press
and
accelerate
and
get
all
the
excess
surplus
out
as
rapidly
as
possible
,
”
he
says.Many
rich
countries
,
concerned
about
viral
variants
and
new
outbreaks
,
are
hesitant
to
give
up
vaccines
they
might
still
need
,
Berkley
says
:
“
There
’
s
a
lot
of
unknowns
at
the
moment
that
make
people
nervous.
”
But
donations
have
already
begun
.
Norway
and
New
Zealand
have
both
given
the
vaccine
they
were
eligible
to
receive
through
COVAX
back
to
the
facility
.
Some
European
countries
are
ready
to
donate
stocks
of
AstraZeneca-Oxford
shots
,
whose
use
there
was
recently
restricted
to
older
age
groups
because
they
can
cause
a
rare
but
serious
clotting
disorder
.
The
biggest
pledge
so
far
comes
from
the
Biden
administration
,
which
aims
to
donate
80
million
doses
by
the
end
of
June
,
including
60
million
doses
of
the
AstraZeneca-Oxford
vaccine.There
’
s
also
hope
that
COVAX
may
add
more
vaccines
to
its
arsenal
.
It
is
relying
heavily
on
AstraZeneca
and
its
partners
because
their
adenovirus-based
vaccine
is
cheap
and
,
unlike
messenger
RNA
(
mRNA
)
vaccines
,
can
be
transported
in
regular
refrigerators
.
Still
,
Pfizer
and
its
partner
BioNTech
in
January
agreed
to
sell
COVAX
up
to
40
million
doses
of
its
mRNA
vaccine
this
year
.
On
3
May
,
Moderna
followed
with
a
deal
to
sell
34
million
doses
of
its
mRNA
shot
this
year
and
444
million
in
2022
.
Both
companies
said
they
will
give
COVAX
a
discount
,
but
didn
’
t
reveal
their
price.At
the
World
Health
Assembly
,
Tedros
made
a
bold
call
for
all
manfacturers
to
offer
any
new
product
to
COVAX
before
putting
it
on
the
market
,
or
to
commit
50
%
of
their
doses
to
the
facility.To
date
,
all
manufacturers
combined
have
distributed
fewer
than
2
billion
doses
of
COVID-19
vaccines
,
most
of
which
require
two
shots
.
But
much
more
vaccine
is
on
its
way
.
Many
of
the
14
manufacturers
of
authorized
products
continue
to
build
new
plants
,
contract
with
other
manufacturers
,
and
iron
out
production
glitches.Pfizer
and
BioNTech
hope
to
produce
about
3
billion
doses
by
year
’
s
end
,
one-third
of
which
they
plan
to
offer
to
COVAX
or
directly
to
low-
and
middle-income
countries
.
Moderna
has
ramped
up
to
1
billion
.
Three
billion
more
doses
could
come
from
the
conglomerate
organized
by
AstraZeneca
and
Oxford
,
which
includes
Serum
and
several
other
vaccinemakers
.
Three
China-based
companies
say
they
can
collectively
pump
out
3
billion
doses
of
their
vaccines
this
year
,
and
Johnson
&
Johnson
hopes
to
add
another
1
billion
doses
of
its
single-shot
vaccine
.
Some
850
million
doses
of
the
Russian
Sputnik
V
vaccine
could
come
from
the
Gamaleya
Research
Institute
of
Epidemiology
and
Microbiology
and
its
contract
manufacturers
.
And
companies
such
as
Novavax
,
CureVac
,
and
Clover
Biopharmaceuticals
all
have
vaccines
in
efficacy
trials
and
are
hoping
for
market
authorizations
in
the
months
ahead.All
told
,
14
billion
doses
could
leave
factories
before
the
year
is
over
,
according
to
a
document
written
in
advance
of
a
March
summit
about
stepping
up
the
production
pace
.
That
’
s
a
startling
number—before
the
pandemic
,
all
of
the
world
’
s
vaccinemakers
together
produced
at
most
5.5
billion
doses
annually—and
the
document
stresses
that
it
’
s
the
best
of
all
scenarios
.
“
We
have
a
set
of
manufacturing
challenges
that
make
it
unlikely
that
we
can
meet
the
14-billion
aspiration
,
”
cautions
Lurie
,
who
helped
organize
the
meeting.Raw
materials
,
such
as
disposable
bags
that
line
bioreactors
,
filters
,
and
cell-culture
media
,
are
the
biggest
challenge
.
“
Raw
material
inputs
have
nowhere
near
kept
up
with
the
anticipated
demand
,
”
Lurie
says
.
Importing
and
exporting
delays
have
exacerbated
the
shortages
,
and
travel
bans
have
made
it
difficult
to
move
experts
around
the
world
to
troubleshoot
manufacturing
snafus
.
Almost
every
vaccine
producer
has
failed
to
deliver
on
initial
promises.New
viral
variants
that
evade
vaccine-induced
immunity
could
limit
the
vaccines
’
usefulness
,
as
could
safety
problems
.
The
AstraZeneca-Oxford
shot
fell
out
of
favor
in
South
Africa
because
it
failed
against
a
variant
,
and
the
European
Union
plans
to
phase
out
the
vaccine
because
of
the
rare
clotting
disorder
.
China
’
s
Sinopharm
and
Sinovac
Biotech
vaccines
have
far
lower
efficacy
in
some
studies
than
other
products
and
may
require
a
third
short
after
6
months.Demand
for
several
vaccines
could
also
drop
because
mRNA
vaccines
work
so
well
and
are
easy
to
modify
for
new
variants
.
Withholding
them
from
large
parts
of
the
world
may
come
to
be
seen
as
an
injustice
,
says
viral
immunologist
Lawrence
Corey
of
the
Fred
Hutchinson
Cancer
Research
Center
.
“
We
’
re
going
to
be
judged
in
our
humanity
by
how
we
utilize
the
technologies
,
”
he
says.Allowing
more
companies
to
follow
the
vaccine
recipes
developed—and
sometimes
fiercely
protected—by
a
few
could
also
boost
output
.
AstraZeneca
and
Oxford
provided
a
license
for
their
vaccine
to
Serum
,
and
then
helped
the
company
learn
to
manufacture
it
in
India
,
an
intensive
process
known
as
technology
transfer
.
Most
vaccine
companies
have
shied
away
from
such
deals
,
however.Several
ideas
have
been
floated
to
change
that
.
In
May
2020
,
WHO
launched
the
COVID-19
Technology
Access
Pool
(
C-TAP
)
,
a
system
under
which
companies
with
proven
products
would
voluntarily
share
their
know-how
and
intellectual
property
(
IP
)
.
The
hope
was
that
new
manufacturers
could
pluck
whatever
they
needed
from
C-TAP
,
either
at
a
reasonable
fee
or
for
free
,
to
start
to
make
their
own
products
.
But
C-TAP
has
yet
to
attract
any
participants
because
,
critics
say
,
companies
want
to
hold
on
to
monopolies
and
see
sharing
as
a
threat
to
profits
.
That
has
amplified
calls
for
more
drastic
steps
,
including
taking
away
the
cornerstone
of
their
IP
:
the
patent.In
October
2020
,
India
and
South
Africa
asked
the
World
Trade
Organization
(
WTO
)
to
issue
a
broad-reaching
waiver
for
patents
and
other
intellectual
properties
that
pertain
to
“
prevention
,
containment
or
treatment
of
COVID-19.
”
The
idea
has
made
little
headway
,
although
proponents
were
heartened
on
5
May
when
U.S.
Trade
Representative
Katherine
Tai
issued
a
statement
explicitly
supporting
a
WTO
waiver
for
COVID-19
vaccines
.
“
This
is
a
global
health
crisis
,
and
the
extraordinary
circumstances
of
the
COVID-19
pandemic
call
for
extraordinary
measures
,
”
Tai
said.A
shipment
of
the
AstraZeneca–University
of
Oxford
COVID-19
vaccine
arrives
in
Accra
,
Ghana
,
on
7
May
.
COVAX
,
which
supplied
the
doses
,
has
had
a
slow
start.The
pharmaceutical
industry
decried
the
statement
,
arguing
that
giving
away
IP
would
remove
the
incentive
to
innovate
.
Inexperienced
new
vaccine
manufacturers
would
also
drain
the
limited
supply
of
raw
materials
,
Pfizer
CEO
Albert
Bourla
warned
in
a
recent
letter
,
“
putting
the
safety
and
security
of
all
at
risk.
”
Moderna
CEO
Stéphane
Bancel
said
waiving
patents
is
“
the
wrong
question
,
”
because
new
companies
would
not
be
able
to
produce
mRNA
vaccines
this
year
or
next
,
“
the
most
critical
time
of
the
pandemic.
”
Although
Moderna
has
promised
not
to
enforce
its
own
COVID-19–related
IP
rights
during
the
pandemic
,
making
its
vaccine
still
requires
licensing
deals
with
other
patent
holders—including
a
critical
one
held
by
the
University
of
Pennsylvania—and
,
most
important
,
know-how.Martin
Friede
,
who
helps
coordinate
vaccine
research
at
WHO
,
applauds
Moderna
for
waiving
its
patents
but
agrees
that
“
the
patent
by
itself
is
useless.
”
New
companies
would
still
need
to
set
up
facilities
,
train
staff
,
and
learn
how
to
produce
the
vaccines
.
A
patent
is
a
recipe
but
doesn
’
t
make
you
a
chef
,
Friede
says
:
“
I
’
ve
got
a
lot
of
cookbooks
in
my
kitchen
,
but
you
wouldn
’
t
want
to
come
to
my
house
if
I
’
m
doing
the
cooking.
”
He
and
his
colleagues
are
trying
to
create
a
training
center
where
scientists
and
manufacturers
from
low-
and
middle-income
countries
could
learn
how
to
set
up
the
industrial
process
for
mRNA
vaccines
.
“
You
go
back
to
your
facility
,
and
now
instead
of
spending
years
setting
it
up
,
you
’
re
up
and
running
in
a
matter
of
months
,
”
he
says.James
Love
,
who
runs
the
nongovernmental
organization
Knowledge
Ecology
International
,
says
waiving
patents
would
kick-start
the
process
for
many
would-be
vaccinemakers
.
“
It
’
s
been
illegal
for
a
year
and
a
half
to
even
work
on
these
vaccines
,
”
Love
says
.
“
Who
’
s
going
to
invest
in
developing
something
where
it
’
s
illegal
?
”
Others
say
the
threat
of
patent
waivers
can
act
as
a
cudgel
,
compelling
big
pharmaceutical
companies
to
share
their
patents
and
expertise
.
IPPPR
wrote
in
its
report
to
WHO
that
IP
waivers
should
be
implemented
if
companies
fail
to
negotiate
voluntary
licenses
and
technology
transfers
within
3
months.That
has
worked
in
the
past
,
Dybul
says
:
Lifesaving
antiretroviral
drugs
developed
in
the
1990s
long
remained
too
expensive
for
most
HIV-infected
people
.
But
the
threat
that
their
patents
would
be
steamrolled
led
Big
Pharma
to
share
its
knowledge
with
generic
drugmakers
,
and
prices
plummeted
.
To
Dybul
,
the
vaccinemakers
’
reaction
today
echoes
what
drug
companies
said
back
then
:
“
Just
let
us
produce
,
we
know
how
to
do
it
,
it
’
s
too
complicated
,
can
’
t
be
done.
”
But
he
acknowledges
that
vaccines
are
more
difficult
to
produce
than
drugs.Ideally
,
Friede
says
he
’
d
like
Pfizer
,
BioNTech
,
and
Moderna
to
“
play
ball
with
us
”
and
help
set
up
the
training
facility
,
but
he
’
s
soliciting
help
from
other
makers
of
mRNA
vaccines
who
have
their
own
patent
portfolios
but
don
’
t
yet
have
regulatory
authorization.Freeing
up
IP
could
allow
existing
plants
to
produce
vaccines
that
are
now
off-limits
.
But
in
the
long
term
,
additional
manufacturing
plants
will
be
needed
to
serve
the
needs
of
the
have-nots—not
just
for
this
pandemic
,
but
for
future
ones
as
well
.
COVID-19
variants
and
waning
immunity
to
the
virus
each
could
create
an
annual
need
for
several
billion
vaccine
doses
.
And
if
a
new
disease
surfaces
,
the
world
could
find
itself
again
needing
billions
of
doses
of
new
vaccines.The
inequitable
way
COVID-19
vaccines
have
been
rolled
out
underscores
the
limits
of
a
system
that
concentrates
manufacturing
power
in
a
few
locations

Access
Campaign
for
South-East
Asia
.
The
bulk
of
COVID-19
vaccine
doses
so
far
have
been
made
in
the
United
States
,
China
,
India
,
and
Europe—and
all
have
felt
pressured
to
vaccinate
their
own
people
first
.
“
Once
we
’
re
done
with
ours
we
’
ll
give
it
to
you
:
That
argument
is
very
much
in
your
face
and
it
’
s
the
subtext
of
the
whole
conversation
,
”
Menghaney
says.Jeremy
Farrar
,
head
of
the
Wellcome
Trust
,
suggests
establishing
global
enterprise
zones
that
produce
vaccines
in
countries
with
small
populations
,
such
as
Senegal
,
Singapore
,
Costa
Rica
,
or
Rwanda
.
“
They
could
provide
vaccine
for
their
own
domestic
citizens
very
quickly
and
could
then
be
manufacturing
hubs
for
the
world
,
”
he
says
.
And
he
advocates
that
countries
get
together
and
make
“
at-risk
”
investments—gambles
that
may
not
pay
off—in
these
new
plants.Rwandan
President
Paul
Kagame
said
at
a
13
April
African
Union
conference
that
his
country
has
already
discussed
construction
of
an
mRNA
plant
with
several
manufacturers
.
One
of
them
,
GreenLight
BioSciences
,
has
issued
a
“
blueprint
of
how
to
vaccinate
the
world
”
with
small
,
modular
mRNA
plants
that
it
can
build
in
Massachusetts
and
ship
anywhere
.
A
single
production
room
,
roughly
the
size
of
four
shipping
containers
,
could
make
most
of
its
own
raw
materials
and
crank
out
17
million
doses
per
month
.
For
about
$
200
million
the
company
says
it
could
provide
a
mini–vaccine
plant
and
a
“
clean
room
”
to
house
it
.
The
company
says
one
of
these
could
be
up
and
running
as
little
as
1
year
after
an
agreement
is
signed
.
“
You
could
leapfrog
our
ability
to
fight
pandemics
,
”
Dybul
says.Mark
Feinberg
,
who
heads
the
International
Aids
Vaccine
Initiative
,
likes
the
idea
,
but
says
it
faces
many
hurdles
.
Large
vaccinemakers
have
economies
of
scale
,
reliable
supply
chains
for
raw
materials
,
stringent
quality
control
,
and
regular
inspections
,
Feinberg
says
.
“
Rwanda
is
an
amazing
place
in
terms
of
public
health
and
commitment
to
innovation
,
”
he
says
,
but
“
it
’
s
not
like
you
snap
your
fingers
and
all
of
a
sudden
there
are
highly
capable
people
who
know
every
detail
about
the
manufacturing
process
and
can
ensure
that
it
’
s
operating
as
it
should.
”
It
’
s
also
unclear
what
vaccine
plants
and
staff
would
do
between
pandemics.A
year
and
a
half
into
the
pandemic
,
COVID-19
has
shined
a
bright
light
on
hugely
complicated
issues
.
“
The
challenge
that
’
s
being
taken
on
here
is
unprecedented
:
You
want
to
vaccinate
everyone
on
the
planet
.
That
has
never
been
done
before
,
”
Feinberg
says
.
“
You
might
say
:
If
we
do
this
in
3
years
that
’
s
an
accomplishment
that
is
unprecedented
in
the
history
of
the
human
race
.
But
if
you
actually
think
about
the
tragedy
that
COVID
is
imposing
,
that
seems
like
a
really
long
,
long
time.

’
s
COVID-19
reporting
is
supported
by
the
Heising-Simons
Foundation.I
’
ve
been
wrestling
with
a
dilemma
the
past
few
weeks
:
Do
I
stay
in
the
COVID-19
vaccine
trial
I
’
ve
been
enrolled
in
for
4
months—and
which
I
very
much
hope
will
be
successful—or
do
I
drop
out
,
take
an
already
proven
vaccine
,
and
protect
myself
sooner
?
It
’
s
a
question
thousands
of
trial
participants
have
faced
over
the
past
6
months
but
that
you
don
’
t
hear
much
about.I
knew
I
might
face
this
dilemma
since
21
January
,
the
day
I
drove
to
a
behemoth
academic
center
in
the
southeastern
part
of
Amsterdam
,
my
hometown
,
to
enroll
in
the
HERALD
study
,
a
large
efficacy
trial
of
a
candidate
COVID-19
vaccine
produced
by
the
company
CureVac
.
I
sat
down
in
a
small
basement
room
with
an
infectious
diseases
physician
who
provided
some
basic
information
about
the
study
,
gave
me
a
consent
form
to
sign
,
and
carried
out
a
physical
examination.Then
came
an
important
moment
:
I
was
going
to
be
randomly
assigned
to
receive
either
the
experimental
vaccine
or
a
placebo
.
The
researcher
clicked
a
few
buttons
on
her
computer
,
then
read
a
message
that
had
popped
up
on
her
screen
:
“
Thank
you
.
The
subject
has
been
successfully
randomized.
”
Half
an
hour
later
,
a
nurse
gave
me
an
injection
.
Neither
of
us
knew
what
was
in
it
:
12
micrograms
of
RNA
,
packaged
in
tiny
fatty
bubbles
,
that
might
save
me
from
getting
sick
or
dying—or
a
few
milliliters
of
saltwater
.
``
It
's
like
a
wheel
of
fortune
,
''
she
said.It
was
a
worthwhile
gamble
for
me
:
I
had
a
50
%
chance
of
receiving
a
candidate
vaccine
at
a
time
when
case
numbers
in
the
Netherlands
were
high
,
the
more
transmissible
variant
that
first
emerged
in
the
United
Kingdom
was
taking
over
,
and
it
might
be
many
months
before
I
was
eligible
for
a
proven
vaccine
,
as
doses
were
scarce
in
Europe
.
The
chance
at
protection
aside
,
I
was
happy
to
play
a
tiny
part
in
one
of
the
great
scientific
endeavors
of
my
lifetime—and
,
with
luck
,
help
another
vaccine
cross
the
finish
line.CureVac
looked
promising
enough
.
In
2020
,
scientists
had
shown
it
worked
in
hamsters
and
monkeys
.
A
phase
1
study
had
found
mostly
moderate
side
effects
,
and
the
12-microgram
dose
appeared
to
trigger
a
good
immune
response
in
human
volunteers
.
Although
a
latecomer
in
the
immunization
race
,
the
vaccine
,
named
CVnCoV
,
has
a
potential
advantage
over
the
two
other
messenger
RNA
(
mRNA
)
vaccines
,
developed
by
the
Pfizer-BioNTech
collaboration
and
Moderna
,
which
require
extremely
low
temperatures
to
remain
stable
.
CVnCoV
,
in
contrast
,
can
be
kept
at
5°C
,
the
temperature
of
an
ordinary
refrigerator
,
for
at
least
3
months
,
and
1
day
at
room
temperature
.
That
’
s
a
huge
advantage
,
especially
in
developing
countries
.
(
Pfizer
and
Moderna
are
working
on
less
fragile
formulations
as
well
.
)
CureVac
,
headquartered
in
Tübingen
,
Germany
,
seemed
set
to
play
a
big
role
in
Europe
as
well
,
if
it
managed
to
win
authorization
from
the
European
Medicines
Agency
quickly
.
The
European
Commission
ordered
225
million
doses
in
November
2020
,
with
an
option
for
another
180
million
.
To
help
meet
expected
demand
,
the
company
teamed
up
with
Bayer
in
January.But
first
,
the
trial
would
have
to
show
it
worked
.
Launched
in
December
2020
in
Germany
,
HERALD
ultimately
enrolled
more
than
35,000
people
in
four
European
and
six
Latin
American
countries.Being
a
research
subject
was
uneventful
.
I
had
no
side
effects
at
all
from
that
first
shot
or
from
the
second
one
,
4
weeks
later
.
My
participation
in
the
trial
did
not
lead
me
to
take
more
risks
,
a
well-known
phenomenon
in
vaccine
studies
.
At
times
I
even
wondered
how
useful
I
was
for
a
test
of
the
vaccine
’
s
ability
to
prevent
infection
,
given
my
low
exposure
risk
:
I
work
at
home
and
was
cautious
about
social
contacts
.
I
did
go
back
to
the
hospital
for
a
COVID-19
test
once
,
in
February
,
when
I
had
what
seemed
very
mild
symptoms
.
The
test
came
back
negative.The
written
information
I
received
about
the
study
did
not
discuss
the
options
should
a
participant
become
eligible
for
a
proven
vaccine
.
And
initially
,
it
looked
like
I
might
not
have
that
choice
.
Vaccination
in
Europe
has
moved
slowly
,
and
the
study
would
likely
report
the
first
data
within
a
few
months
,
the
study
team
told
me
,
before
I
became
eligible
for
an
authorized
vaccine
.
CureVac
planned
to
do
the
final
analysis
of
its
study
after
185
confirmed
COVID-19
infections
had
occurred
,
according
to
the
clinical
trial
protocol
,
but
the
first
interim
analysis
was
scheduled
after
just
56
cases
,
which
should
not
take
long
.
(
Efficacy
is
calculated
by
comparing
the
number
of
cases
of
symptomatic
disease
in
the
vaccine
and
placebo
groups
.
)
If
the
trial
reached
a
clear
conclusion
and
was
halted
,
I
would
be
unblinded
.
If
CVnCoV
had
been
shown
to
work
,
as
the
researchers
expected
,
I
would
have
essentially
two
options
:
If
I
had
received
placebo
shots
,
I
would
be
offered
the
vaccine
,
and
I
’
d
be
safe
.
If
I
had
received
CVnCoV
,
I
had
been
safe
all
along
and
wouldn
’
t
need
anything
else.A
CureVac
FAQ
,
still
posted
,
says
the
company
expects
the
first
data
from
an
interim
analysis
in
the
first
quarter
of
this
year
.
But
that
deadline
came
and
went
,
and
in
April
,
the
pace
of
vaccination
in
my
country
began
to
pick
up
.
Having
started
with
people
ages
90
and
older
,
municipal
health
services
were
working
their
way
down
the
birth
cohorts
,
and
as
the
weeks
went
by
,
it
seemed
increasingly
likely
that
my
year
,
1964
,
would
come
up
before
any
announcement
from
Tübingen.If
that
happened
,
I
could
also
be
unblinded
,
the
researchers
had
said
,
but
it
would
open
a
different
set
of
questions
.
If
it
turned
out
that
I
received
CVnCoV
shots
,
I
could
be
altruistic
and
stay
in
the
trial
until
its
completion
,
knocking
on
wood
that
the
vaccine
worked
as
well
as
the
other
mRNA
vaccines
;
or
I
could
err
on
the
side
of
safety
,
drop
out
,
and
get
whatever
the
government
had
planned
for
me
.
If
it
turned
out
I
had
the
placebo
,
I
had
the
same
two
options
but
staying
in
would
be
dicier
still
,
because
I
would
be
completely
unprotected
.
(
The
trial
would
not
give
me
the
vaccine
in
that
case
,
because
its
value
had
not
yet
been
shown
.
)
I
asked
two
scientists
who
had
also
volunteered
in
COVID-19
vaccine
trials
for
advice
.
Florian
Krammer
,
a
virologist
at
the
Icahn
School
of
Medicine
at
Mount
Sinai
and
a
subject
in
Pfizer
’
s
efficacy
trial
,
says
he
was
asked
in
an
email
in
December
2020
whether
he
wanted
to
be
unblinded
,
after
an
analysis
of
trial
data
showed
the
Pfizer
vaccine
was
highly
effective
.
“
I
was
contemplating
just
staying
blinded
,
because
of
course
,
I
’
m
a
data
point
,
”
Krammer
said
.
“
But
there
were
a
lot
of
COVID-19
cases
back
then.
”
Besides
,
if
it
turned
out
he
had
the
placebo
,
Pfizer
would
offer
Krammer
the
shot
,
and
he
would
remain
a
data
point
,
but
as
part
of
the
trial
’
s
other
arm
.
Krammer
chose
to
be
unblinded
,
learned
he
had
a
placebo
,
and
received
the
vaccine
in
January
.
He
is
still
in
the
study.My
situation
was
different
because
CureVac
did
not
have
efficacy
data
yet
.
Krammer
said
staying
in
would
be
“
noble
”
but
that
I
should
also
think
about
myself
.
“
Signing
up
for
a
trial
is
already
a
very
,
very
helpful
thing
,
”
he
said
.
“
Nobody
can
expect
you
to
stay
in
if
there
are
[
vaccines
]
available
that
will
protect
you
from
getting
severe
disease
or
from
dying.
”
He
pointed
out
that
dropping
out
now
would
not
void
my
participation
altogether
:
The
past
4
months
were
already
part
of
the
data
.
And
this
wasn
’
t
just
about
me
,
he
added
:
“
What
if
you
stay
in
the
placebo
group
and
you
get
infected
and
you
infect
somebody
else
and
that
person
dies
?
”
Virologist
John
Moore
of
Weill
Cornell
Medical
College
faced
a
slightly
different
dilemma
.
He
had
volunteered
for
an
efficacy
study
in
the
United
States
and
Mexico
of
the
vaccine
produced
by
Novavax
,
which
began
in
late
December
2020
.
Moore
says
he
decided
to
stay
in
the
study
even
after
he
became
eligible
for
a
proven
vaccine
at
his
hospital
at
some
point
in
February
or
March.Interim
data
from
a
study
in
the
United
Kingdom
in
late
January
showed
Novavax
’
s
shot
had
89
%
efficacy
,
and
on
5
April
,
the
company
announced
that
both
the
U.K
and
U.S.-Mexican
studies
would
switch
to
a
“
crossover
design
,
”
meaning
all
participants
would
be
offered
two
more
shots
.
Those
who
first
received
a
placebo
would
now
receive
the
vaccine
,
and
vice
versa
,
but
everybody
would
remain
blinded
.
For
participants
,
the
advantage
is
that
they
know
they
’
re
all
protected
;
for
the
company
,
it
’
s
a
way
to
keep
more
people
in
the
trial
,
allowing
it
,
for
example
,
to
do
better
studies
of
duration
of
immunity
and
of
the
responses
that
correlate
with
protection.Moore
accepted
the
offer
to
cross
over
and
received
two
more
shots
,
the
last
one
on
11
May
;
he
feels
confident
that
he
’
s
protected
now
,
but
he
remained
unvaccinated
for
4
to
6
weeks
longer
than
he
would
have
been
if
he
had
dropped
out
.
“
I
didn
’
t
think
that
delay
would
cost
me
very
much
,
”
he
says
.
“
But
if
it
had
been
4
to
6
months
,
then
of
course
my
dynamic
would
have
been
very
different.
”
CureVac
has
not
said
whether
it
will
move
to
a
crossover
design
.
In
fact
,
it
has
not
said
much
at
all
about
the
dilemmas
volunteers
face
.
Moore
,
too
,
said
I
should
make
a
decision
based
on
my
own
circumstances
:
“
You
can
leave
a
trial
.
It
’
s
not
a
prison.
”
On
16
May
,
my
age
group
became
eligible
for
an
mRNA
vaccine
.
I
went
online
right
away
to
lock
in
appointments
for
the
first
and
second
doses
.
I
had
yet
to
make
my
decision
but
I
figured
I
could
always
cancel
them.As
it
happened
,
I
had
a
scheduled
appointment
with
the
trial
team
4
days
later
,
for
a
physical
exam
on
day
120
after
my
enrollment
.
During
the
visit
,
my
fourth
,
I
told
the
researcher
that
my
turn
had
come
up
,
and
we
briefly
ran
through
the
possible
scenarios
.
Then
I
asked
her
to
unblind
me
.
She
swiveled
her
computer
screen
in
my
direction
so
I
could
see
the
steps
it
required
.
And
there
,
suddenly
,
it
was
:
“
placebo.
”
I
didn
’
t
have
to
think
much
longer
.
I
’
m
looking
forward
to
being
safe
from
COVID-19
.
I
want
my
2019
life
back—or
something
that
resembles
it
.
Summer
is
coming
,
and
even
with
my
two
scheduled
appointments
,
it
will
take
until
early
July
to
be
fully
protected
.
“
I
’

’
s
COVID-19
reporting
is
supported
by
the
Heising-Simons
Foundation.Eight
children
hospitalized
with
pneumonia
in
Malaysia
several
years
ago
had
evidence
of
infections
with
a
novel
coronavirus
similar
to
one
found
in
dogs
,
a
research
team
reports
today
.
Only
seven
coronaviruses
were
previously
known
to
infect
people
,
the
latest
being
SARS-CoV-2
,
the
spark
of
the
COVID-19
pandemic
.
The
discovery
of
this
likely
new
human
pathogen
,
along
with
the
report
of
an
instance
of
a
coronavirus
that
appears
to
have
jumped
from
pigs
to
people
many
years
ago
,
could
significantly
expand
which
members
of
the
viral
family
pose
another
global
threat.
“
I
think
the
more
we
look
,
the
more
we
will
find
that
these
coronaviruses
are
crossing
species
everywhere
,
”
says
Stanley
Perlman
,
a
virologist
at
the
University
of
Iowa
who
was
not
involved
in
the
new
work.The
researchers
have
not
definitely
linked
either
new
virus
to
human
disease
.
And
there
’
s
no
evidence
that
the
two
new
coronaviruses
can
transmit
between
people—each
infection
may
have
been
a
dead-end
jump
into
a
person
from
a
nonhuman
host
.
But
many
researchers
worry
the
viruses
may
evolve
that
ability
within
a
person
or
the
animals
they
normally
infect
.
A
complete
genome
sequence
of
the
virus
found
in
one
Malaysian
patient
,
reported
today
in
Clinical
Infectious
Diseases
,
reveals
a
chimera
of
genes
from
four
coronaviruses
:
two
previously
identified
canine
coronaviruses
,
one
known
to
infect
cats
,
and
what
looks
like
a
pig
virus.This
is
the
first
report
suggesting
a
caninelike
coronavirus
can
replicate
in
people
,
and
further
studies
will
need
to
confirm
the
ability
.
The
researchers
have
grown
the
virus
in
dog
tumor
cells
but
not
yet
in
human
cells.Unlike
with
SARS-CoV-2
and
other
known
human
coronaviruses
,
“
We
don
’
t
have
any
clear
evidence
that
this
particular
[
coronavirus
]
strain
is
better
adapted
to
humans
because
of
its
spike
structure
,
”
says
veterinary
virologist
Anastasia
Vlasova
of
Ohio
State
University
(
OSU
)
,
Wooster
,
lead
author
of
the
study
.
Human
infections
from
dog
coronaviruses
may
occur
“
at
a
much
higher
frequency
than
we
previously
thought
,
”
she
adds
.
This
particular
virus
might
not
transmit
between
people
,
but
we
don
’
t
know
that
for
sure
,
Vlasova
cautions.The
eight
children
whose
tissue
samples
Vlasova
and
her
colleagues
studied
were
mainly
living
in
traditional
longhouses
or
villages
in
rural
or
suburban
Sarawak
on
Borneo
,
where
they
likely
had
frequent
exposure
to
domestic
animals
and
jungle
wildlife
.
They
were
among
301
hospitalized
pneumonia
patients
during
2017–18
and
the
researchers
screened
their
nasopharyngeal
samples—tissue
from
the
upper
part
of
the
throat—for
a
large
variety
of
human
and
nonhuman
coronaviruses.Standard
hospital
diagnostics
for
pneumonia
or
other
respiratory
illness
would
not
have
detected
dog
and
cat
coronaviruses
.
No
one
has
been
looking
for
these
viruses
in
patients
with
such
illnesses
until
recently
.
“
These
canine
and
feline
coronaviruses
are
everywhere
in
the
world
,
”
Perlman
says.The
entire
novel
virus
sequence
from
the
children
’
s
samples
most
resembles
a
canine
coronavirus
.
However
,
the
sequence
for
its
spike
protein
,
which
attaches
to
host
cell
receptors
to
initiate
an
infection
,
is
closely
related
to
the
spike
sequence
of
canine
coronavirus
type
I
and
the
one
for
a
porcine
coronavirus
known
as
transmissible
gastroenteritis
virus
.
And
one
part
of
the
spike
protein
bears
a
97
%
similarity
to
the
spike
of
a
feline
coronavirus
.
This
chimera
is
unlikely
to
have
arisen
at
once
,
but
instead
involved
repeat
genetic
reshuffles
between
different
coronaviruses
over
time
.
“
This
is
a
mosaic
of
several
different
recombinations
,
happening
over
and
over
,
when
nobody
’
s
watching
.
And
then
boom
,
you
get
this
monstrosity
,
”
says
virologist
Benjamin
Neuman
at
Texas
A
&
M
University
,
College
Station.The
animal
that
actually
transmitted
the
novel
virus
to
the
people
could
have
been
a
cat
,
pig
,
dog
,
“
or
some
wild
carnivores
,
”
says
Vito
Martella
,
a
veterinary
virologist
at
the
University
of
Bari
in
Italy
.
He
plans
to
screen
stored
fecal
samples
from
Italian
children
with
acute
gastroenteritis
to
see
whether
he
can
find
something
similar.Researchers
already
knew
three
canine
coronavirus
subtypes
mix
readily
with
feline
and
porcine
coronaviruses
.
“
What
is
more
surprising
is
that
these
[
animal
]
viruses
can
actually
cause
disease
in
a
person
,
”
Perlman
says
,
because
one
would
expect
them
to
lack
some
of
the
genes
important
for
adapting
well
to
people.Seven
of
the
eight
children
whose
tissues
harbored
sequences
of
the
virus
were
younger
than
5
years
old
,
and
four
of
them
were
infants
,
mostly
from
Indigenous
ethnic
groups
.
Each
was
hospitalized
for
4
to
7
days
and
recovered
.
Scientists
divide
coronaviruses
into
four
genera—alpha
,
beta
,
gamma
,
and
delta—and
the
new
one
is
an
alpha
.
It
is
the
third
such
alpha
coronavirus
to
infect
people
;
the
other
two
cause
common
colds
,
and
most
people
are
exposed
to
them
early
in
life
.
That
pattern
may
explain
why
only
children
were
perhaps
sickened
by
this
new
one
.
Ralph
Baric
,
a
virologist
at
the
University
of
North
Carolina
,
Chapel
Hill
,
suggests
adults
may
have
some
immunity
to
the
newly
discovered
alpha
coronavirus
because
of
repeated
exposure
to
the
other
two.So
far
,
the
most
dangerous
human
coronaviruses—SARS-CoV-1
,
SARS-CoV-2
,
and
MERS-CoV—are
the
betas
.
Researchers
haven
’
t
seen
alphas
trigger
an
outbreak
of
serious
disease
in
humans
,
Neuman
says
,
“
but
that
doesn
’
t
feel
like
much
comfort
in
the
wild
world
of
viruses.
”
In
March
,
researchers
at
the
University
of
Florida
reported
in
a
medRxiv
preprint
the
first
evidence
of
a
porcine
delta
coronavirus
that
infects
people
,
in
serum
from
three
Haitian
children
who
had
fevers
in
2014–15
.
The
researchers
transferred
serum
samples
into
monkey
cells
and
were
able
to
grow
viruses
that
they
matched
,
genetically
,
to
known
porcine
coronaviruses
.
(
The
work
has
been
submitted
to
a
peer-reviewed
journal
.
)
Delta
coronaviruses
were
once
thought
to
infect
only
birds
.
Then
,
in
2012
,
a
delta
coronavirus
infected
swine
in
Hong
Kong
.
It
“
appears
to
have
jumped
over
from
songbirds
,
”
says
OSU
coronavirologist
Linda
Saif
,
who
went
on
to
isolate
the
virus
in
swine
cell
cultures.The
same
virus
caused
a
major
fatal
diarrheal
disease
outbreak
in
baby
pigs
in
the
United
States
in
2014
.
It
has
since
been
shown
to
infect
cell
lines
from
humans
,
pigs
,
and
chickens
;
lab
studies
have
shown
the
virus
causes
persistent
infection
and
diarrheal
disease
when
put
into
poultry
.
“
It
’
s
out
on
its
own
,
a
left
field–type
virus
that
infects
both
avian
and
mammalian
species
,
”
Baric
says
.
“
There
aren
’
t
any
other
coronaviruses
that
I
know
can
do
this.
”
Some
virologists
have
labeled
the
Hong
Kong
delta
coronvirus
a
pandemic
threat
.
The
Haitian
virus
differs
considerably
and
virologists
want
to
test
local
children
and
adults
for
antibodies
to
it
.
If
its
ability
to
infect
people
is
confirmed
,
it
may
also
be
viewed
as
a
pandemic
threat
,
Saif
says.Together
,
the
two
reports
point
to
the
importance
of
animal
diseases
in
public
health
,
and
the
need
for
coronavirus
vaccines
for
domesticated
animals
.
“
This
research
clearly
shows
that
more
studies
are
desperately
needed
to
evaluate
critical
questions
regarding
the
frequency
of
cross-species
[
coronavirus
]
transmission
and
potential
for
human-to-human
spread
,
”
Baric
says.Gregory
Gray
at
Duke
University
,
senior
author
on
the
Malaysian
chimeric
coronavirus
study
,
also
advocates
for
surveillance
among
pneumonia
patients
in
areas
known
to
be
hot
spots
for
novel
viruses
or
places
where
large
populations
of
animals
and
humans
mix
,
such
as
live
animal
markets
and
large
farms
.
“
These
spillovers
take
years
,
”
Gray
says
.
“
It
’
s
not
like
in
the
movies
.
They
go
through
different
steps
to
infect
humans.
”
So
far
indications
are
that
the
chimeric
virus
has
not
evolved
to
transmit
efficiently
between
people
.

not

coronaviruses
,
first
characterized
in
the
1960s
,
are
responsible
for
a
substantial
proportion
of
upper
respiratory
tract
infections
in
children
.
Since
2003
,
at
least
5
new
human
coronaviruses
have
been
identified
,
including
the
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
,
which
caused
significant
morbidity
and
mortality
.
NL63
,
representing
a
group
of
newly
identified
group
I
coronaviruses
that
includes
NL
and
the
New
Haven
coronavirus
,
has
been
identified
worldwide
.
These
viruses
are
associated
with
both
upper
and
lower
respiratory
tract
disease
and
are
likely
common
human
pathogens
.
The
global
distribution
of
a
newly
identified
group
II
coronavirus
,
HKU1
,
has
not
yet
been
established
.
Coronavirology
has
advanced
significantly
in
the
past
few
years
.
The
SARS
epidemic
put
the
animal
coronaviruses
in
the
spotlight
.
The
background
and
history
relative
to
this
important
and
expanding
research
area
are
reviewed
here.The
history
of
human
coronaviruses
began
in
1965
when
Tyrrell
and
Bynoe1
found
that
they
could
passage
a
virus
named
B814
.
It
was
found
in
human
embryonic
tracheal
organ
cultures
obtained
from
the
respiratory
tract
of
an
adult
with
a
common
cold
.
The
presence
of
an
infectious
agent
was
demonstrated
by
inoculating
the
medium
from
these
cultures
intranasally
in
human
volunteers
;
colds
were
produced
in
a
significant
proportion
of
subjects
,
but
Tyrrell
and
Bynoe
were
unable
to
grow
the
agent
in
tissue
culture
at
that
time
.
At
about
the
same
time
,
Hamre
and
Procknow2
were
able
to
grow
a
virus
with
unusual
properties
in
tissue
culture
from
samples
obtained
from
medical
students
with
colds
.
Both
B814
and
Hamre
's
virus
,
which
she
called
229E
,
were
ether-sensitive
and
therefore
presumably
required
a
lipid-containing
coat
for
infectivity
,
but
these
2
viruses
were
not
related
to
any
known
myxo-
or
paramyxoviruses
.
While
working
in
the
laboratory
of
Robert
Chanock
at
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
,
McIntosh
et
al3
reported
the
recovery
of
multiple
strains
of
ether-sensitive
agents
from
the
human
respiratory
tract
by
using
a
technique
similar
to
that
of
Tyrrell
and
Bynoe
.
These
viruses
were
termed
“
OC
”
to
designate
that
they
were
grown
in
organ
cultures.Within
the
same
time
frame
,
Almeida
and
Tyrrell4
performed
electron
microscopy
on
fluids
from
organ
cultures
infected
with
B814
and
found
particles
that
resembled
the
infectious
bronchitis
virus
of
chickens
.
The
particles
were
medium
sized
(
80–150
nm
)
,
pleomorphic
,
membrane-coated
,
and
covered
with
widely
spaced
club-shaped
surface
projections
.
The
229E
agent
identified
by
Hamre
and
Procknow2
and
the
previous
OC
viruses
identified
by
McIntosh
et
al3
had
a
similar
morphology
(
Fig
.
1
)
.In
the
late
1960s
,
Tyrrell
was
leading
a
group
of
virologists
working
with
the
human
strains
and
a
number
of
animal
viruses
.
These
included
infectious
bronchitis
virus
,
mouse
hepatitis
virus
and
transmissible
gastroenteritis
virus
of
swine
,
all
of
which
had
been
demonstrated
to
be
morphologically
the
same
as
seen
through
electron
microscopy.5,6
This
new
group
of
viruses
was
named
coronavirus
(
corona
denoting
the
crown-like
appearance
of
the
surface
projections
)
and
was
later
officially
accepted
as
a
new
genus
of
viruses.7Ongoing
research
using
serologic
techniques
has
resulted
in
a
considerable
amount
of
information
regarding
the
epidemiology
of
the
human
respiratory
coronaviruses
.
It
was
found
that
in
temperate
climates
,
respiratory
coronavirus
infections
occur
more
often
in
the
winter
and
spring
than
in
the
summer
and
fall
.
Data
revealed
that
coronavirus
infections
contribute
as
much
as
35
%
of
the
total
respiratory
viral
activity
during
epidemics
.
Overall
,
he
proportion
of
adult
colds
produced
by
coronaviruses
was
estimated
at
15
%
.8In
the
3
decades
after
discovery
,
human
strains
OC43
and
229E
were
studied
exclusively
,
largely
because
they
were
the
easiest
ones
to
work
with
.
OC43
,
adapted
to
growth
in
suckling
mouse
brain
and
subsequently
to
tissue
culture
,
was
found
to
be
closely
related
to
mouse
hepatitis
virus
.
Strain
229E
was
grown
in
tissue
culture
directly
from
clinical
samples
.
The
2
viruses
demonstrated
periodicity
,
with
large
epidemics
occurring
at
2-
to
3-year
intervals.9
Strain
229E
tended
to
be
epidemic
throughout
the
United
States
,
whereas
strain
OC43
was
more
predisposed
to
localized
outbreaks
.
As
with
many
other
respiratory
viruses
,
reinfection
was
common.10
Infection
could
occur
at
any
age
,
but
it
was
most
common
in
children.Despite
the
extensive
focus
placed
exclusively
on
strains
229E
and
OC43
,
it
was
clear
that
there
were
other
coronavirus
strains
as
well
.
As
shown
by
Bradburne,11
coronavirus
strain
B814
was
not
serologically
identical
with
either
OC43
or
229E
.
Contributing
to
the
various
strain
differences
in
the
family
of
coronaviruses
,
McIntosh
et
al12
found
that
3
of
the
6
strains
previously
identified
were
only
distantly
related
to
OC43
or
229E.Epidemiologic
and
volunteer
inoculation
studies
found
that
respiratory
coronaviruses
were
associated
with
a
variety
of
respiratory
illnesses
;
however
,
their
pathogenicity
was
considered
to
be
low.2,8,13,14
The
predominant
illness
associated
with
infections
was
an
upper
respiratory
infection
with
occasional
cases
of
pneumonia
in
infants
and
young
adults.15,16
These
viruses
were
also
shown
to
be
able
to
produce
asthma
exacerbations
in
children
as
well
as
chronic
bronchitis
in
adults
and
the
elderly.17–19While
research
was
proceeding
to
explore
the
pathogenicity
and
epidemiology
of
the
human
coronaviruses
,
the
number
and
importance
of
animal
coronaviruses
were
growing
rapidly
.
Coronaviruses
were
described
that
caused
disease
in
multiple
animal
species
,
including
rats
,
mice
,
chickens
,
turkeys
,
calves
,
dogs
,
cats
,
rabbits
and
pigs
.
Animal
studies
included
,
but
were
not
limited
to
,
research
that
focused
on
respiratory
disorders
.
Study
focus
included
disorders
such
as
gastroenteritis
,
hepatitis
and
encephalitis
in
mice
;
pneumonitis
and
sialodacryoadenitis
in
rats
;
and
infectious
peritonitis
in
cats
.
Interest
peaked
particularly
regarding
areas
of
encephalitis
produced
by
mouse
hepatitis
virus
and
peritonitis
produced
by
infectious
peritonitis
virus
in
cats
.
Pathogenesis
of
these
disease
states
was
various
and
complex
,
demonstrating
that
the
genus
as
a
whole
was
capable
of
a
wide
variety
of
disease
mechanisms.20
Human
and
animal
coronaviruses
were
segregated
into
3
broad
groups
based
on
their
antigenic
and
genetic
makeup
.
Group
I
contained
virus
229E
and
other
viruses
,
group
II
contained
virus
OC43
and
group
III
was
made
up
of
avian
infectious
bronchitis
virus
and
a
number
of
related
avian
viruses.21Given
the
enormous
variety
of
animal
coronaviruses
,
it
was
not
surprising
when
the
cause
of
a
very
new
,
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
,
called
SARS
,
emerged
in
2002–2003
as
a
coronavirus
from
southern
China
and
spread
throughout
the
world
with
quantifiable
speed.22–24
This
virus
grew
fairly
easily
in
tissue
culture
,
enabling
quick
sequencing
of
the
genome
.
Sequencing
differed
sufficiently
from
any
of
the
known
human
or
animal
coronaviruses
to
place
this
virus
into
a
new
group
,
along
with
a
virus
that
was
subsequently
cultured
from
Himalayan
palm
civets
,
from
which
it
presumably
had
emerged.25During
the
2002–2003
outbreak
,
SARS
infection
was
reported
in
29
countries
in
North
America
,
South
America
,
Europe
and
Asia
.
Overall
8098
infected
individuals
were
identified
,
with
774
SARS-related
fatalities.26
It
is
still
unclear
how
the
virus
entered
the
human
population
and
whether
the
Himalayan
palm
civets
were
the
natural
reservoir
for
the
virus
.
Sequence
analysis
of
the
virus
isolated
from
the
Himalayan
palm
civets
revealed
that
this
virus
contained
a
29-nucleotide
sequence
not
found
in
most
human
isolates
,
in
particular
those
involved
in
the
worldwide
spread
of
the
epidemic.25
In
the
animal
viruses
,
this
nucleotide
sequence
maintains
the
integrity
of
the
10th
open
reading
frame
(
ORF
)
;
whereas
in
the
human
strains
,
the
absence
of
this
motif
results
in
2
overlapping
ORFs
.
The
function
of
the
ORFs
in
the
animal
and
human
isolates
is
unknown
,
and
it
is
unclear
whether
the
deletion
of
the
29-nucleotide
sequence
played
a
role
in
the
transspecies
jump
,
the
capacity
of
the
epidemic
strain
to
spread
between
humans
or
the
virulence
of
the
virus
in
humans
.
Curiously
data
from
seroepidemiologic
studies
conducted
among
food
market
workers
in
areas
where
the
SARS
epidemic
likely
began
indicated
that
40
%
of
wild
animal
traders
and
20
%
of
individuals
who
slaughter
animals
were
seropositive
for
SARS
,
although
none
had
a
history
of
SARS-like
symptoms.25
These
findings
suggest
that
these
individuals
were
exposed
through
their
occupation
to
a
SARS-like
virus
that
frequently
caused
asymptomatic
infection
.
Infection
control
policies
may
have
contributed
to
the
halt
of
the
SARS
epidemic
.
The
last
series
of
documented
cases
to
date
,
in
April
2004
,
were
laboratory-acquired.The
SARS
epidemic
gave
the
world
of
coronaviruses
an
enormous
infusion
of
energy
and
activity
that
contributed
to
the
large
amount
already
known
about
the
virology
and
pathogenesis
of
coronavirus
infections
from
the
expanding
area
of
veterinary
virology.21Coronaviruses
are
medium-sized
RNA
viruses
with
a
very
characteristic
appearance
in
electron
micrographs
of
negatively
stained
preparations
(
Fig
.
1
)
.
The
nucleic
acid
is
about
30
kb
long
,
positive
in
sense
,
single
stranded
and
polyadenylated
.
The
RNA
is
the
largest
known
viral
RNA
and
codes
for
a
large
polyprotein
.
This
polyprotein
is
cleaved
by
viral-encoded
proteases
to
form
the
following
:
an
RNA-dependent
RNA
polymerase
and
an
ATPase
helicase
;
a
surface
hemagglutinin-esterase
protein
present
on
OC43
and
several
other
group
II
coronaviruses
;
the
large
surface
glycoprotein
(
S
protein
)
that
forms
the
petal-shaped
surface
projections
;
a
small
envelope
protein
(
E
protein
)
;
a
membrane
glycoprotein
(
M
protein
)
;
and
a
nucleocapsid
protein
(
N
protein
)
that
forms
a
complex
with
the
RNA
.
The
coding
functions
of
several
other
ORFs
are
not
clear
.
The
strategy
of
replication
of
coronaviruses
involves
a
nested
set
of
messenger
RNAs
with
common
polyadenylated
3-ends
.
Only
the
unique
portion
of
the
5-end
is
translated.21
Mutations
are
common
in
nature
.
In
addition
,
coronaviruses
are
capable
of
genetic
recombination
if
2
viruses
infect
the
same
cell
at
the
same
time.All
coronaviruses
develop
in
the
cytoplasm
of
infected
cells
(
Fig
.
2
)
,
budding
into
cytoplasmic
vesicles
from
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
.
These
vesicles
are
either
extruded
or
released
from
the
cell
within
the
same
time
frame
,
and
then
the
cell
is
destroyed.All
group
I
coronaviruses
,
including
229E
,
use
human
aminopeptidase
N
as
their
cellular
receptor.27
Mouse
hepatitis
virus
,
a
group
II
coronavirus
,
uses
a
member
of
the
carcinoembryonic
antigen
family
as
its
receptor.28
The
receptor
for
OC43
is
not
known
,
but
it
may
be
1
of
several
cell
surface
molecules
,
including
9-O-acetylated
neuraminic
acid
and
the
HLA-I
molecule.29
The
SARS
coronavirus
uses
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
II
as
its
cellular
receptor.30,31Since
2003
,
5
new
human
coronaviruses
have
been
discovered
(
Table
1
)
.
Three
of
these
are
group
I
viruses
that
are
closely
related
and
likely
represent
the
same
viral
species
.
In
2004
,
van
der
Hoek
et
al32
reported
the
discovery
of
a
new
human
coronavirus
,
NL63
,
isolated
from
a
7-month-old
girl
with
coryza
,
conjunctivitis
,
fever
and
bronchiolitis
.
Using
a
novel
genomic
amplification
technique
,
these
investigators
were
able
to
sequence
the
entire
viral
genome
.
Phylogenetic
analysis
demonstrated
that
this
virus
was
a
group
I
coronavirus
related
to
229E
and
transmissible
gastroenteritis
virus
,
a
virus
of
pigs
.
Screening
of
614
respiratory
specimens
collected
between
December
2002
and
April
2003
turned
up
7
additional
individuals
who
tested
positive
for
NL63
.
All
had
upper
or
lower
respiratory
tract
disease
or
both.Shortly
after
,
Fouchier
et
al33
reported
the
identification
of
a
coronavirus
,
named
NL
,
isolated
from
an
8-month-old
boy
with
pneumonia
and
grown
from
a
clinical
specimen
that
was
obtained
in
April
1988
.
Genomic
amplification
techniques
,
based
on
arbitrarily
primed
reverse
transcriptase-polymerase
chain
reaction
(
RT-PCR
)
,
were
used
to
identify
viral
sequences
.
Full
genomic
sequence
analysis
of
NL
showed
that
this
virus
was
also
a
group
I
coronavirus
and
closely
related
to
NL63
.
Four
of
139
(
2.9
%
)
respiratory
specimens
collected
from
November
2000
to
January
2002
tested
positive
for
NL.33
Respiratory
tract
disease
was
observed
in
these
4
children
whose
ages
ranged
from
3
months
to
10
years
.
The
discovery
of
both
NL63
and
NL
depended
on
the
propagation
of
the
viruses
in
cell
culture.With
the
use
of
molecular
probes
that
targeted
conserved
regions
of
the
coronavirus
genome
,
months
later
,
Esper
et
al
found
evidence
of
a
human
respiratory
coronavirus
in
respiratory
specimens
obtained
from
children
younger
than
5
years
of
age
,
which
was
designated
the
New
Haven
coronavirus
(
HCoV-NH
)
.
This
approach
was
based
on
the
theory
that
the
gene
for
the
viral
replicase
of
all
coronaviruses
has
conserved
genetic
sequences
that
encode
indispensable
,
essential
functions
and
that
these
sequences
could
be
targeted
for
virus
identification
and
discovery
.
This
approach
did
not
require
propagation
of
the
virus
in
cell
culture
,
organ
cultures
or
experimental
animals
and
could
be
performed
directly
on
respiratory
secretions
.
After
the
initial
identification
of
novel
sequences
of
HCoV-NH
,
specific
probes
were
used
to
screen
respiratory
specimens
collected
between
January
2002
and
February
2003
from
children
younger
than
5
years
of
age
whose
respiratory
specimen
tested
negative
for
respiratory
syncytial
virus
,
influenza
,
parainfluenza
and
adenoviruses
.
Of
895
children
,
79
(
8.8
%
)
tested
positive
for
HCoV-NH
by
RT-PCR
,
a
majority
of
whom
were
sampled
in
the
winter
and
spring
seasons.34
Sequence
and
phylogenetic
analysis
based
on
the
replicase
gene
showed
that
HCoV-NH
was
closely
related
to
both
NL63
and
NL
,
although
the
full
genomic
sequence
of
HCoV-NH
has
not
been
completed
.
Cough
,
rhinorrhea
and
tachypnea
were
present
in
more
than
one-half
of
the
children
infected
with
HCoV-NH
.
Eleven
children
were
in
the
newborn
intensive
care
unit
at
the
time
of
their
sampling
and
had
been
hospitalized
since
birth
,
suggesting
either
nosocomial
infection
or
a
less
likely
cause
of
vertical
transmission.One
child
,
a
6-month-old
who
tested
positive
for
HCoV-NH
,
also
carried
a
diagnosis
of
Kawasaki
disease
,
a
vasculitis
of
early
childhood
.
In
a
subsequent
case-control
study
,
8
of
11
(
72.7
%
)
children
with
Kawasaki
disease
tested
positive
for
HCoV-NH
while
only
1
of
22
(
4.5
%
)
age-
and
time-matched
controls
tested
positive
for
HCoV-NH
(
P
=
0.0015
)
.36
By
correlating
these
findings
,
Graf37
detected
the
presence
of
a
peptide
corresponding
to
the
spike
glycoprotein
of
NL63
,
the
closely
related
virus
identified
in
the
Netherlands
,
in
tissue
from
individuals
with
Kawasaki
disease
.
The
summation
of
these
findings
suggests
that
HCoV-NH
may
play
a
role
in
the
pathogenesis
of
Kawasaki
disease
.
Further
research
is
necessary
to
determine
whether
HCoV-NH
is
the
cause
of
Kawasaki
disease.In
January
2001
,
a
71-year-old
man
who
had
recently
returned
from
Shen-zhen
,
China
,
a
previously
SARS-endemic
area
,
presented
in
Hong
Kong
with
a
fever
and
productive
cough
.
Although
his
SARS
screening
was
negative
,
a
novel
group
II
coronavirus
sequence
was
amplified
by
RT-PCR
from
his
respiratory
specimen
with
the
use
of
primers
that
targeted
conserved
regions
of
the
viral
replicase
gene.35
This
novel
virus
,
designated
HKU1
,
was
genetically
distinct
from
OC43
,
the
other
known
human
group
II
coronavirus
.
This
virus
could
not
be
propagated
in
cell
culture
.
Seroepidemiologic
studies
,
based
on
antibodies
reacting
with
a
recombinant
HKU1
nucleocapsid
,
suggested
that
human
infection
with
HKU1
might
be
common.35
However
,
it
is
unclear
whether
the
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
and
Western
blot
assays
used
to
detect
HKU1
antibody
were
also
detecting
cross-reactive
antibody
to
OC43
or
other
human
coronaviruses.The
field
of
coronavirology
has
advanced
significantly
in
recent
years
.
The
SARS
epidemic
was
a
dramatic
reminder
that
animal
coronaviruses
are
potential
threats
to
the
human
population
,
although
the
exact
mechanism
of
species-to-species
spread
of
the
SARS
coronavirus
remains
obscure
.
NL63
has
been
identified
in
many
countries
.
This
virus
and
the
related
viruses
NL
and
HCoV-NH
are
likely
the
cause
of
a
substantial
proportion
of
respiratory
tract
disease
in
infants
and
children
.
The
impact
of
HKU1
is
not
yet
known
.
It
seems
clear
that
the
coronaviruses
infecting
humans
and
causing
respiratory
disease
are
heterogeneous
and
quite
widely
distributed
among
groups
I
and
II
.
It
may
be
that
some
of
the
newer
coronaviruses
represent
strains
similar
to
the
original
B814
and
OC
strains
that
could
not
be
further
characterized
in
the
1960s
.
Additional
human
coronavirus
strains
will
very
likely
be
discovered
,
which
stresses
the
need
for
further
investigation
into
the
virology
and
etiology
of
these
infectious
organisms.Question
:
What
is
the
actual
clinical
impact
of
coronaviruses
on
infectious
disease
prevalence
and
severity
in
the
child
and
adult
population
?
Kenneth
McIntosh
,
MD
:
Coronaviruses
are
common
,
and
they
are
generally
related
to
the
upper
respiratory
tract
family
of
disorders
.
They
also
trigger
asthma
in
children
and
adults
and
severe
respiratory
disease
in
the
elderly
.
Under
the
bell-shaped
curve
of
respiratory
infection
,
they
probably
cause
pneumonia
and
bronchiolitis
infections
in
the
infant
and
child
population
.
The
clinical
impact
of
coronaviruses
has
not
yet
been
fully
determined
because
much
still
remains
to
be
discovered
,
despite
recent
research
advances.Question
:
Overwhelmingly
SARS
seemed
to
have
its
greatest
problems
in
the
adult
population
,
which
probably
has
a
lot
to
do
with
how
it
entered
the
human
population
and
was
spread
.
Did
SARS
present
to
be
as
much
of
a
problem
for
babies
and
children
?
Kenneth
McIntosh
,
MD
:
No
,
interestingly
enough
SARS
did
not
seem
to
be
as
much
of
a
threat
to
infants
and
children
.
The
infection
appeared
to
be
less
severe
in
babies
,
and
babies
were
also
less
infectious
.
This
was
evident
by
looking
at
the
trend
of
secondary
cases
that
developed
.
This
is
in
marked
contrast
to
the
age-related
severity
of
most
respiratory
viral
infections
.
These
data
have
provoked
considerable
interest
and
discussion
,
but
no
good
explanation
has
surfaced
.
My
own
theory
relates
to
the
fact
that
almost
all
respiratory
viral
infections
in
adults
are
reinfections
,
and
these
occur
on
a
background
of
partial
immunity
.
Theoretically
,
if
you
took
a
virus
like
RSV
or
parainfluenza
and
introduced
it
for
the
first
time
into
the
human
population
,
adults
,
who
are
infected
and
have
no
preexisting
immunity
,
might
develop
more
severe
disease
than
babies
.
However
,
until
further
research
can
verify
this
,
it
can
only
be
seen
as
a
theory.strain

conditionsA
new
virus
called
the
severe
acute
respiratory

coronavirus
2
(
SARS-CoV-2
)
was
identified
as
the
cause
of
a
disease
outbreak
that
began
in
China
in
2019
.
The
disease
is
called
coronavirus
disease
2019
(
COVID-19
)
.In
March
2020
,
the
World
Health
Organization
(
WHO
)
declared
COVID-19
a
pandemic
.
Public
health
groups
,
including
the
U.S.
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
(
CDC
)
and
WHO
,
are
monitoring
the
pandemic
and
posting
updates
on
their
websites
.
These
groups
have
also
issued
recommendations
for
preventing
the
spread
of
the
virus.Data
has
shown
that
the
virus
that
causes
coronavirus
disease
2019
(
COVID-19
)
mainly
spreads
from
person
to
person
among
those
in
close
contact
(
within
about
6
feet
,
or
2
meters
)
.
The
virus
spreads
by
respiratory
droplets
released
when
someone
infected
with
the
virus
coughs
,
sneezes
,
breathes
,
sings
or
talks
.
These
droplets
can
be
inhaled
or
land
in
the
mouth
,
nose
or
eyes
of
a
person
nearby.Sometimes
the
COVID-19
virus
can
spread
when
a
person
is
exposed
to
small
droplets
that
stay
in
the
air
for
several
minutes
or
hours
—
called
airborne
transmission
.
It
's
not
yet
known
how
common
it
is
for
the
virus
to
spread
this
way.It
can
also
spread
if
a
person
touches
a
surface
with
the
virus
on
it
and
then
touches
his
or
her
mouth
,
nose
or
eyes
,
but
this
is
n't
a
main
way
it
spreads.COVID-19
symptoms
can
be
very
mild
to
severe
.
Some
people
have
no
symptoms
.
The
most
common
symptoms
are
fever
,
cough
and
tiredness.Other
symptoms
may
include
shortness
of
breath
,
muscle
aches
,
chills
,
sore
throat
,
headache
,
chest
pain
,
and
loss
of

there
are
many
steps
you
can
take
to
prevent
yourselves
from
getting
the
COVID-19
virus
and
spreading
it
to
others
.
The
CDC
and
WHO
recommend
following
these
precautions
:
If
you
have
a
chronic
medical
condition
and
may
have
a
higher
risk
of
serious
illness
,
check
with
your
doctor
about
other
ways
to
protect
yourself.The
CDC
and
WHO
recommend
that
people
who
haven
’
t
been
vaccinated
wear
cloth
face
masks
in
public
when
social
distancing
is
difficult
.
People
who
haven

been
vaccinated
should
continue
to
wear
face
masks
in
indoor
public
spaces
and
outdoors
where
there
is
a
high
risk
of
COVID-19
transmission
,
such
as
at
a
crowded
event
or
large
gathering
.
This
advice
is
based
on
evidence
that
people
with
COVID-19
can
transmit
the
COVID-19
virus
before
they
realize
they
have
it.Using
masks
in
public
may
help
reduce
the
spread
from
people
who
do

.
Non-medical
cloth
masks
are
recommended
for
the
public
.
Surgical
masks
may
be
used
if
available
.
In
some
locations
,
surgical
masks
and
N-95
respirators
are
in
short
supply
and
should
be
reserved
for
health
care
providers.After
you

the
CDC
recommends
that
it
's
ok
not
to
wear

The
virus
that
causes
coronavirus
disease
2019
(
COVID-19
)
spreads
mainly
from
person
to
person
in
respiratory
droplets
released
when
someone
with
the
virus
coughs
,
sneezes
or
talks
.
Less
commonly
,
airborne
transmission
can
occur
.
This
happens
when
very
small
virus
particles
linger
in
the
air
for
minutes
to
hours
,
potentially
infecting
others
who
are
in
the
same
area
—
even
if
the
infected
person
is
far
away
or
has
left
the
space
.
The
virus
can
also
spread
from
infected
people
to
surfaces
they
touch
,
but
this
is
less
common
than
person-to-person
transmission
.
Experts
do
n't
have
all
of
the
answers
about
COVID-19
yet
,
but
here
's
what
's
known
so
far
about
the
risk
of
getting
the
COVID-19
virus
from
common
surfaces
and
situations
if
you
’
re
not
vaccinated
:
Food
containers
and
packaging
.
There
's
no
evidence
of
anyone
contracting
the
virus
that
causes
COVID-19
after
touching
food
containers
and
food
packaging
.
Many
restaurants
are
now
offering
no-contact
takeout
and
delivery
to
lessen
the
risk
of
transmission.Still
,
if
you
're
concerned
,
it
's
reasonable
to
follow
general
food
safety
guidelines
.
Wash
your
hands
for
at
least
20
seconds
with
soap
and
water
after
handling
takeout
containers
,
and
then
transfer
food
to
a
clean
dish
using
clean
utensils
.
Wash
your
hands
again
before
eating
.
After
disposing
of
containers
,
clean
and
disinfect
any
surfaces
that
had
takeout
containers
on
them.Grocery
store
produce
.
It
's
possible
that
the
coronavirus
might
linger
on
fruits
and
vegetables
that
have
been
handled
by
a
person
with
the
virus
.
Whether
this
could
make
you
sick
with
COVID-19
is
n't
known.Best
practice
is
to
follow
food
safety
guidelines
and
wash
all
fruits
and
vegetables
thoroughly
before
eating
them
,
by
running
them
under
water
.
Soap
is
n't
needed
.
You
can
scrub
produce
that
has
a
rind
or
thick
skin
with
a
clean
produce
brush
.
Also
wash
your
hands
well
with
soap
and
water
as
soon
as
you
get
home
from
the
grocery
store.Clean
and
disinfect
any
reusable
bags
that
you
carried
to
and
from
the
store
.
Most
cloth
bags
can
go
through
the
washer
and
dryer
;
other
bags
can
be
cleaned
using
a
disinfectant
wipe
or
spray.If
you
’
re
unvaccinated
,
wear
a
mask
while
grocery
shopping
when
it
can
be
difficult
to
maintain
social
distance
from
other
shoppers
.
In
some
areas
or
at
certain
stores
,
wearing
a
mask
may
be
required.Close

Especially
to
people

Keep
the
rule
of
social
distance
in
mind
:
Try
to
stay
6
feet
(
2
meters
)
away
from
others.Respiratory
droplets
from
the
virus
that
causes
COVID-19
can
spread
to
a
person
6
feet
or
closer
after
someone
with
the
virus
coughs
,
sneezes
or
talks
,
which
can
put
you
at
risk
if
you
're
within
that
6-foot
circle
and

and
cats
.
There
have
been
reports
of
some
pets
,
including
dogs
and
cats
,
being
infected
with
the
virus
that
causes
COVID-19
after
close
contact
with
people
who
had
the

Often
,
the
animals
showed
no
signs
of
being
sick.The
virus
that
causes
COVID-19
mainly
spreads

Experts
do
n't
consider
animals
to
be
a
significant
way
that
coronavirus
spreads
.
But
this
is
an
area
of
ongoing
investigation.Treat
your
pets
as
if
they
were
people
,
keeping
them
at
least
6
feet
(
2

)
away
from

outside
your
household
and
staying
at
home
when

no
evidence
that
the
virus
that
causes
COVID-19
spreads
through
swimming
pools
,
hot
tubs
and
water
playgrounds.Still
,
it
's
a
good
idea
to
keep
physical
distance
between

Set
the
face
mask
aside
when
you
're

as
a
wet
mask
makes
breathing
difficult
.
But
wear
a
face
mask
when
you
're
not
in
the
water
to
help
minimize
the
potential
for
virus
spread
.
Stay
home
if
you
're
feeling
ill.Stool
,
urine
and
other
body
fluids
.
Respiratory
droplets
are
the
main
source
of
spread
of
the
virus
that
causes
COVID-19
.
The
virus
has
also
been
detected
in
the
stool
of
some
people
who
are
sick
with
COVID-19.Experts
do
n't
know
yet
what
the
risk
of
transmission
from
stool
might
be
,
but
the
virus
that
causes
COVID-19
may
have
the
potential
to
spread
through
untreated
sewage
.
Also
unknown
is
whether
the
virus
might
spread
through
other
body
fluids
,
such
as
urine
,
vomit
,
breast
milk
or
semen
.
By
following
social
distancing
and
your
local
public
health
guidelines
,
such
as
wearing
a
face
mask
when
you
go
out
,
you
help
to
lower
your
risk
of
infection
if
you

ill
if
you

There
is

enough
data
to
recommend
use
of
vitamin

to
prevent
infection
with
the
virus
that
causes
COVID-19
or
to
treat
COVID-19
,
according
to
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
and
the
World
Health
Organization.Several
recent
studies
have
looked
at
the
impact
of
vitamin
D
on
COVID-19
.
One
study
of
489
people
found
that
those
who
had
a
vitamin
D
deficiency
were
more
likely
to
test
positive
for
the
virus
that
causes
COVID-19
than
people
who
had
normal
levels
of
vitamin
D.Other
research
has
observed
high
rates
of
vitamin
D
deficiency
in
people
with
COVID-19
who
experienced
acute
respiratory
failure
.
These
people
had
a
significantly
higher
risk
of
dying
.
And
a
small
,
randomized
study
found
that
of
50
people
hospitalized
with
COVID-19
who
were
given
a
high
dose
of
a
type
of
vitamin
D
(
calcifediol
)
,
only
one
needed
treatment
in
the
intensive
care
unit
.
In
contrast
,
among
the
26
people
with
COVID-19
who
were
n't
given
calcifediol
,
13
needed
to
be
treated
in
the
intensive
care
unit.In
addition
,
vitamin
D
deficiency
is
common
in
the
United
States
,
particularly
among
Hispanic
and
Black
people
.
These
groups
have
been
disproportionately
affected
by
COVID-19
.
Vitamin
D
deficiency
is
also
more
common
in
people
who
are
older
,
people
who
have
a
body
mass
index
of
30
or
higher
(
obesity
)
,
and
people
who
have
high
blood
pressure
(
hypertension
)
.
These
factors
also
increase
the
risk
of
severe
COVID-19
symptoms.However
,
in
recent
years
two
randomized
clinical
trials
that
studied
the
effects
of
vitamin
D
supplementation
had
less
hopeful
results
.
In
both
trials
,
high
doses
of
vitamin
D
were
given
to
people
who
had
vitamin
D
deficiencies
and
were
seriously
ill
—
not
with
COVID-19
.
Vitamin
D
did
n't
reduce
the
length
of
their
hospital
stays
or
their
mortality
rates
when
compared
with
those
given
a
placebo.Further
research
is
needed
to
determine
what
role
,
if
any
,
vitamin
D
and
vitamin
D
deficiency
might
play
in
the
prevention
of
and
treatment
of
COVID-19.In
the
meantime
,
if
you
have
a
vitamin
D
deficiency
,
talk
to
your
doctor
about
whether
a
supplement
might
be
right
for
you
.
If
you
're
concerned
about
your
vitamin
D
level
,
ask
your
doctor
about
getting
it
checked.With

causes
coronavirus
disease
2019
(
COVID-19
)
.The
virus
that
causes
COVID-19
spreads
easily
among
people
,
and
more
continues
to
be
discovered
over
time
about
how
it
spreads

Data
has
shown
that

mainly
from
person
to
person
among
those
in
close
contact
(
within
about
6
feet
,
or
2
meters
)
.
The
virus
spreads
by
respiratory
droplets
released
when
someone
with
the
virus
coughs
,
sneezes
,
breathes
,
sings
or
talks
.
These
droplets
can
be
inhaled
or
land
in
the
mouth
,
nose
or
eyes
of
a
person
nearby.In
some
situations
,
the
COVID-19
virus
can
spread
by
a
person
being
exposed
to
small
droplets
or
aerosols
that
stay
in
the
air
for
several
minutes
or
hours
—
called
airborne
transmission
.
It
's
not
yet
known
how
common
it
is
for
the
virus
to
spread
this
way.It
can
also
spread
if
a

touches
a
surface
or
object
with
the
virus
on
it
and
then
touches
his
or
her
mouth
,
nose
or
eyes
,
but
the
risk
is
low.Some
reinfections
of
the
virus
that
causes
COVID-19
have
happened
,
but
these
have
been
uncommon.Risk
factors
for
COVID-19
appear
to
include
:
Although
most
people
with
COVID-19
have
mild
to
moderate
symptoms
,
the
disease
can
cause
severe
medical
complications
and
lead
to
death
in
some
people
.
Older
adults
or
people
with
existing
medical
conditions
are
at
greater
risk
of
becoming
seriously
ill
with
COVID-19.Complications
can
include
:
The
U.S.
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(
FDA
)
has
given
emergency
use
authorization
to
some
COVID-19
vaccines
in
the
U.S.
A
vaccine
can
prevent
you
from
getting
the
COVID-19
virus
or
prevent
you
from
becoming
seriously
ill
if
you
get
the
COVID-19
virus
.
Also
,
if
you
are
fully
vaccinated
,
you
can
return
to
many
activities
you
may
not
have
been
able
to
do
because
of
the
pandemic
—
including
not
wearing
a
mask
or
social
distancing
—
except
where
required
by
a
rule
or
law.If
you
haven

had
the
COVID-19
vaccine
,
you
can
take
many
steps
to
reduce
your
risk
of
infection
.
WHO
and
CDC
recommend
following
these
precautions
for
avoiding
exposure
to
the
virus
that
causes
COVID-19
:
If
you
have
a
chronic
medical
condition
and
may
have
a
higher
risk
of
serious
illness
,
check
with
your
doctor
about
other
ways
to
protect
yourself.If
you
're
planning
to
travel
,
first
check
the
CDC
and
WHO
websites
for
updates
and
advice
.
Be
prepared
to
wear
a
mask
and
use
appropriate
hand
hygiene
when
in
public
.
You
may
also
want
to
talk
with
your
doctor
if

health
conditions
that
make
you
more
susceptible
to
respiratory
infections
and
complications

Consider
how
to
deal
with
grief
caused
by
the
loss
of
your
normal
routine.The
coronavirus
disease
2019
(
COVID-19
)
pandemic
has
changed
people
's
lives
in
many
ways
.
In
addition
to
feeling
grief
over
the
loss
of
life
caused
by
COVID-19
,
you
're
likely
grieving
the
loss
of
your
normal
routine.Efforts
to
prevent
the
spread
of
COVID-19
during
the
past
year
have
affected
people
's
jobs
,
where
people
work
,
the
way
kids
go
to
school
and
play
,
and
the
ability
to
gather
in
person
with
family
and
friends
.
These
measures
have
also
changed
how
people
shop
,
worship
,
exercise
,
eat
,
seek
entertainment
and
celebrate
holidays
and
special
events
.
As
a
result
,
the
pandemic
has
had
a
major
psychological
impact
,
causing
people
to
lose
a
sense
of
safety
,
predictability
,
control
,
freedom
and
security.Why
is
the
loss
of
your
routine
so
upsetting
?
You
might
not
realize
it
,
but
you
do
n't
only
feel
attachments
to
other
people
.
You
also
probably
feel
powerful
attachments
to
your
work
and
certain
places
and
things
.
The
experience
of
losing
these
attachments
,
however
,
is
n't
as
well-defined
as
some
losses
.
And
unexpected
endings
can
cause
strong
emotions
.
This
can
make
it
hard
to
deal
with
what
's
happened
and
move
forward.You
might
also
find
that
changes
brought
on
by
the
pandemic
are
affecting
your
sense
of
self
.
For
instance
,
if
your
identity
is
closely
tied
to
your
job
,
losing
your
job
could
trigger
an
identity
crisis.Grief
might
cause
you
to
feel
numb
or
empty
,
angry
,
or
unable
to
feel
joy
or
sadness
.
You
might
also
have
physical
symptoms
,
such
as
trouble
sleeping
or
eating
,
excess
fatigue
,
muscle
weakness
,
or
shakiness
.
You
might
have
nightmares
or
socially
withdraw.Keep
in
mind
,
however
,
that
grief
can
also
have
some
positive
effects
.
For
example
,
you
might
feel
grateful
for
brave
and
caring
people
in
your
community
.
You
might
have
an
increased
appreciation
for
your
relationships
and
have
a
desire
to
help
others
who
are
experiencing
similar
losses.As
awful
as
it
might
feel
,
grief
serves
an
important
purpose
.
Grief
helps
you
recognize
that
you
've
experienced
a
loss
and
that
you
're
going
to
need
to
adapt.To
deal
with
your
grief
:
Focus
on
the
present
and
the
things
you
can
control
.
As
you
adjust
,
your
feelings
of
grief
are
likely
to
lessen.If
you
're
having
trouble
coping
with
your
grief
over
changes
caused
by
the
pandemic
,
consider
seeking
help
from

A
Canadian
couple
who
drew
widespread
criticism
for
flying
to
a
small
Indigenous
community
in
January
to
get
vaccinated
pleaded
guilty
on
Wednesday
to
violating
local
coronavirus
restrictions
,
according
to
court
records.The
couple
,
Rodney
and
Ekaterina
Baker
of
Vancouver
,
appeared
virtually
in
Yukon
Territorial
Court
and
pleaded
guilty
to
charges
under
the
territory
’
s
Civil
Emergency
Measures
Act
,
which
was
enacted
during
the
pandemic
and
required
people
to
isolate
themselves
for
14
days
after
entering
Yukon
,
records
show.While
the
Bakers
will
not
face
jail
time
,
they
were
each
fined
$
1,000
plus
a
$
150
surcharge
,
totaling
$
2,300
for
the
couple.
“
Fortunately
,
nothing
physical
happened
in
this
case
,
no
one
got
Covid
as
a
result
,
”
Judge
Michael
Cozens
said
during
court
proceedings
,
according
to
the
Canadian
Broadcasting
Corporation
.
“
There
was
harm
,
but
the
harm
wasn
’
t
anyone
catching
Covid
.
It
was
certainly
psychological.
”
The
Bakers
traveled
about
1,200
miles
to
Whitehorse
,
Yukon
’
s
capital
,
on
Jan.
19
.
Two
days
later
,
bypassing
the
required
two
weeks
of
quarantine
,
the
couple
chartered
a
flight
to
Beaver
Creek
,
about
300
miles
northwest
of
Whitehorse
,
and
posed
as
motel
workers
in
the
area
and
received
vaccinations
.
Later
that
day
,
the
couple
returned
to
Whitehorse
,
where
the
authorities
found
them.Within
days
,
Mr.
Baker
,
who
had
been
the
chief
executive
of
the
Great
Canadian
Gaming
Corporation
,
which
operates
casinos
and
hotels
across
Canada
,
resigned
from
his
position
.
Ms.
Baker
is
an
actress.Kelly
McGill
,
who
prosecuted
the
case
as
part
of
Yukon
’
s
legal
services
branch
,
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
on
Thursday.Beaver
Creek
,
which
relies
heavily
on
traffic
from
the
Alaska
Highway
,
has
suffered
economically
amid
travel
restrictions
during
the
pandemic
.
The
community
was
made
a
priority
for
vaccinations
in
part
because
of
its
remoteness
,
and
shots
were
made
available
to
adults
of
all
ages
.
Yukon
identification
cards
were
not
required.The
couple
’
s
actions
highlighted
both
the
complexities
of
a
global
vaccine
rollout
and
the
inequities
in
vaccine
distribution
,
made
all
the
more
complicated
by
the
disproportionately
high
rates
of
infection
and
death
among
poor
people
and
people
of
color
.
These
issues
were
especially
fraught
amid
vaccine
shortages
and
distribution
problems.Jennifer
Cunningham
,
the
couple
’
s
lawyer
,
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
on
Thursday.John
Streicker
,
Yukon
’
s
community
services
minister
,
said
at
the
time
that
he
was
“
outraged
”
by
the
couple
’
s
“
selfish
behavior.
”
Similarly
,
Angela
Demit
,
the
chief
of
the
White
River
First
Nation
,
called
the
Bakers
“
privileged
multimillionaires.
”
“
It
’
s
clear
to
me
that
because
we
are
a
predominantly
Indigenous
community
,
that
they
assumed
we
were
naïve
,
”
she
said
.
“
There
must
be
a
clear
signal
sent
that
this
behavior
is
unacceptable.
”
News
headlines
and
health
experts
on
social
media
are
sounding
the
alarm
over
another
variant
of
the
coronavirus
,
this
time
Delta
,
claiming
it
is
much
more
contagious
and
perhaps
more
lethal
than
any
other
variant
seen
so
far
.
It
’
s
easy
to
understand
why
:
New
variants
of
the
virus
continue
to
emerge
,
and
cases
are
rising
in
many
countries
.
But
whether
new
variants
pose
a
unique
or
substantial
risk
is
still
unknown
,
and
as
virologists
,
we
are
concerned
that
misunderstanding
variants
and
the
risk
they
pose
can
cause
confusion
and
panic.As
the
coronavirus
spread
globally
,
its
genome
changed
—
mutated
—
as
expected
for
any
virus
.
These
mutations
may
affect
the
virus
’
s
“
fitness
,
”
its
ability
to
reproduce
and
spread
.
Some
mutations
weaken
a
virus
,
some
have
no
measurable
effect
,
and
some
make
it
stronger.As
a
virus
becomes
more
fit
,
it
will
outcompete
less
fit
viruses
—
and
Delta
is
not
the
first
variant
that
has
beat
its
predecessors
and
competitors
in
certain
areas
.
There
’
s
the
Alpha
variant
that
first
became
dominant
in
Britain
,
and
the
Gamma
variant
that
first
became
dominant
in
Brazil
.
Such
changes
are
not
unique
to
the
coronavirus
.
Increased
viral
fitness
happens
during
every
flu
season
and
is
why
some
flu
variants
may
circulate
more
widely
than
others.Just
because
a
variant
displaces
another
does
not
necessarily
mean
it
is
more
infectious
or
more
deadly
to
the
people
who
become
infected
with
it
.
As
has
been
true
for
the
past
year
and
a
half
,
human
behavior
is
far
more
important
in
shaping
the
course
of
the
pandemic
than
any
variant.There
are
many
ways
that
a
virus
can
mutate
to
increase
its
fitness
.
While
there
’
s
been
much
focus
on
changes
in
the
virus
’
s
spike
proteins
,
which
allow
the
coronavirus
to
invade
cells
,
a
virus
can
also
sustain
changes
in
other
proteins
.
Such
changes
can
allow
the
virus
to
replicate
more
easily
or
evade
the
immune
system
,
for
example
.
They
may
even
allow
the
virus
to
persist
longer
in
nasal
passages.Determining
what
impact
a
given
mutation
has
requires
substantial
laboratory
research
.
Sometimes
,
early
conclusions
about
a
particular
mutation
can
be
incorrect
.
When
the
first
variant
of
note
,
D614G
,
emerged
last
winter
,
some
scientists
believed
changes
to
the
virus
’
s
spike
protein
made
the
virus
more
contagious
.
But
subsequent
research
showed
that
was
not
the
case
.
Even
so
,
each
time
a
new
change
in
the
spike
protein
is
identified
,
many
experts
presume
the
variant
is
more
virulent
and
“
of
concern.
”
But
whether
any
variant
is
biologically
more
transmissible
or
causes
more
severe
illness
has
not
been
rigorously
tested.Right
now
,
conclusions
about
variant
transmissibility
are
based
largely
on
how
widespread
the
variant
is
.
A
variant
might
be
deemed
more
contagious
because
it
makes
up
a
higher
proportion
of
new
infections
.
Delta
is
now
the
most
common
variant
in
India
and
Britain
,
accounting
for
more
than
90
percent
of
new
cases
,
and
over
20
percent
of
new
infections
in
the
United
States
.
Not
all
virologists
,
including
us
,
agree
that
measurements
like
this
are
sufficient
to
declare
a
variant
more
transmissible
or
more
contagious
.
What
’
s
clear
is
Delta
may
be
the
fitter
and
dominant
variant
for
now.To
determine
increased
transmissibility
,
the
ability
of
the
virus
to
be
passed
on
from
one
person
to
another
,
requires
more
than
measuring
infection
rates
.
It
may
require
experiments
in
people
,
which
are
unethical
to
conduct.Changes
in
people
’
s
activities
contribute
to
the
rise
of
infections
—
such
as
travel
,
failure
to
mask
and
to
adhere
to
physical
distancing
policies
,
and
most
important
right
now
,
insufficient
vaccination
—
and
these
are
often
not
considered
in
public
discussion
of
variants.The
huge
infection
numbers
in
India
,
Nigeria
and
other
places
are
not
necessarily
because
of
a
particular
variant
,
but
in
large
part
because
of
breached
containment
measures
and
crowded
populations
with
poor
public
health
infrastructures
.
If
people
are
in
situations
in
which
they
can
be
infected
with
the
coronavirus
,
it
’
s
highly
likely
they
will
be
infected
with
the
fittest
variant
in
the
area
.
Right
now
,
in
many
places
,
that
’
s
Delta.What
’
s
important
to
understand
is
that
people
infected
with
the
variants
do
not
necessarily
develop
more
severe
disease
or
die
more
frequently
from
the
coronavirus
,
and
it
is
essential
to
get
vaccinated.The
coronavirus
vaccines
that
have
been
developed
are
very
effective
in
preventing
severe
disease
and
death
caused
by
all
variants
,
including
Delta
.
Vaccines
might
not
always
prevent
infections
,
but
they
make
a
substantial
impact
in
reducing
virus
spread
and
risk
for
serious
health
problems
.
People
who
are
unvaccinated
are
at
a
great
risk
for
infection
and
harm
from
any
variant
of
the
coronavirus.During
a
pandemic
,
a
time
of
unknowns
,
people
want
immediate
answers
to
the
question
,
what
does
this
mutation
mean
?
Providing
the
correct
answers
may
require
years
of
research
.
For
now
,
there
’
s
little
evidence
that
the
virus
is
on
an
endless
trajectory
of
increased
transmission
and
virulence
.
Today
’
s
vaccines
can
still
end
this
pandemic.As
vaccinations
become
more
widely
available
for
people
in
the
United
States
and
travel
starts
picking
up
,
many
people
have
started
sharing
their
vaccination
cards
on
social
media
as
prized
new
possessions.With
some
destinations
,
cruise
lines
and
venues
already
requiring
travelers
to
provide
proof
of
vaccination
against
Covid-19
,
keeping
that
record
is
key
.
In
New
York
,
for
example
,
which
reopened
in
May
,
proof
of
vaccination
or
a
recent
negative
test
may
be
required
for
entry
into
some
large
venues
or
catered
events
.
Those
unvaccinated
will
be
instructed
to
wear
a
mask
,
practice
social
distancing
and
depending
on
the
venue
,
could
be
assigned
to
a
section
specific
to
their
vaccination
status
.
There
are
already
a
number
of
vaccination
“
passport
”
initiatives
underway
that
would
make
vaccination
status
easy
to
share
digitally
.
Clear
,
a
biometric
screening
program
used
in
airports
across
the
country
,
and
the
technology
company
IBM
have
created
their
own
passes
,
for
instance
.
And
in
March
,
New
York
became
the
first
state
to
introduce
a
digital
tool
,
called
Excelsior
Pass
,
to
allow
people
to
easily
show
that
they
have
either
tested
negative
or
been
inoculated
against
the
virus
in
order
to
gain
entry
into
some
events
and
venues.But
until
such
measures
are
taken
more
widely
across
the
country
,
you
’
ll
want
to
hang
onto
that
little
card.Here
’
s
everything
you
need
to
know
about
your
vaccine
record
,
why
it
’
s
important
and
how
to
keep
it
safe.The
vaccine
card
,
given
after
your
first
shot
and
then
updated
if
your
vaccine
requires
a
second
one
,
includes
the
vaccine
manufacturer
,
the
dose
numbers
and
the
date
and
location
each
was
administered
,
according
to
Alex
Brown
,
a
spokeswoman
for
Walgreens
,
which
is
administering
vaccinations
at
all
of
its
more
than
9,000
stores
nationwide.Walgreens
,
like
other
providers
,
has
made
its
records
digital
,
Ms.
Brown
said
.
Patients
can
access
their
vaccine
records
via
the
company
’
s
website
or
mobile
app.Walmart
and
Sam
’
s
Club
are
already
offering
their
patrons
digital
access
to
their
vaccine
records
through
both
the
Health
Pass
by
Clear
and
the
CommonHealth
and
CommonPass
apps
from
the
Geneva-based
nonprofit
,
the
Commons
Project
Foundation.
“
Our
goal
is
to
give
customers
vaccinated
at
Walmart
free
and
secure
digital
access
to
their
vaccine
record
and
enable
them
to
share
that
information
with
third
parties
seeking
to
confirm
their
vaccination
status
,
”
John
Furner
,
the
chief
executive
officer
and
president
of
Walmart
U.S.
,
said
in
a
statement.Getting
a
new
card
is
easy
enough
if
you
got
vaccinated
at
a
pharmacy
like
Walgreens
.
Ms.
Brown
said
that
anyone
who
loses
their
card
should
return
to
where
they
were
vaccinated
and
a
pharmacy
employee
can
print
out
a
new
card
from
the
patient
’
s
electronic
records.Vaccinations
are
also
tracked
by
state
health
departments
,
so
you
can
reach
out
to
your
state
’
s
agency
to
get
a
replacement
card
,
according
to
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
.
The
agency
lists
contact
information
for
the
Immunization
Information
System
in
each
state
,
which
tracks
vaccinations
,
on
its
website.Start
by
taking
a
picture
of
it
with
your
phone
,
so
you
’
ll
have
the
information
in
your
photo
library
,
and
emailing
it
to
yourself
as
backup
,
said
Dr.
Uchenna
Ikediobi
,
an
assistant
professor
of
general
internal
medicine
and
infectious
diseases
at
Yale
University.Laminating
your
card
will
make
it
more
durable
if
you
’
re
planning
to
carry
it
around
in
your
wallet
,
though
there
has
been
some
concern
about
lamination
because
it
would
prevent
information
from
future
booster
shots
from
being
added
.
But
Dr.
Ikediobi
said
that
this
“
may
be
a
moot
point
if
new
cards
are
issued
after
a
booster
shot
,
as
would
seem
likely.
”
A
number
of
companies
have
jumped
in
to
offer
free
lamination
.
Staples
is
offering
free
lamination
of
vaccine
cards
for
those
who
have
gotten
their
doses
,
according
to
Jocelyn
Moruzzi
,
a
spokeswoman
for
the
office
goods
retailer
.
The
offer
is
valid
at
all
of
the
company
’
s
United
States
locations
with
the
offer
code
81450
and
will
end
on
July
31.
“
Customers
began
seeking
out
ways
to
protect
their
Covid-19
vaccine
record
cards
,
knowing
they
will
likely
be
important
to
have
on
hand
in
the
future
,
”
Craig
Grayson
,
vice
president
of
print
and
marketing
services
for
Staples
,
said
in
an
email
.
“
Leveraging
our
existing
capabilities
in
store
felt
like
a
natural
way
to
provide
a
free
solution.
”
People
can
also
get
their
completed
vaccine
cards
laminated
for
free
at
Office
Depot
and
OfficeMax
stores
nationwide
using
the
code
52516714
through
July
25.Dr
.
Ikediobi
also
recommends
keeping
the
card
in
a
safe
place
,
as
you
would
your
passport
,
rather
than
carrying
it
around
.
“
It
does
not
necessarily
need
to
be
on
your
person
at
all
times
,
”
she
said.In
some
cases
,
yes
.
Border
entry
requirements
are
set
by
governments
,
not
by
airlines
or
by
the
International
Air
Transport
Association
,
the
trade
association
for
the
world
’
s
airlines
.
Some
destinations
and
cruise
lines
have
started
requiring
that
travelers
be
fully
vaccinated
before
they
travel
.
As
of
March
26
,
fully
vaccinated
Americans
who
can
present
proof
of
vaccination
can
visit
Iceland
,
for
example
,
and
avoid
border
measures
such
as
testing
and
quarantining
,
the
country
’
s
government
said.The
cruise
line
Royal
Caribbean
is
requiring
passengers
and
crew
members
16
or
older
to
be
vaccinated
in
order
to
board
its
ships
.
Virgin
Voyages
,
Crystal
Cruises
and
others
are
requiring
guests
to
be
vaccinated
as
well
.
These
companies
will
restart
cruise
operations
this
spring
and
summer
.
For
the
moment
,
airlines
are
not
requiring
vaccinations
for
travel
,
but
some
international
destinations
are
requiring
vaccination
for
entry
.
The
idea
has
been
much
talked
about
in
the
industry
.
In
an
interview
with
NBC
Nightly
News
,
Ed
Bastian
,
the
chief
executive
officer
of
Delta
Air
Lines
,
said
that
proof
of
vaccination
will
likely
eventually
be
required
on
international
flights
,
but
whether
that
is
paper
proof
or
a
digital
vaccine
passport
,
is
unclear.Perry
Flint
,
a
spokesman
for
the
I.A.T.A.
,
said
that
the
agency
does
not
support
a
mandatory
vaccine
requirement
for
air
travel
because
it
“
risks
discriminating
against
those
markets
where
vaccines
may
take
longer
to
become
widely
available
”
or
against
those
“
who
are
not
able
to
get
vaccinated
for
medical
reasons
,
or
who
are
unwilling
to
do
so
owing
to
ethical
or
other
concerns.
”
Still
,
the
agency
has
developed
its
own
vaccine
pass
called
Travel
Pass
,
which
travelers
can
use
to
share
Covid-related
health
information
with
governments
or
airlines
that
require
it
,
Mr.
Flint
said.In
March
,
Gov
.
Andrew
Cuomo
announced
the
launch
of
Excelsior
Pass
,
a
free
app
that
will
allow
businesses
to
scan
a
code
to
confirm
whether
someone
has
been
vaccinated
or
tested
negative
for
the
coronavirus
.
To
sign
up
,
New
York
residents
should
visit
the
Excelsior
Pass
website
,
where
they
will
be
asked
to
enter
their
name
,
date
of
birth
and
ZIP
code
.
A
pass
—
a
QR
code
that
can
be
scanned
by
businesses
—
will
automatically
be
generated
using
data
from
state
vaccination
records
or
testing
lab
data.No
one
is
required
to
download
Excelsior
Pass
,
according
to
a
spokesman
for
the
governor
’
s
office
.
The
pass
generated
on
the
website
can
be
printed
out
,
or
you
can
show
your
vaccine
card
or
evidence
of
a
negative
test
result
instead.Among
the
Biden
administration
’
s
executive
orders
aimed
at
curbing
the
pandemic
is
one
that
asked
government
agencies
to
“
assess
the
feasibility
”
of
producing
digital
versions
of
vaccination
documents
.
But
while
the
government
is
involved
in
these
efforts
,
the
administration
has
said
that
it
would
not
be
passing
a
federal
mandate
or
distributing
its
own
vaccine
passport.In
a
White
House
Covid-19
news
conference
in
March
,
Andy
Slavitt
,
a
senior
White
House
pandemic
adviser
,
said
that
“
unlike
other
parts
of
the
world
,
the
government
here
is
not
viewing
its
role
as
the
place
to
create
a
passport
,
nor
a
place
to
hold
the
data
of
citizens.
”
“
We
view
this
as
something
that
the
private
sector
is
doing
and
will
do
,
”
he
said
.
“
What
’
s
important
to
us
—
and
we
’
re
leading
an
interagency
process
right
now
to
go
through
these
details
—
are
that
some
important
criteria
be
met
with
these
credentials
,
”
including
equitable
access
and
privacy
and
security
concerns.Yes
.
Aside
from
the
health
benefits
of
getting
the
vaccine
,
there
are
also
other
perks
that
come
with
your
vaccine
card
.
Businesses
across
the
country
,
from
bars
to
marijuana
dispensaries
,
have
been
offering
perks
to
those
with
a
Covid-19
vaccination
card
.
Krispy
Kreme
,
for
instance
,
said
that
for
the
rest
of
the
year
,
it
would
give
one
free
glazed
doughnut
per
day
to
anyone
who
presents
proof
of
a
Covid-19
vaccination.Michael
Tattersfield
,
the
company
’
s
chief
executive
,
told
Fox
News
that
as
vaccinations
have
accelerated
across
the
country
,
“
We
made
the
decision
that
,
‘
Hey
,
we
can
support
the
next
act
of
joy
,
’
which
is
,
if
you
come
by
,
show
us
a
vaccine
card
,
get
a
doughnut
any
time

any
day

Check
out
our
52
Places
list
for
2021.There
is
much
to
celebrate
about
America
’
s
vaccine
rollout.The
government
bet
big
on
vaccines
,
committing
to
buying
millions
of
doses
even
before
a
vaccine
was
approved
.
Now
,
about
44
percent
of
the
United
States
population
has
been
fully
vaccinated
,
far
more
than
many
other
countries
.
While
other
nations
struggle
to
obtain
vaccines
needed
to
stop
outbreaks
,
the
United
States
has
a
surplus
,
and
is
experiencing
the
fewest
cases
,
hospitalizations
and
deaths
since
the
beginning
of
the
pandemic.Yet
for
all
of
the
American
successes
,
100,000
people
have
died
from
the
virus
since
February
,
after
vaccine
distribution
was
well
underway
.
Many
more
have
been
infected
and
could
face
long-term
medical
problems
.
As
the
nation
reopens
and
calls
emerge
to
investigate
lessons
learned
in
the
pandemic
,
The
New
York
Times
asked
more
than
a
dozen
public
health
experts
,
economists
and
bioethicists
to
reflect
on
the
vaccine
rollout
.
Was
the
American
approach
as
effective
as
it
could
have
been
?
What
,
if
anything
,
could
have
been
done
differently
?
The
Trump
and
Biden
administrations
debated
numerous
options
,
including
ideas
raised
by
the
experts
.
There
is
by
no
means
universal
agreement
about
what
should
have
been
done
,
and
no
way
of
knowing
with
certainty
whether
different
vaccination
tactics
would
have
resulted
in
fewer
deaths
.
Still
,
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight
,
experts
pointed
to
several
areas
where
the
United
States
might
have
taken
another
approach
.
Here
are
five
alternate
scenarios
:
By
now
,
most
people
are
familiar
with
the
Pfizer
and
Moderna
timelines
:
An
initial
dose
of
the
vaccine
,
followed
by
a
second
shot
three
to
four
weeks
later.Some
experts
suggest
that
the
United
States
could
have
delayed
second
doses
of
the
vaccine
for
several
weeks
and
instead
given
out
first
shots
more
widely
to
high
risk
people
,
in
order
to
give
some
protection
to
more
people
.
One
dose
of
the
Pfizer
or
Moderna
vaccine
offers
80
percent
protection
after
two
weeks
,
compared
with
90
percent
from
two
doses
,
according
to
a
federal
report
on
efficacy
under
real
world
conditions
.
(
The
Johnson
&
Johnson
vaccine
,
which
was
authorized
later
,
comes
in
a
single
shot
.
)
“
We
spent
a
lot
of
February
providing
a
lot
of
second
shots
to
people
who
had
gotten
their
first
shot
in
January
,
when
there
were
a
ton
of
high
risk
people
getting
infected
and
dying
,
for
whom
a
single
shot
would
have
made
a
big
difference
,
”
said
Dr.
Ashish
Jha
,
dean
of
the
Brown
University
School
of
Public
Health.The
delayed
shot
approach
,
which
had
not
been
rigorously
tested
,
particularly
over
time
and
against
virus
variants
,
was
hotly
debated
.
Federal
officials
ultimately
deemed
it
too
risky
,
and
Dr.
Anthony
S.
Fauci
,
America
’
s
top
infectious
disease
expert
,
said
he
was
opposed.The
approach
,
though
experimental
,
was
used
in
Britain
,
where
officials
delayed
second
shots
by
up
to
12
weeks
.
(
Britain
also
organized
its
rollout
largely
by
age
,
starting
with
the
oldest
most
likely
to
die
from
the
virus
and
continuing
in
descending
order
.
)
Deaths
in
Britain
have
plummeted
—
the
country
recently
recorded
a
day
with
zero
new
deaths
—
and
a
recent
study
reported
an
intriguing
finding
:
People
who
received
the
second
shot
12
weeks
later
actually
produced
more
antibodies
than
those
who
received
their
second
shot
after
three
weeks
.
Still
,
Britain
has
seen
a
rise
in
cases
in
recent
weeks
and
is
now
accelerating
second
doses
in
order
to
combat
an
outbreak
of
the
Delta
variant
,
which
is
more
contagious
and
more
likely
to
infect
people
who
have
had
only
one
shot
.
Some
people
have
argued
that
the
nation
should
have
prioritized
people
who
were
most
likely
to
spread
the
virus
,
rather
than
those
most
vulnerable
to
dying
from
it
.
(
Indonesia
tried
vaccinating
younger
people
first
.
)
But
the
experts
we
spoke
with
generally
said
that
the
United
States
was
wise
to
prioritize
older
people
,
who
have
died
from
Covid
at
much
higher
rates
.
“
If
our
goal
is
to
save
the
most
lives
,
we
need
to
think
about
who
is
most
likely
to
die
,
”
said
Nancy
Jecker
,
a
professor
of
bioethics
at
the
University
of
Washington
School
of
Medicine
.
“
Age
is
a
pretty
reliable
predictor.
”
Indeed
,
since
vaccinations
began
,
deaths
among
people
75
and
older
have
fallen
substantially
,
with
particular
progress
in
nursing
homes.While
doses
were
initially
in
short
supply
and
many
seniors
faced
problems
accessing
the
vaccine
,
some
experts
said
opening
shots
to
a
slightly
wider
group
could
have
brought
equity
,
arguing
that
higher
age
cutoffs
benefited
white
Americans
,
who
have
a
longer
life
expectancy
than
their
Black
peers
.
When
states
opened
up
eligibility
to
the
general
population
,
some
began
with
a
threshold
of
75
or
80
,
while
many
went
with
a
cutoff
of
65
and
older
.
“
Even
at
the
beginning
,
we
should
have
started
at
60
and
above
,
or
65
and
above
at
least
,
”
said
Saad
Omer
,
director
of
the
Yale
Institute
for
Global
Health.In
recent
months
,
people
aged
50
to
64
have
made
up
a
growing
share
of
Covid
deaths
,
underscoring
the
remaining
risk
to
this
slightly
younger
group
when
unvaccinated.Ruth
Faden
,
founder
of
the
Johns
Hopkins
Berman
Institute
of
Bioethics
,
also
favored
lowering
the
age
limit
to
protect
older
people
in
communities
of
color
or
with
lower
incomes.
“
It
is
not
only
how
many
lives
,
”
she
said
,
“
but
whose
lives.
”
Again
and
again
,
experts
raised
the
issue
of
vaccine
equity
as
an
area
in
which
the
United
States
fell
short.Across
much
of
America
,
the
lowest-income
neighborhoods
logged
some
of
the
highest
per
capita
rates
of
Covid
cases
and
deaths
—
and
the
lowest
rates
of
vaccination
.
Black
and
Hispanic
Americans
,
who
have
been
at
higher
risk
of
being
infected
and
of
dying
from
Covid-19
compared
with
white
Americans
,
have
received
the
vaccine
at
lower
rates
.
And
,
according
to
a
U.S.
census
survey
released
last
month
,
among
Americans
open
to
being
vaccinated
,
the
higher
a
person
’
s
household
income
,
the
more
likely
the
person
was
to
have
received
a
shot
.
Of
30
million
“
willing
but
not
yet
vaccinated
’
'
people
,
more
than
80
percent
did
not
have
a
college
degree
,
according
to
an
analysis
of
the
census
data.To
address
socioeconomic
equity
,
the
C.D.C
.
recommended
prioritizing
what
it
called
“
frontline
essential
workers
,
”
including
grocery
and
transit
workers
.
But
that
proved
too
complicated
for
many
states
,
and
some
experts
said
the
C.D.C
.
should
have
pushed
for
a
more
direct
approach
,
such
as
targeting
disadvantaged
areas
,
a
tactic
that
was
tried
in
a
limited
number
of
places
.
“
We
could
have
been
more
intentional
about
planning
to
avoid
those
disparities
,
”
said
Dr
.
Jewel
Mullen
,
associate
dean
for
health
equity
at
Dell
Medical
School
.
“
The
maps
we
had
last
spring
and
summer
showed
where
people
were
dying
and
that
could
have
been
good
enough
to
say
,
‘
We
know
where
we
need
to
go
with
vaccines.
’
”
One
data
analysis
by
researchers
at
the
University
of
Texas
at
Austin
suggests
that
it
would
have
been
possible
to
save
lives
simply
by
targeting
vaccines
early
on
to
the
ZIP
codes
hardest-hit
by
Covid-19
.
In
Austin
,
as
in
many
places
,
those
same
ZIP
codes
are
also
the
poorest
.
Such
a
strategy
might
not
have
been
politically
tenable
,
but
Lauren
Ancel
Meyers
,
the
epidemic
modeler
who
conducted
the
study
,
said
it
likely
would
have
prevented
some
hospitalizations
and
deaths
across
the
whole
city.After
swiftly
passing
more
than
$
2
trillion
in
three
separate
bills
in
March
2020
,
Congress
haggled
for
months
over
the
details
of
more
legislation
to
address
the
pandemic
and
needs
across
the
country
.
A
final
package
,
including
billions
of
dollars
for
vaccine
distribution
,
did
not
become
law
until
just
after
Christmas
—
after
the
Pfizer
and
Moderna
vaccines
had
already
been
authorized
for
emergency
use.
“
Had
that
money
come
earlier
,
yes
,
health
departments
could
have
scaled
up
operations
earlier
and
that
could
have
made
a
difference
,
”
said
Dr.
Adam
Gaffney
,
an
assistant
professor
at
Harvard
Medical
School
and
a
pulmonary
specialist.At
the
same
time
,
the
early
rollout
was
chaotic
at
a
critical
moment
,
when
more
than
2,000
people
were
dying
every
day
.
Logistical
bottlenecks
meant
that
available
shots
were
not
immediately
delivered
into
people
’
s
arms
,
said
Dr.
Nathaniel
Hupert
,
a
physician
and
public
health
researcher
at
Weill
Cornell
Medicine
.
Such
delays
were
tantamount
to
losing
the
benefits
of
compound
interest
in
your
savings
account
,
he
said.When
a
polio
vaccine
became
available
in
the
United
States
in
the
1950s
,
the
March
of
Dimes
,
an
organization
that
had
been
affiliated
with
President
Franklin
D.
Roosevelt
,
made
a
major
advertising
push
,
with
posters
featuring
young
children
who
were
most
at
risk
of
being
infected
,
recalled
René
Najera
,
editor
of
the
History
of
Vaccines
project
at
the
College
of
Physicians
of
Philadelphia
.
To
boost
public
interest
in
the
vaccine
,
Elvis
Presley
got
vaccinated
backstage
at
“
The
Ed
Sullivan
Show.
”
“
It
was
seen
as
a
patriotic
thing
,
”
Dr.
Najera
said
.
Today
,
the
government
has
planned
public
education
efforts
,
but
the
issue
has
remained
fragmented
and
divisive
.
Former
President
Donald
J.
Trump
,
whose
administration
had
arguably
its
biggest
success
of
the
pandemic
in
quickly
producing
vaccines
,
did
not
use
his
political
stardom
to
convince
skeptical
members
of
his
base
.
He
got
vaccinated
in
private
before
leaving
the
White
House
,
and
today
,
Republicans
remain
less
likely
than
Democrats
to
get
vaccinated
.
The
Biden
administration
has
been
vocal
in
its
support
for
vaccines
,
but
has
also
been
unable
to
overcome
hesitancy
on
the
part
of
many
Americans
,
including
some
who
are
skeptical
of
government
authority
,
and
others
who
are
suspicious
of
a
medical
establishment
because
of
its
record
of
racial
inequity
.
The
country
appears
likely
to
fall
just
short
of
President
Biden
’
s
goal
of
having
70
percent
of
adults
at
least
partly
vaccinated
by
July
4.Debra
Furr-Holden
,
associate
dean
for
public
health
integration
at
Michigan
State
University
,
attributed
at
least
some
of
the
resistance
to
communications
failures
,
starting
with
the
branding
of
Operation
Warp
Speed
,
the
federal
effort
to
develop
a
coronavirus
vaccine
quickly
.
“
When
people
heard
‘
warp
speed
,
’
you
know
what
they
heard
?
Corner
cutting
,
skipped
steps
,
missed
steps
,
quick
and
dirty
,
”
she
said.She
said
the
United
States
should
have
launched
a
mass
literacy
campaign
on
vaccines
long
before
they
were
produced
and
made
it
far
easier
to
get
vaccinated
once
shots
were
available
.
“
We
should
be
vaccinating
people
on
their
front
doorsteps
,
”
she
said
.
Basic
information
about
vaccine
delivery
,
like
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
was
footing
the
bill
,
was
also
often
in
short
supply
,
said
Dr.
Rebecca
Weintraub
,
a
vaccinator
and
assistant
professor
at
Harvard
Medical
School.
“
People
would
be
constantly
coming
up
bringing
piles
of
identification
and
cash
,
”
Dr.
Weintraub
said
.
“
We
should
have
had
massive
billboards
from
the
beginning
:
‘
THE
VACCINE
IS
FREE
,
YOU
DON
’
T
NEED
AN
I.D.
’
’
’
And
then
there
is
the
cool
factor
.
Not
everyone
will
be
convinced
by
health
facts
and
testimony
from
experts
like
Dr.
Fauci
,
said
Stacy
Wood
,
a
marketing
professor
at
North
Carolina
State
University
,
who
has
examined
how
to
market
to
people
who
are
disinterested
,
but
not
opposed
,
to
the
vaccine
.
“
Instead
of
top
experts
,
you
might
give
them
celebrities
,
”
she
said
—
and
a
variety
of
celebrities
at
that
.
“
Even
Elvis
Presley
didn
’
t
convince
everyone.
”
The
White
House
said
on
Wednesday
that
the
United
States
would
send
three
million
doses
of
Johnson
&
Johnson
’
s
vaccine
to
Brazil
on
Thursday
.
The
country
’
s
virus
cases
and
fatalities
are
surging
again
,
with
a
death
toll
above
500,000.Less
than
a
third
of
the
country
’
s
population
has
had
at
least
one
shot
,
and
an
average
of
74,490
new
cases
per
day
were
reported
in
the
country
in
the
last
week
—
an
increase
of
26
percent
from
the
average
two
weeks
ago.The
vaccines
,
which
are
set
to
arrive
in
Campinas
,
near
São
Paulo
,
are
part
of
President
Biden
’
s
pledge
to
dispatch
80
million
doses
overseas
by
the
end
of
the
month
,
a
White
House
official
said
.
The
official
added
that
“
scientific
teams
and
legal
and
regulatory
authorities
”
from
the
United
States
and
Brazil
had
worked
to
secure
the
arrangement.The
shipment
to
Brazil
follows
one
to
Taiwan
last
weekend
:
2.5
million
doses
of
Moderna
’
s
vaccine
.
Mr.
Biden
,
who
has
been
under
intense
pressure
to
increase
his
vaccine
commitments
abroad
,
announced
this
month
that
his
administration
would
buy
500
million
doses
of
the
Pfizer-BioNTech
vaccine
and
distribute
them
among
about
100
countries
over
the
next
year.Asked
last
week
at
a
pandemic
news
conference
whether
the
administration
would
send
vaccines
to
Brazil
,
Jeffrey
D.
Zients
,
the
White
House
Covid-19
response
coordinator
,
said
that
the
United
States
was
working
with
other
countries
on
complicated
logistical
issues
,
including
securing
needles
,
syringes
and
alcohol
pads
that
would
accompany
the
medicine.The
Johnson
&
Johnson
vaccine
,
which
confers
a
high
level
of
protection
against
virus
cases
,
hospitalizations
and
deaths
,
has
faced
sagging
demand
in
the
United
States
.
The
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
and
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
in
April
recommended
a
pause
in
its
use
after
reports
of
a
rare
blood-clotting
disorder
in
a
small
number
of
people
who
had
received
the
vaccine
,
a
decision
that
state
officials
said
had
derailed
interest
in
the
shot.And
with
manufacturing
problems
at
a
Baltimore
plant
operated
by
a
subcontractor
,
Emergent
BioSolutions
,
Johnson
&
Johnson
has
been
able
to
deliver
fewer
than
half
of
the
100
million
doses
it
promised
the
federal
government
by
the
end
of
this
month
.
A
little
more
than
half
the
Johnson
&
Johnson
doses
delivered
to
states
so
far
have
been
administered
,
according
to
C.D.C
.
data.Roughly
two-thirds
of
the
doses
the
U.S.
is
sending
to
Brazil
are
from
a
federal
pool
that
holds
vaccines
that
states
choose
not
to
order
,
the
White
House
said
.
Around
a
third
of
them
were
produced
at
Emergent
and
recently
cleared
by
the
F.D.A
.
in
a
special
review
of
the
facility
and
the
doses
produced
there
.
Earlier
this
month
,
the
F.D.A
.
cleared
around
10
million
doses
for
use
in
the
United
States
or
for
export
,
with
a
proviso
that
regulators
could
not
guarantee
that
Emergent
had
adhered
to
manufacturing
standards.Last
week
,
the
agency
released
another
15
million
doses
from
Emergent
.
It
is
still
reviewing
other
batches
of
the
vaccine
to
determine
if
they
are
safe
.
A
decision
is
expected
soon.Millions
of
people
in
Brazil
are
missing
their
second
doses
of
Covid-19
vaccine
,
further
complicating
a
campaign
already
marred
by
supply
shortages
and
allegations
of
graft.Some
4.1
million
Brazilians
had
not
returned
for
their
second
shot
as
of
June
1
,
according
to
data
compiled
by
researchers
who
are
following
the
vaccine
rollout
.
This
represents
nearly
16
percent
of
those
eligible
for
a
second
dose.The
reasons
for
people
missing
their
second
dose
are
varied
,
but
experts
warn
that
a
large
number
of
people
with
only
partial
protection
could
set
back
Brazil
’
s
already
troubled
vaccination
effort
.
The
coronavirus
has
killed
more
than
500,000
people
in
Brazil
,
the
second-highest
known
toll
in
the
world
after
the
United
States
,
and
daily
cases
are
hitting
new
peaks
.
About
a
third
of
the
population
has
received
at
least
one
dose
,
and
less
than
12
percent
are
fully
immunized.
“
Many
of
these
people
will
likely
have
to
be
vaccinated
again
”
with
the
first
dose
,
said
Dr.
Ligia
Bahia
,
a
public
health
specialist
at
the
Federal
University
of
Rio
de
Janeiro
and
one
of
the
researchers
leading
the
study
of
vaccinations
.
“
And
cases
will
not
fall
in
the
meantime.
”
One
reason
that
so
many
people
have
missed
their
second
shot
is
Brazil
’
s
chaotic
vaccination
rollout
,
Dr.
Bahia
said
.
Many
local
and
state
authorities
opened
up
immunizations
too
quickly
to
groups
that
were
not
at
high
risk
for
infection
,
when
not
enough
doses
were
available
,
she
said.
“
The
euphoria
of
the
vaccination
is
not
in
line
with
the
reality
of
the
supply
,
”
she
said
.
“
They
wanted
to
speed
up
,
to
say
,
‘
We
’
re
vaccinating
!
’
But
some
people
were
left
behind.
”
Brazil
has
manufactured
much
of
its
vaccine
supply
domestically
,
using
materials
shipped
from
China
to
churn
out
the
CoronaVac
vaccine
developed
by
the
Chinese
company
Sinovac
Biotech
.
In
March
,
Brazil
’
s
health
ministry
released
supplies
that
it
had
initially
planned
to
reserve
as
second
doses
for
priority
groups
,
such
as
health
workers
,
older
people
and
those
with
pre-existing
illnesses.Soon
after
that
,
delays
in
shipments
from
China
badly
curbed
supplies
,
just
as
more
people
in
Brazil
were
due
to
receive
their
second
doses.
“
Some
people
didn
’
t
get
their
second
dose
because
they
searched
and
searched
—
and
eventually
gave
up
on
being
vaccinated
,
”
said
Dr.
Alberto
Chebabo
,
vice
president
of
the
Brazilian
Society
of
Infectious
Diseases
.
“
That
’
s
a
lost
opportunity.
”
Others
in
Brazil
are
misinformed
,
he
added
,
believing
they
are
protected
after
one
shot
.
Health
experts
warn
that
a
single
dose
is
not
enough
,
especially
in
Brazil
.
The
country
has
mostly
relied
on
the
vaccine
from
Sinovac
,
which
may
not
be
as
effective
as
others
in
preventing
serious
cases
of
Covid-19
.
A
study
in
Chile
showed
that
Sinovac
was
only
36
percent
effective
in
preventing
hospitalizations
after
one
shot
.
Hundreds
of
doctors
in
Indonesia
who
received
two
Sinovac
doses
became
ill
with
Covid-19
anyway
,
and
at
least
20
died.Brazil
’
s
inoculation
troubles
have
been
mounting
.
Cities
across
the
country
are
halting
vaccinations
as
supplies
dry
up
.
Federal
prosecutors
also
launched
an
investigation
last
week
into
a
government
deal
to
buy
20
million
doses
of
Covaxin
,
a
vaccine
produced
in
India
,
at
inflated
prices.Lawmakers
are
investigating
President
Jair
Bolsonaro
’
s
handling
of
the
pandemic
,
including
his
decision
to
ignore
multiple
early
offers
to
buy
vaccines
from
drugmakers
like
Pfizer
,
as
he
played
down
the
danger
posed
by
the
virus
and
promoted
“
miracle
cures
”
now
proven
to
be
ineffective.More
than
150
staff
members
at
a
Houston-area
hospital
were
fired
or
resigned
on
Tuesday
for
not
following
a
policy
that
requires
employees
to
be
vaccinated
against
Covid-19.The
hospital
,
Houston
Methodist
,
had
told
employees
that
they
had
to
be
vaccinated
by
June
7
or
face
suspension
for
two
weeks
.
Of
the
nearly
200
employees
who
had
been
suspended
,
153
of
them
were
terminated
by
the
hospital
on
Tuesday
or
had
resigned
,
according
to
Gale
Smith
,
a
spokeswoman
for
the
hospital.Ms
.
Smith
said
employees
who
had
complied
with
the
vaccine
policy
during
the
suspension
period
were
allowed
to
return
to
work
a
day
after
they
became
compliant.The
hospital
did
not
specify
how
many
workers
had
complied
and
returned
to
work.Vaccine
hesitancy
has
been
high
among
frontline
health
care
workers
:
Surveys
showed
that
nearly
half
remained
unvaccinated
as
of
mid-March
,
despite
being
among
the
first
to
become
eligible
for
the
shots
in
December
.
A
March
2021
survey
by
the
Kaiser
Family
Foundation
found
that
health
care
workers
had
concerns
about
the
vaccines
’
newness
and
their
possible
side
effects
,
both
of
which
are
common
reasons
for
waiting
to
be
vaccinated.Earlier
this
month
,
dozens
of
employees
who
had
not
been
vaccinated
by
Houston
Methodist
’
s
deadline
protested
outside
of
the
hospital
against
the
mandatory
vaccine
policy.The
protest
followed
a
now
dismissed
lawsuit
filed
last
month
by
117
Houston
Methodist
employees
against
their
employer
over
the
vaccine
policy
.
The
workers
’
lawsuit
accused
the
hospital
of
“
forcing
its
employees
to
be
human
‘
guinea
pigs
’
as
a
condition
for
continued
employment.
”
Jennifer
Bridges
,
a
nurse
who
led
the
Houston
Methodist
protest
,
had
cited
the
lack
of
full
F.D.A
.
approval
for
the
shots
as
a
reason
she
wouldn
’
t
get
vaccinated.U.S
.
District
Judge
Lynn
N.
Hughes
,
in
the
Southern
District
of
Texas
,
rejected
a
claim
by
Ms.
Bridges
,
the
lead
plaintiff
in
the
lawsuit
,
that
the
vaccines
available
for
use
in
the
United
States
were
experimental
and
dangerous.
“
The
hospital
’
s
employees
are
not
participants
in
a
human
trial
,
”
Judge
Hughes
wrote
.
“
Methodist
is
trying
to
do
their
business
of
saving
lives
without
giving
them
the
Covid-19
virus
.
It
is
a
choice
made
to
keep
staff
,
patients
and
their
families
safer.
”
Arthur
Caplan
,
a
professor
of
medical
ethics
at
the
New
York
University
Grossman
School
of
Medicine
,
said
the
vaccine
requirement
was
no
different
than
other
mandates
for
health
care
workers
,
like
getting
an
annual
flu
shot
,
keeping
up
with
immunizations
and
wearing
hairnets.He
noted
that
some
health
care
workers
have
been
fired
in
the
past
for
refusing
to
get
flu
shots
and
said
that
states
like
New
York
require
it.
“
Health
care
workers
have
three
special
ethical
responsibilities
,
”
Dr.
Caplan
said
.
“
One
is
protect
the
vulnerable
,
people
who
are
really
at
risk
of
a
disease
.
Secondly
,
put
patient
interests
for
first
.
It
doesn
’
t
say
,
‘
put
your
choice
first.
’
Third
,
they
’
re
supposed
to
do
no
harm.
”
Dr
.
Caplan
also
condemned
a
comparison
by
the
lead
plaintiff
in
the
Houston
case
,
Ms.
Bridges
,
between
hospital
workers
and
Nazi
concentration
camp
prisoners.He
suggested
that
the
hospital
employees
who
refused
to
get
vaccinated
would
be
better
off
in
a
different
line
of
work.
“
It
’
s
like
you
’
re
in
the
wrong
job
there
,
buddy
,
”
he
said.Record
profits
warranted
record
bonuses
.
That
was
the
recommendation
in
January
by
executives
at
the
biotech
firm
Emergent
BioSolutions
.
The
board
of
directors
agreed
,
signing
off
on
nearly
$
8
million
in
cash
and
stock
awards
for
five
company
leaders.The
bonuses
arrived
this
spring
even
as
Congress
was
investigating
the
company
’
s
production
of
Covid-19
vaccines
in
Baltimore
,
where
manufacturing
mistakes
have
rendered
75
million
doses
unusable
and
forced
a
two-month-long
shutdown
of
operations.Emergent
has
nonetheless
enjoyed
the
best
financial
year
in
its
two-decade
history
,
thanks
largely
to
the
government
’
s
largess
and
decision
to
sidestep
the
usual
contracting
rules
,
interviews
and
previously
undisclosed
documents
show.Without
seeking
competitive
bids
,
federal
officials
in
May
2020
not
only
committed
to
reserve
production
space
at
the
troubled
Baltimore
plant
,
but
also
booked
two
Emergent
facilities
nearby
to
bottle
and
package
vaccines
and
coronavirus
drugs
.
Regulators
have
criticized
those
sites
for
quality
shortcomings
in
recent
years
,
according
to
previously
unreported
inspections
,
including
one
just
this
April
when
health
investigators
found
that
a
factory
was
not
taking
adequate
steps
to
prevent
contamination.The
two
additional
facilities
have
seen
little
use
,
while
the
company
has
collected
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
in
fees
for
keeping
production
lines
largely
on
standby
—
with
“
minimal
costs
”
to
the
company
,
Emergent
’
s
chief
financial
officer
said
to
investors
last
summer.The
lucrative
agreement
with
Emergent
reflects
the
early
chaotic
days
of
the
pandemic
when
the
Trump
administration
was
engaged
in
what
one
government
official
called
“
panic
buying
”
with
little
outside
scrutiny.Emergent
was
in
a
good
position
to
benefit
.
A
longtime
federal
contractor
based
in
Gaithersburg
,
Md.
,
the
company
had
effectively
cornered
the
market
for
federal
biodefense
contracts
,
building
a
successful
business
over
the
past
two
decades
atop
its
sales
of
anthrax
vaccines
to
the
nation
’
s
emergency
medical
stockpile
,
The
New
York
Times
reported
in
March.Even
though
it
had
never
won
regulatory
approval
to
mass-produce
anything
at
its
main
Baltimore
plant
,
the
politically
connected
company
was
tasked
with
making
two
Covid-19
vaccines
there.The
Times
previously
disclosed
contamination
problems
with
that
vaccine
production
,
but
the
new
documents
and
interviews
show
the
government
also
enlisted
the
two
other
Emergent
facilities
despite
a
record
of
quality
concerns
.
Taken
together
,
payments
for
the
three
plants
helped
propel
the
company
to
its
banner
year.Emergent
and
the
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
told
The
Times
that
the
generous
deal
was
meant
to
compensate
Emergent
for
giving
up
other
work
at
the
three
plants
.
The
government
’
s
cost
“
was
based
on
the
comparable
reservation
fees
that
commercial
parties
were
willing
to
pay
if
Emergent
had
contracted
with
them
,
”
the
company
said
in
a
statement
.
“
Suggestions
that
Emergent
improperly
inflated
prices
are
not
accurate.
”
But
a
review
of
the
company
’
s
filings
with
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
shows
that
its
entire
contract
manufacturing
business
,
which
includes
the
three
Maryland
factories
and
others
elsewhere
,
had
never
brought
in
anything
close
to
the
amount
the
federal
government
paid
in
2020
.
Those
payments
exceeded
the
revenue
the
company
had
earned
from
all
of
its
contract
manufacturing
in
the
previous
three
years
combined.The
2020
agreement
with
the
government
,
which
was
among
the
documents
recently
made
public
by
congressional
investigators
,
promised
Emergent
$
542
million
to
reserve
the
three
plants
for
periods
ranging
from
three
to
20
months
.
Until
last
week
,
the
suspended
factory
in
Baltimore
’
s
Bayview
section
had
failed
to
deliver
a
single
usable
vaccine
dose
for
distribution
in
the
United
States
,
and
then
only
with
a
special
warning
from
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
.
In
addition
,
the
production
lines
at
the
two
other
sites
—
in
the
Camden
section
of
Baltimore
and
in
Rockville
,
Md
.
—
have
mostly
sat
idle.A
memo
from
June
last
year
suggests
that
the
government
paid
to
reserve
substantially
more
capacity
at
the
Camden
plant
than
Emergent
had
used
the
previous
year
for
its
commercial
clients
.
Carlo
de
Notaristefani
,
the
Trump
and
Biden
administrations
’
top
manufacturing
expert
for
the
pandemic
response
,
wrote
that
the
Camden
plant
had
bottled
about
three
million
vials
of
pharmaceuticals
in
2019
.
The
government
reserved
enough
space
to
bottle
about
4.3
million
vials
on
an
annual
basis
,
more
than
a
40
percent
increase
in
business.A
half-dozen
industry
executives
and
consultants
said
the
terms
of
Emergent
’
s
deal
would
be
highly
unusual
among
private
companies
.
Typically
,
a
customer
pays
part
of
the
manufacturing
cost
up
front
and
the
rest
when
the
job
is
done
,
they
said
.
But
in
Emergent
’
s
case
,
the
government
agreed
to
pay
the
full
estimated
cost
of
manufacturing
even
if
none
took
place.As
some
other
companies
vied
for
similar
bottling
and
packaging
work
in
a
competitive
bidding
process
,
the
federal
health
officials
skirted
regular
contracting
rules
and
appended
the
new
business
to
an
existing
deal
with
Emergent
made
eight
years
earlier
,
documents
show
.
While
not
the
norm
,
such
amendments
are
sometimes
used
to
expedite
contracts.Under
the
agreement
,
the
Trump
administration
agreed
to
set
aside
$
97
million
to
reserve
two
production
lines
at
the
Camden
plant
that
Mr.
de
Notaristefani
soon
after
characterized
as
out
of
date
and
capable
of
handling
only
small
volumes
of
Covid-19
drugs
.
The
two
lines
,
booked
through
the
end
of
this
year
,
have
been
used
only
“
sparingly
,
”
according
to
a
senior
health
department
official
who
spoke
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
to
discuss
what
the
agency
called
sensitive
contracting
issues.Health
department
officials
declined
to
specify
how
many
vials
Emergent
had
bottled
for
the
government
,
saying
only
that
it
had
performed
some
of
that
work
on
Covid-19
treatments
developed
by
Humanigen
and
Regeneron
Pharmaceuticals.Another
$
16
million
reserved
a
small
bottling
line
for
five
months
at
the
Rockville
plant
.
The
line
has
never
been
used
,
apparently
because
vaccine
developers
have
preferred
partners
that
can
handle
bigger
volumes
,
according
to
two
federal
officials.In
addition
,
the
government
committed
$
78
million
for
Emergent
to
build
a
new
production
line
in
Rockville
and
nearly
$
10
million
to
reserve
it
for
the
last
three
months
of
this
year
,
when
it
is
expected
to
be
completed.A
cornerstone
of
Operation
Warp
Speed
,
the
Trump
administration
’
s
Covid-19
initiative
,
was
to
pay
for
large-scale
manufacturing
of
promising
vaccines
or
therapeutics
,
even
if
they
might
fail
in
clinical
trials
.
The
government
went
beyond
those
terms
with
its
Emergent
deal
,
however
,
agreeing
to
pay
the
company
regardless
of
whether
it
produced
anything.Two
senior
health
department
officials
,
speaking
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
,
said
the
deal
was
necessary
to
prepare
for
unexpected
developments
throughout
the
pandemic
.
At
least
one
other
company
was
also
paid
for
backup
manufacturing
capacity
that
turned
out
to
be
unnecessary
,
they
said.After
awarding
Emergent
the
no-bid
contract
,
the
Trump
administration
reverted
to
traditional
contracting
rules
and
sought
competitive
proposals
for
additional
bottling
and
packaging
,
known
in
the
industry
as
fill-finish
work
,
the
documents
show
.
Ology
Bioservices
,
based
in
Alachua
,
Fla.
,
agreed
to
provide
essentially
the
same
services
as
Emergent
’
s
Camden
and
Rockville
plants
for
three-quarters
to
nearly
one-third
of
the
cost
,
according
to
a
calculation
based
on
the
contracts.Under
an
agreement
reached
in
August
,
Ology
would
charge
the
government
fees
equating
to
$
6.83
per
vial
.
By
comparison
,
Emergent
’
s
existing
lines
would
cost
it
between
$
9.03
and
$
18.40
a
vial.A
health
department
spokeswoman
said
Ology
was
cheaper
in
part
because
it
can
bottle
more
than
100,000
vials
in
a
single
batch
,
as
much
as
five
times
what
Emergent
can
handle
.
That
“
lowers
the
per
vial
price
by
spreading
the
fixed
costs
over
more
vials
,
”
she
said
in
an
email.Even
after
bringing
on
Ology
,
the
government
has
continued
its
agreement
with
Emergent
,
at
the
higher
cost
,
to
ensure
“
additional
capacity
is
available
if
or
when
needed
to
fill
vaccines
or
therapeutics
,
”
she
said
.
At
the
time
of
the
contract
,
former
and
current
federal
officials
said
,
the
government
wanted
to
secure
as
much
manufacturing
power
as
possible
before
commercial
ventures
snapped
it
up.Over
the
years
,
Emergent
has
grown
by
getting
the
government
to
fund
expansions
of
its
manufacturing
sites
and
amass
reserves
of
its
products.In
November
2019
,
the
company
announced
a
plan
to
double
its
revenue
,
in
part
by
expanding
its
contract
manufacturing
business
.
A
senior
vice
president
,
Syed
Husain
,
outlined
a
“
game
plan
”
that
included
“
cross-selling
additional
services
”
to
existing
customers
,
including
the
federal
government
.
Six
months
later
,
Emergent
struck
the
deal
that
broadened
its
existing
government
contract
to
include
work
at
the
Camden
and
Rockville
sites.Dr
.
Robert
Kadlec
,
a
former
Trump
administration
official
who
oversaw
the
agency
that
awarded
Covid-19
contracts
,
had
previously
worked
as
a
consultant
for
Emergent
.
Dr.
Kadlec
has
said
that
he
did
not
negotiate
the
Emergent
deal
but
did
approve
it
.
Emergent
said
it
negotiated
the
agreement
with
career
government
officials.In
the
case
of
Camden
,
the
government
stood
by
the
payments
despite
concerns
raised
by
Mr.
de
Notaristefani
,
its
manufacturing
expert.After
visiting
the
Camden
plant
last
year
,
he
wrote
that
its
production
lines
were
“
obsolete
”
and
relied
too
heavily
on
manual
labor
instead
of
automated
systems
,
heightening
the
risk
of
contamination
.
If
the
government
turned
to
the
plant
,
he
wrote
,
a
new
line
,
then
under
construction
,
“
should
be
used
exclusively.
”
The
two
senior
health
department
officials
said
Mr.
de
Notaristefani
’
s
concerns
were
noted
but
did
not
warrant
changing
the
contract
.
“
Folks
can
walk
through
the
site
and
say
,
‘
Oh
,
wow
,
this
equipment
was
state
of
the
art
20
years
ago
,
’
”
one
of
them
said
.
“
But
I
can
also
walk
through
many
sites
for
many
biopharmaceutical
companies
out
there
and
say
exactly
the
same
thing.
”
Nor
were
officials
unduly
concerned
by
F.D.A
.
inspection
reports
that
cited
quality
control
problems
,
which
have
also
plagued
Emergent
’
s
Baltimore
vaccine-making
factory
.
While
the
fill-finish
process
draws
far
less
notice
than
the
production
of
vaccines
and
therapeutics
,
it
is
highly
sophisticated
and
tightly
regulated
because
violations
of
manufacturing
standards
pose
a
risk
of
harming
the
public.The
regulatory
reports
,
obtained
by
The
Times
,
detail
a
series
of
failings
at
the
Camden
plant
over
the
past
seven
years
,
the
most
serious
of
which
were
identified
in
2018
.
The
manufacturing
for
one
pharmaceutical
product
was
“
not
within
a
state
of
control
,
”
inspectors
found
,
noting
a
recurring
issue
with
broken
vials
.
They
wrote
that
the
facility
was
“
not
maintained
in
a
good
state
of
repair
,
”
and
that
its
crowded
setup
increased
the
risk
of
mixing
up
materials.A
follow-up
inspection
in
2019
found
Emergent
had
corrected
those
issues
.
But
this
April
,
investigators
returned
to
the
factory
and
noted
similar
problems
,
including
cracked
vials
and
employees
who
were
not
following
procedures
meant
to
prevent
contamination.Regulators
had
observed
similar
issues
at
the
Rockville
plant
in
2019
,
criticizing
Emergent
for
failing
to
properly
control
contamination
there
,
too
.
Employees
who
discovered
particulates
or
defects
in
vials
discarded
them
but
did
not
try
to
identify
the
underlying
causes
,
the
inspector
noted
,
and
on
two
occasions
,
hair
was
found
on
equipment.
“
Your
firm
has
not
implemented
any
investigations
or
corrective
actions
for
the
low-level
molds
recoveries
which
continue
to
be
found
within
the
manufacturing
facility
,
”
the
inspector
wrote
,
repeating
almost
verbatim
a
finding
from
the
previous
year
’
s
inspection
of
the
Camden
site.One
of
the
health
department
officials
said
that
none
of
the
issues
was
“
so
dramatic
that
it
changed
our
assessment
”
that
the
facilities
were
“
fit
for
purpose
and
in
a
state
of
compliance.
”
Matt
Hartwig
,
a
spokesman
for
Emergent
,
said
the
company
“
takes
all
FDA
observations
seriously
and
works
expeditiously
to
address
them.
”
In
interviews
with
The
Times
,
two
former
employees
who
helped
enforce
quality
control
at
the
Rockville
plant
said
that
Emergent
managers
regularly
played
down
deviations
from
manufacturing
standards.One
of
them
,
Matthew
Witmer
,
was
a
quality
investigator
at
Rockville
from
June
last
year
to
January.
“
They
were
sugarcoating
their
deviations
,
”
he
said
.
“
They
would
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
,
‘
We
know
that
this
is
one
of
the
root
causes
,
but
we
’
re
not
focusing
on
that.
’
”
In
the
end
,
Mr.
Witmer
said
,
the
plant
was
trying
to
“
mitigate
impacts
and
make
it
look
like
the
issue
wasn
’
t
as
bad
as
it
was
”
so
it
could
take
“
the
minimum
required
corrective
actions.
”
Another
former
quality
engineer
,
who
spoke
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
for
fear
of
repercussions
from
Emergent
,
said
his
superiors
told
him
it
was
“
better
to
disclose
less
detail
than
more
”
in
written
reports
about
problems
so
as
not
to
raise
suspicions
among
F.D.A
.
inspectors.Mr
.
Hartwig
said
he
could
not
comment
on
the
allegations
because
they
were
being
raised
by
former
employees
who
had
not
reported
them
at
the
time
or
were
now
“
re-evaluating
earlier
situations
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight.
”
Quality
control
failures
have
had
momentous
consequences
at
Emergent
’
s
Bayview
plant
.
Behind
the
scenes
,
concerns
mounted
last
year
as
a
series
of
confidential
audits
identified
serious
shortcomings
,
The
Times
previously
reported
.
Problems
broke
into
public
view
in
March
after
workers
accidentally
contaminated
a
batch
of
Johnson
&
Johnson
’
s
vaccine
with
a
key
ingredient
in
AstraZeneca
’
s
,
prompting
a
federal
crackdown.Officials
ordered
the
plant
to
pause
production
while
they
inspected
it
,
stripped
Emergent
of
its
responsibility
to
produce
the
AstraZeneca
vaccine
and
instructed
Johnson
&
Johnson
to
assert
direct
control
over
the
manufacturing
of
its
vaccine
at
the
site.On
Friday
,
the
F.D.A
.
decided
that
the
equivalent
of
60
million
doses
of
Johnson
&
Johnson
’
s
vaccine
produced
by
Emergent
could
not
be
used
because
of
possible
contamination
.
That
brought
the
number
of
Johnson
&
Johnson
doses
ruined
by
Emergent
’
s
poor
manufacturing
practices
to
75
million.Separately
,
the
agency
has
allowed
about
25
million
Johnson
&
Johnson
doses
to
be
distributed
—
including
15
million
cleared
on
Tuesday
—
but
with
a
warning
that
regulators
could
not
guarantee
that
Emergent
had
adhered
to
manufacturing
standards
.
The
equivalent
of
more
than
100
million
additional
doses
of
Johnson
&
Johnson
and
AstraZeneca
produced
at
the
plant
are
being
held
as
regulators
review
records
and
tests
to
determine
if
they
are
safe.A
full-blown
inspection
to
ensure
the
factory
has
corrected
a
pattern
of
lapses
is
still
in
progress
.
A
decision
on
whether
it
can
reopen
is
not
expected
until
later
this
month.Even
with
the
setbacks
,
Emergent
has
projected
another
year
of
record
revenues
,
in
large
part
because
of
its
Covid-19
manufacturing
contracts
.
The
company
recently
told
investors
that
revenue
from
its
contract
manufacturing
business
would
probably
be
between
$
50
million
and
$
200
million
less
than
previously
projected
,
but
that
the
shortfall
was
likely
to
be
made
up
next
year.Cuba
began
its
Covid-19
mass
vaccination
campaign
more
than
a
month
ago
with
homegrown
,
unproven
vaccines
,
wagering
that
they
would
prove
effective
enough
to
blunt
the
rapid
spread
of
the
coronavirus
on
the
cash-strapped
Caribbean
island.The
gamble
appears
to
be
paying
off.The
Cuban
health
authorities
said
on
Monday
that
their
country
’
s
three-shot
Abdala
vaccine
had
proved
about
92
percent
effective
against
the
coronavirus
in
late-stage
clinical
trials.Throughout
the
pandemic
,
Cuba
has
declined
to
import
foreign
vaccines
while
striving
to
develop
its
own
,
the
smallest
country
in
the
world
to
do
so.The
announcement
places
Abdala
among
the
most
effective
Covid
vaccines
in
the
world
,
according
to
data
from
clinical
trials
,
on
a
par
with
Pfizer-BioNTech
’
s
95
percent
rate
,
Moderna
’
s
94.1
percent
,
and
Russia
’
s
Sputnik
V
at
91.6
percent.On
Saturday
,
Cuba
’
s
state-run
biotech
corporation
,
BioCubaFarma
,
said
that
another
of
its
vaccines
,
Sovereign
2
,
had
62
percent
efficacy
after
two
of
its
three
required
doses
.
Results
for
the
full
three
doses
are
expected
in
the
next
few
weeks.The
vaccine
news
was
seen
as
a
rare
cause
for
celebration
on
an
island
that
has
been
hammered
both
by
the
pandemic
,
which
has
devastated
its
tourism
industry
,
and
by
Trump-era
economic
sanctions
that
have
not
been
eased
by
the
Biden
administration.Cuba
is
currently
experiencing
its
worst
coronavirus
outbreak
since
the
start
of
the
pandemic
.
It
reported
1,561
new
cases
on
Monday
,
a
record.In
May
the
health
authorities
began
a
mass
vaccination
campaign
in
Havana
before
the
completion
of
Phase
3
trials
,
which
assess
a
vaccine
’
s
effectiveness
and
safety
.
The
emergency
step
was
intended
to
help
combat
the
Beta
variant
,
first
detected
in
South
Africa
,
which
was
spreading
rapidly
in
the
Cuban
capital
.
Close
to
one
million
Cubans
—
about
9
percent
of
the
national
population
—
have
now
received
all
three
doses
of
either
Abdala
or
Sovereign
2
,
according
to
official
figures
.
Officials
say
they
are
seeing
a
slowing
of
the
virus
’
s
spread
in
Havana
,
where
vaccinations
have
been
concentrated
so
far.Countries
including
Mexico
,
Argentina
,
Vietnam
and
Iran
have
expressed
interest
in
Cuba
’
s
coronavirus
vaccines
.
The
high
announced
rate
of
efficacy
could
reinforce
hopes
that
biotechnology
exports
will
help
lift
Cuba
from
the
depths
of
its
economic
crisis.The
vaccines
made
by
Pfizer-BioNTech
and
Moderna
set
off
a
persistent
immune
reaction
in
the
body
that
may
protect
against
the
coronavirus
for
years
,
scientists
reported
on
Monday.The
findings
add
to
growing
evidence
that
most
people
immunized
with
the
mRNA
vaccines
may
not
need
boosters
,
so
long
as
the
virus
and
its
variants
do
not
evolve
much
beyond
their
current
forms
—
which
is
not
guaranteed
.
People
who
recovered
from
Covid-19
before
being
vaccinated
may
not
need
boosters
even
if
the
virus
does
make
a
significant
transformation.
“
It
’
s
a
good
sign
for
how
durable
our
immunity
is
from
this
vaccine
,
”
said
Ali
Ellebedy
,
an
immunologist
at
Washington
University
in
St.
Louis
who
led
the
study
,
which
was
published
in
the
journal
Nature.The
study
did
not
consider
the
coronavirus
vaccine
made
by
Johnson
&
Johnson
,
but
Dr.
Ellebedy
said
he
expected
the
immune
response
to
be
less
durable
than
that
produced
by
mRNA
vaccines.Dr
.
Ellebedy
and
his
colleagues
reported
last
month
that
in
people
who
survived
Covid-19
,
immune
cells
that
recognize
the
virus
lie
quiescent
in
the
bone
marrow
for
at
least
eight
months
after
infection
.
A
study
by
another
team
indicated
that
so-called
memory
B
cells
continue
to
mature
and
strengthen
for
at
least
a
year
after
infection.Based
on
those
findings
,
researchers
suggested
that
immunity
might
last
for
years
,
possibly
a
lifetime
,
in
people
who
were
infected
with
the
coronavirus
and
later
vaccinated
.
But
it
was
unclear
whether
vaccination
alone
might
have
a
similarly
long-lasting
effect.Dr
.
Ellebedy
’
s
team
sought
to
address
that
question
by
looking
at
the
source
of
memory
cells
:
the
lymph
nodes
,
where
immune
cells
train
to
recognize
and
fight
the
virus.After
an
infection
or
a
vaccination
,
a
specialized
structure
called
the
germinal
center
forms
in
lymph
nodes
.
This
structure
is
an
elite
school
of
sorts
for
B
cells
—
a
boot
camp
where
they
become
increasingly
sophisticated
and
learn
to
recognize
a
diverse
set
of
viral
genetic
sequences.The
broader
the
range
and
the
longer
these
cells
have
to
practice
,
the
more
likely
they
are
to
be
able
to
thwart
variants
of
the
virus
that
may
emerge.
“
Everyone
always
focuses
on
the
virus
evolving
—
this
is
showing
that
the
B
cells
are
doing
the
same
thing
,
”
said
Marion
Pepper
,
an
immunologist
at
the
University
of
Washington
in
Seattle
.
“
And
it
’
s
going
to
be
protective
against
ongoing
evolution
of
the
virus
,
which
is
really
encouraging.
”
After
infection
with
the
coronavirus
,
the
germinal
center
forms
in
the
lungs
.
But
after
vaccination
,
the
cells
’
education
takes
place
in
lymph
nodes
in
the
armpits
,
within
reach
of
researchers.Dr
.
Ellebedy
and
his
colleagues
recruited
41
people
—
including
eight
with
a
history
of
infection
with
the
virus
—
who
were
immunized
with
two
doses
of
the
Pfizer-BioNTech
vaccine
.
From
14
of
these
people
,
the
team
extracted
samples
from
the
lymph
nodes
at
three
,
four
,
five
,
seven
and
15
weeks
after
the
first
dose.That
painstaking
work
makes
this
a
“
heroic
study
,
”
said
Akiko
Iwasaki
,
an
immunologist
at
Yale
.
“
This
kind
of
careful
time-course
analysis
in
humans
is
very
difficult
to
do.
”
Dr
.
Ellebedy
’
s
team
found
that
15
weeks
after
the
first
dose
of
vaccine
,
the
germinal
center
was
still
highly
active
in
all
14
of
the
participants
,
and
that
the
number
of
memory
cells
that
recognized
the
coronavirus
had
not
declined.
“
The
fact
that
the
reactions
continued
for
almost
four
months
after
vaccination
—
that
’
s
a
very
,
very
good
sign
,
”
Dr.
Ellebedy
said
.
Germinal
centers
typically
peak
one
to
two
weeks
after
immunization
,
and
then
wane.
“
Usually
by
four
to
six
weeks
,
there
’
s
not
much
left
,
”
said
Deepta
Bhattacharya
,
an
immunologist
at
the
University
of
Arizona
.
But
germinal
centers
stimulated
by
the
mRNA
vaccines
are
“
still
going
,
months
into
it
,
and
not
a
lot
of
decline
in
most
people.
”
Dr
.
Bhattacharya
noted
that
most
of
what
scientists
know
about
the
persistence
of
germinal
centers
is
based
on
animal
research
.
The
new
study
is
the
first
to
show
what
happens
in
people
after
vaccination.The
results
suggest
that
a
vast
majority
of
vaccinated
people
will
be
protected
over
the
long
term
—
at
least
,
against
the
existing
coronavirus
variants
.
But
older
adults
,
people
with
weak
immune
systems
and
those
who
take
drugs
that
suppress
immunity
may
need
boosters
;
people
who
survived
Covid-19
and
were
later
immunized
may
never
need
them
at
all.Exactly
how
long
the
protection
from
mRNA
vaccines
will
last
is
hard
to
predict
.
In
the
absence
of
variants
that
sidestep
immunity
,
in
theory
immunity
could
last
a
lifetime
,
experts
said
.
But
the
virus
is
clearly
evolving.
“
Anything
that
would
actually
require
a
booster
would
be
variant-based
,
not
based
on
waning
of
immunity
,
”
Dr.
Bhattacharya
said
.
“
I
just
don
’
t
see
that
happening.
”
People
who
were
infected
with
the
coronavirus
and
then
immunized
see
a
major
boost
in
their
antibody
levels
,
most
likely
because
their
memory
B
cells
—
which
produce
antibodies
—
had
many
months
to
evolve
before
vaccination.The
good
news
:
A
booster
vaccine
will
probably
have
the
same
effect
as
prior
infection
in
immunized
people
,
Dr.
Ellebedy
said
.
“
If
you
give
them
another
chance
to
engage
,
they
will
have
a
massive
response
,
”
he
said
,
referring
to
memory
B
cells.In
terms
of
bolstering
the
immune
system
,
vaccination
is
“
probably
better
”
than
recovering
from
the
actual
infection
,
he
said
.
Other
studies
have
suggested
that
the
repertoire
of
memory
B
cells
produced
after
vaccination
is
more
diverse
than
that
generated
by
infection
,
suggesting
that
the
vaccines
will
protect
better
against
variants
than
natural
immunity
alone.Dr
.
Ellebedy
said
the
results
also
suggested
that
these
signs
of
persistent
immune
reaction
might
be
caused
by
mRNA
vaccines
alone
,
as
opposed
to
those
made
by
more
traditional
means
,
like
Johnson
&
Johnson
’
s.But
that
is
an
unfair
comparison
,
because
the
Johnson
&
Johnson
vaccine
is
given
as
a
single
dose
,
Dr.
Iwasaki
said
:
“
If
the
J
&
J
had
a
booster
,
maybe
it
will
induce
this
same
kind
of
response.
”
With
all
American
adults
now
eligible
for
Covid-19
vaccines
and
businesses
and
international
borders
reopening
,
a
fierce
debate
has
kicked
off
across
the
United
States
over
whether
a
digital
health
certificate
(
often
and
somewhat
misleadingly
called
a
“
vaccine
passport
”
)
should
be
required
to
prove
immunization
status.Currently
,
Americans
are
issued
a
white
paper
card
as
evidence
of
their
Covid-19
shots
,
but
these
can
easily
be
forged
,
and
online
scammers
are
already
selling
false
and
stolen
vaccine
cards.While
the
federal
government
has
said
it
will
not
introduce
digital
vaccine
passports
by
federal
mandate
,
a
growing
number
of
businesses
—
from
cruise
lines
to
sports
venues
—
say
they
will
require
proof
of
vaccinations
for
entry
or
services
.
Hundreds
of
digital
health
pass
initiatives
are
scrambling
to
launch
apps
that
provide
a
verified
electronic
record
of
immunizations
and
negative
coronavirus
test
results
to
streamline
the
process.The
drive
has
raised
privacy
and
equity
concerns
and
some
states
like
Florida
and
Texas
have
banned
businesses
from
requiring
vaccination
certificates
.
But
developers
argue
that
the
digital
infrastructure
is
secure
and
will
help
speed
up
the
process
of
reopening
society
and
reviving
travel.Governments
,
technology
companies
,
airlines
and
other
businesses
are
testing
different
versions
of
the
digital
health
passes
and
are
trying
to
come
up
with
common
standards
so
that
there
is
compatibility
between
each
system
and
health
records
can
be
pulled
in
a
safe
and
controlled
format.The
process
comes
with
great
technical
challenges
,
especially
because
of
the
sheer
number
of
app
initiatives
underway
.
For
the
certificates
to
be
useful
,
countries
,
airlines
and
businesses
must
agree
on
common
standards
and
the
infrastructure
they
use
will
need
to
be
compatible
.
In
the
United
States
,
there
is
an
added
complexity
of
getting
individual
states
to
share
immunization
data
with
different
certificate
platforms
while
maintaining
the
privacy
of
residents.Here
’
s
what
we
know
about
the
current
status
of
digital
health
passes
and
some
of
the
roadblocks
they
are
facing
in
the
United
States.In
March
,
New
York
became
the
first
state
in
the
United
States
to
launch
a
digital
health
certificate
called
Excelsior
Pass
,
which
verifies
a
person
’
s
negative
coronavirus
test
result
and
if
they
are
fully
vaccinated.The
app
and
website
,
which
has
now
had
more
than
one
million
downloads
,
is
free
and
voluntary
for
all
New
York
residents
,
and
provides
a
QR
code
that
can
be
scanned
or
printed
out
to
verify
a
person
’
s
health
data
.
The
pass
has
been
used
by
thousands
of
New
Yorkers
to
enter
Yankee
Stadium
,
Madison
Square
Garden
and
other
smaller
public
venues.Most
businesses
require
people
to
show
their
state
I.D
.
along
with
their
Excelsior
Pass
to
prevent
potential
fraud.In
Israel
,
where
more
than
half
the
population
is
fully
vaccinated
,
residents
must
show
an
electronic
“
Green
Pass
”
to
attend
places
such
as
gyms
,
concerts
,
wedding
halls
and
to
dine
indoors
.
The
European
Union
has
endorsed
an
electronic
vaccine
certificate
to
be
recognized
from
July
1
,
which
a
number
of
European
countries
have
begun
using
,
but
each
individual
member
country
will
be
able
to
set
its
own
rules
for
travel
requirements
.
Britain
has
also
started
testing
a
Covid-19
certificate
system
that
aims
to
help
businesses
reopen
safely.Some
airlines
including
Lufthansa
,
Virgin
Atlantic
and
Jet
Blue
have
started
to
use
the
digital
health
app
,
Common
Pass
,
to
verify
passenger
Covid-19
test
results
before
they
board
flights
.
The
International
Air
Transport
Association
’
s
Health
Pass
is
being
used
by
more
than
20
airlines
and
allows
passengers
to
upload
health
credentials
necessary
for
international
travel.It
depends
on
state
regulations
.
The
Biden
administration
has
said
there
will
be
no
federal
vaccination
system
or
mandate
.
Individual
states
hold
primary
public
health
powers
in
the
United
States
and
have
the
authority
to
require
vaccines.
“
We
expect
a
vaccine
passport
,
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
,
will
be
driven
by
the
private
sector
,
”
Jen
Psaki
,
the
White
House
press
secretary
,
said
at
a
briefing
in
March
.
“
There
will
be
no
centralized
,
universal
federal
vaccinations
database
and
no
federal
mandate
requiring
everyone
to
obtain
a
single
vaccination
credential.
”
In
April
,
Gov
.
Greg
Abbott
of
Texas
issued
an
executive
order
banning
government
agencies
,
private
businesses
and
institutions
that
receive
state
funding
from
requiring
people
to
show
proof
that
they
have
been
vaccinated
against
the
coronavirus.Ron
DeSantis
,
the
Florida
governor
,
issued
a
similar
order
,
saying
that
requiring
proof
of
vaccination
would
“
reduce
individual
freedom
”
and
“
harm
patient
privacy
”
as
well
as
“
create
two
classes
of
citizens
based
on
vaccinations.
”
But
those
orders
may
not
stick
.
“
The
governors
are
on
shaky
legal
ground
,
”
said
Lawrence
Gostin
,
the
director
of
the
O
’
Neill
Institute
for
National
and
Global
Health
Law
at
Georgetown
University
.
“
Certainly
,
the
legislature
has
authority
to
regulate
businesses
in
the
state
,
and
it
can
also
pre-empt
counties
and
local
governments
from
issuing
vaccine
passports
.
But
a
governor
,
acting
on
his
or
her
own
,
has
no
inherent
power
to
regulate
businesses
other
than
through
emergency
or
other
health
powers
that
the
legislature
gives
them.
”
In
the
United
States
,
there
is
no
centralized
federal
vaccine
database
.
Instead
,
the
states
collect
that
information
.
All
states
except
New
Hampshire
have
their
own
immunization
registries
and
some
cities
,
like
New
York
,
have
their
own.Currently
states
are
required
to
share
their
registries
with
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
,
but
the
data
is
not
public
and
could
be
withheld.That
means
anyone
developing
a
digital
vaccine
certificate
in
the
United
States
would
have
to
obtain
immunization
data
from
individual
states
,
which
could
be
problematic
in
states
that
oppose
health
pass
initiatives.One
of
the
issues
is
with
terminology
.
A
passport
is
issued
by
a
government
and
certifies
personal
data
including
a
person
’
s
legal
name
and
date
of
birth
.
Many
people
fear
that
if
they
are
required
to
have
one
related
to
the
coronavirus
,
they
will
be
handing
over
personal
and
sensitive
health
data
to
private
companies
that
could
be
stolen
or
used
for
other
purposes.
“
There
are
a
whole
lot
of
valid
concerns
about
how
privacy
and
technology
would
work
with
these
systems
,
especially
as
Silicon
Valley
does
not
have
a
great
history
delivering
technologies
that
are
privacy
enhancing
,
”
said
Brian
Behlendorf
,
executive
director
of
Linux
Foundation
Public
Health
,
an
open-source
,
technology-focused
organization.
“
And
the
concept
of
privacy
here
is
complicated
because
you
are
ultimately
trying
to
prove
to
somebody
that
you
received
something
,
”
he
said
.
“
You
aren
’
t
keeping
a
secret
,
so
the
challenge
is
to
present
and
prove
something
without
creating
a
chain
of
traceability
forever
that
might
be
used.
”
The
Linux
Foundation
is
working
with
a
network
of
technology
companies
called
the
Covid-19
Credentials
Initiative
to
develop
a
set
of
standards
for
preserving
privacy
in
the
use
of
vaccine
certificates
.
The
main
aim
of
the
initiative
is
to
establish
a
verifiable
credential
(
much
like
a
card
in
one
’
s
wallet
)
that
contains
a
set
of
claims
about
an
individual
but
is
digitally
native
and
cryptographically
secure.Some
argue
that
such
a
credential
would
intrude
on
personal
freedoms
and
private
health
choices.
“
‘
Vaccine
passports
’
must
be
stopped
,
”
former
Representative
Ron
Paul
of
Texas
wrote
in
a
tweet
last
week
.
“
Accepting
them
means
accepting
the
false
idea
that
government
owns
your
life
,
body
and
freedom.
”
Others
worry
that
an
exclusively
digital
system
would
leave
some
communities
behind
,
especially
those
who
do
not
have
access
to
smartphones
or
the
internet.
“
Any
solutions
in
this
area
should
be
simple
,
free
,
open
source
,
accessible
to
people
both
digitally
and
on
paper
,
and
designed
from
the
start
to
protect
people
’
s
privacy
,
”
Jeff
Zients
,
the
White
House
coronavirus
coordinator
,
said
in
a
statement.The
World
Health
Organization
said
in
April
that
it
does
not
back
requiring
vaccination
passports
for
travel
yet
because
of
the
uncertainty
over
whether
inoculation
prevents
transmission
of
the
virus
,
as
well
as
equity
concerns
.
But
the
organization
is
working
with
a
number
of
agencies
,
like
UNICEF
,
ITU
and
the
European
Commission
,
to
establish
the
standards
and
specifications
of
a
possible
globally
recognized
,
digital
vaccination
certificate.Follow

Covid-free

“

”
The
tiny
island
nation
of
the
Seychelles
aimed
to
jump-start
its
economy.All
three
put
their
faith
,
at
least
in
part
,
in
easily
accessible
Chinese-made
vaccines
,
which
would
allow
them
to
roll
out
ambitious
inoculation
programs
when
much
of
the
world
was
going
without.But
instead
of
freedom
from
the
coronavirus
,
all
three
countries
are
now
battling
a
surge
in
infections.China
kicked
off
its
vaccine
diplomacy
campaign
last
year
by
pledging
to
provide
a
shot
that
would
be
safe
and
effective
at
preventing
severe
cases
of
Covid-19
.
Less
certain
at
the
time
was
how
successful
it
and
other
vaccines
would
be
at
curbing
transmission.Now
,
examples
from
several
countries
suggest
that
the
Chinese
vaccines
may
not
be
very
effective
at
preventing
the
spread
of
the
virus
,
particularly
the
new
variants
.
The
experiences
of
those
countries
lay
bare
a
harsh
reality
facing
a
postpandemic
world
:
The
degree
of
recovery
may
depend
on
which
vaccines
governments
give
to
their
people.In
the
Seychelles
,
Chile
,
Bahrain
and
Mongolia
,
50
to
68
percent
of
the
populations
have
been
fully
inoculated
,
outpacing
the
United
States
,
according
to
Our
World
in
Data
,
a
data
tracking
project
.
All
four
ranked
among
the
top
10
countries
with
the
worst
Covid
outbreaks
as
recently
as
last
week
,
according
to
data
from
The
New
York
Times
.
And
all
four
are
mostly
using
shots
made
by
two
Chinese
vaccine
makers
,
Sinopharm
and
Sinovac
Biotech.
“
If
the
vaccines
are
sufficiently
good
,
we
should
not
see
this
pattern
,
”
said
Jin
Dongyan
,
a
virologist
at
the
University
of
Hong
Kong
.
“
The
Chinese
have
a
responsibility
to
remedy
this.
”
Scientists
don
’
t
know
for
certain
why
some
countries
with
relatively
high
inoculation
rates
are
suffering
new
outbreaks
.
Variants
,
social
controls
that
are
eased
too
quickly
and
careless
behavior
after
only
the
first
of
a
two-shot
regimen
are
possibilities
.
But
the
breakthrough
infections
could
have
lasting
consequences.In
the
United
States
,
about
45
percent
of
the
population
is
fully
vaccinated
,
mostly
with
doses
made
by
Pfizer-BioNTech
and
Moderna
.
Cases
have
dropped
94
percent
over
six
months.Israel
provided
shots
from
Pfizer
and
has
the
second-highest
vaccination
rate
in
the
world
,
after
the
Seychelles
.
The
number
of
new
daily
confirmed
Covid-19
cases
per
million
in
Israel
is
now
around
4.95.In
the
Seychelles
,
which
relied
mostly
on
Sinopharm
,
that
number
is
more
than
716
cases
per
million.Disparities
such
as
these
could
create
a
world
in
which
three
types
of
countries
emerge
from
the
pandemic
—
the
wealthy
nations
that
used
their
resources
to
secure
Pfizer-BioNTech
and
Moderna
shots
,
the
poorer
countries
that
are
far
away
from
immunizing
a
majority
of
citizens
,
and
then
those
that
are
fully
inoculated
but
only
partly
protected.China
,
as
well
as
the
more
than
90
nations
that
have
received
the
Chinese
shots
,
may
end
up
in
the
third
group
,
contending
with
rolling
lockdowns
,
testing
and
limits
on
day-to-day
life
for
months
or
years
to
come
.
Economies
could
remain
held
back
.
And
as
more
citizens
question
the
efficacy
of
Chinese
doses
,
persuading
unvaccinated
people
to
line
up
for
shots
may
also
become
more
difficult.One
month
after
receiving
his
second
dose
of
Sinopharm
,
Otgonjargal
Baatar
fell
ill
and
tested
positive
for
Covid-19
.
Mr.
Otgonjargal
,
a
31-year-old
miner
,
spent
nine
days
in
a
hospital
in
Ulaanbaatar
,
the
capital
of
Mongolia
.
He
said
he
was
now
questioning
the
usefulness
of
the
shot.
“
People
were
convinced
that
if
we
were
vaccinated
,
the
summer
will
be
free
of
Covid
,
”
he
said
.
“
Now
it
turns
out
that
it
’
s
not
true.
”
Beijing
saw
its
vaccine
diplomacy
as
an
opportunity
to
emerge
from
the
pandemic
as
a
more
influential
global
power
.
China
’
s
top
leader
,
Xi
Jinping
,
pledged
to
deliver
a
Chinese
shot
that
could
be
easily
stored
and
transported
to
millions
of
people
around
the
world
.
He
called
it
a
“
global
public
good.
”
Mongolia
was
a
beneficiary
,
jumping
at
the
chance
to
score
millions
of
Sinopharm
shots
.
The
small
country
quickly
rolled
out
an
inoculation
program
and
eased
restrictions
.
It
has
now
vaccinated
52
percent
of
its
population
.
But
on
Sunday
,
it
recorded
2,400
new
infections
,
a
quadrupling
from
a
month
before.In
a
statement
,
China
’
s
Foreign
Ministry
said
it
did
not
see
a
link
between
the
recent
outbreaks
and
its
vaccines
.
It
cited
the
World
Health
Organization
as
saying
that
vaccination
rates
in
certain
countries
had
not
reached
sufficient
levels
to
prevent
outbreaks
,
and
that
countries
needed
to
continue
to
maintain
controls.
“
Relevant
reports
and
data
also
show
that
many
countries
that
use
Chinese-made
vaccines
have
expressed
that
they
are
safe
and
reliable
,
and
have
played
a
good
role
in
their
epidemic
prevention
efforts
,
”
the
ministry
said
.
China
has
also
emphasized
that
its
vaccines
target
severe
disease
rather
than
transmission.No
vaccine
fully
prevents
transmission
,
and
people
can
still
fall
ill
after
being
inoculated
,
but
the
relatively
low
efficacy
rates
of
Chinese
shots
have
been
identified
as
a
possible
cause
of
the
recent
outbreaks.The
Pfizer-BioNTech
and
Moderna
vaccines
have
efficacy
rates
of
more
than
90
percent
.
A
variety
of
other
vaccines
—
including
AstraZeneca
and
Johnson
&
Johnson
—
have
efficacy
rates
of
around
70
percent
.
The
Sinopharm
vaccine
developed
with
the
Beijing
Institute
of
Biological
Products
has
an
efficacy
rate
of
78.1
percent
;
the
Sinovac
vaccine
has
an
efficacy
rate
of
51
percent.The
Chinese
companies
have
not
released
much
clinical
data
to
show
how
their
vaccines
work
at
preventing
transmission
.
On
Monday
,
Shao
Yiming
,
an
epidemiologist
with
the
Chinese
Center
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
,
said
China
needed
to
fully
vaccinate
80
to
85
percent
of
its
population
to
achieve
herd
immunity
,
revising
a
previous
official
estimate
of
70
percent.Data
on
breakthrough
infections
has
not
been
made
available
,
either
,
though
a
Sinovac
study
out
of
Chile
showed
that
the
vaccine
was
less
effective
than
those
from
Pfizer-BioNTech
and
Moderna
at
preventing
infection
among
vaccinated
individuals.A
representative
from
Sinopharm
hung
up
the
phone
when
reached
for
comment
.
Sinovac
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment.William
Schaffner
,
medical
director
of
the
National
Foundation
for
Infectious
Diseases
at
Vanderbilt
University
,
said
the
efficacy
rates
of
Chinese
shots
could
be
low
enough
“
to
sustain
some
transmission
,
as
well
as
create
illness
of
a
substantial
amount
in
the
highly
vaccinated
population
,
even
though
it
keeps
people
largely
out
of
the
hospital.
”
Despite
the
spike
in
cases
,
officials
in
both
the
Seychelles
and
Mongolia
have
defended
Sinopharm
,
saying
it
is
effective
in
preventing
severe
cases
of
the
disease.Batbayar
Ochirbat
,
head
researcher
of
the
Scientific
Advisory
Group
for
Emergencies
at
Mongolia
’
s
Ministry
of
Health
,
said
Mongolia
had
made
the
right
decision
to
go
with
the
Chinese-made
shot
,
in
part
because
it
had
helped
keep
the
mortality
rate
low
in
the
country
.
Data
from
Mongolia
showed
that
the
Sinopharm
vaccine
was
actually
more
protective
than
the
doses
developed
by
AstraZeneca
and
Sputnik
,
a
Russian
vaccine
,
according
to
the
Health
Ministry.The
reason
for
the
surge
in
Mongolia
,
Mr.
Batbayar
said
,
is
that
the
country
reopened
too
quickly
,
and
many
people
believed
they
were
protected
after
only
one
dose.
“
I
think
you
could
say
Mongolians
celebrated
too
early
,
”
he
said
.
“
My
advice
is
the
celebrations
should
start
after
the
full
vaccinations
,
so
this
is
the
lesson
learned
.
There
was
too
much
confidence.
”
Some
health
officials
and
scientists
are
less
confident.Nikolai

in
Australia
,
said
that
with
all
of
the
evidence
,
it
would
be
reasonable
to
assume
the
Sinopharm
vaccine
had
minimal
effect
on
curbing
transmission
.
A
major
risk
with
the
Chinese
inoculation
is
that
vaccinated
people
may
have
few
or
no
symptoms
and
still
spread
the
virus
to
others
,
he
said.
“
I
think
that
this
complexity
has
been
lost
on
most
decision
makers
around
the
world.
”
In
Indonesia
,
where
a
new
variant
is
spreading
,
more
than
350
doctors
and
health
care
workers
recently
came
down
with
Covid-19
despite
being
fully
vaccinated
with
Sinovac
,
according
to
the
risk
mitigation
team
of
the
Indonesian
Medical
Association
.
Across
the
country
,
61
doctors
died
between
February
and
June
7
.
Ten
of
them
had
taken
the
Chinese-made
vaccine
,
the
association
said.The
numbers
were
enough
to
make
Kenneth
Mak
,
Singapore
’
s
director
of
medical
services
,
question
the
use
of
Sinovac
.
“
It
’
s
not
a
problem
associated
with
Pfizer
,
”
Mr.
Mak
said
at
a
news
conference
on
Friday
.
“
This
is
actually
a
problem
associated
with
the
Sinovac
vaccine.
”
Bahrain
and
the
United
Arab
Emirates
were
the
first
two
countries
to
approve
the
Sinopharm
shot
,
even
before
late-stage
clinical
trial
data
was
released
.
Since
then
,
there
have
been
extensive
reports
of
vaccinated
people
falling
ill
in
both
countries
.
In
a
statement
,
the
Bahraini
government
’
s
media
office
said
the
kingdom
’
s
vaccine
rollout
had
been
“
efficient
and
successful
to
date.
”
Still
,
last
month
officials
from
Bahrain
and
the
United
Arab
Emirates
announced
that
they
would
offer
a
third
booster
shot
.
The
choices
:
Pfizer
or
more
Sinopharm.America
is
in
the
midst
of
a
summer
of
celebration
with
cases
and
deaths
from
the
coronavirus
on
the
decline
.
The
collective
relief
is
well
deserved
,
but
parts
of
the
country
remain
vulnerable
to
outbreaks
because
of
spotty
vaccination
rates
between
states
and
even
counties.Any
risk
of
future
surges
and
loss
of
life
is
almost
entirely
preventable
,
given
the
availability
of
vaccines
.
And
yet
there
’
s
reason
to
believe
that
the
plateauing
vaccinations
will
cause
the
nation
to
fall
short
of
President
Biden
’
s
target
of
70
percent
coverage
before
July
4
among
eligible
Americans
.
That
’
s
despite
the
fact
that
an
overwhelming
majority
of
Covid-19
deaths
are
among
the
unvaccinated.So
,
what
happens
now
?
There
’
s
no
reason
the
United
States
should
settle
for
patchwork
vaccination
rates
and
easily
preventable
death
.
There
are
ways
to
overcome
low
vaccine
demand
.
It
starts
with
doctors
and
nurses.Twenty
years
of
research
on
how
to
persuade
people
to
get
vaccinated
shows
that
health
care
providers
are
the
most
trusted
source
of
vaccine
information
,
even
among
vaccine
refusers
.
The
nation
’
s
doctors
and
nurses
need
to
talk
to
patients
about
Covid-19
vaccines
at
every
opportunity.This
may
seem
obvious
,
and
yet
very
few
providers
have
been
trained
in
the
most
effective
approaches
for
talking
to
people
about
vaccines.For
example
,
doctors
and
nurses
may
assume
they
need
to
offer
patients
more
information
about
the
vaccines
in
order
to
persuade
them
.
But
research
shows
that
often
a
lack
of
knowledge
is
not
the
main
problem
.
Many
people
refuse
vaccines
because
of
their
worldview
,
values
or
mistrust
of
the
health
system
.
While
people
on
the
fence
about
vaccination
may
have
needed
more
information
to
help
make
up
their
mind
early
on
,
at
this
stage
,
there
’
s
information
overload.Strategies
like
framing
vaccination
as
the
default
choice
—
“
It
’
s
time
for
you
to
get
vaccinated
,
”
versus
,
“
Maybe
you
should
think
about
receiving
the
Covid
vaccine
”
—
can
be
effective
.
It
doesn
’
t
take
away
someone
’
s
autonomy
,
but
still
serves
as
a
verbal
nudge
toward
vaccination.But
how
can
the
nation
ensure
that
its
doctors
use
these
approaches
?
There
needs
to
be
a
continuing
medical
education
program
—
a
tool
used
by
physicians
to
keep
their
skills
and
knowledge
of
medicine
up-to-date
and
to
maintain
their
license
—
to
train
them
in
effective
vaccine
communication
techniques
.
We
recently
started
such
a
program
at
Yale.Another
way
to
ensure
that
health
care
providers
spend
sufficient
time
on
sometimes
challenging
conversations
about
vaccines
is
to
make
vaccine
counseling
reimbursable
.
Right
now
,
providers
are
compensated
if
they
vaccinate
their
patient
;
they
don
’
t
get
reimbursed
if
the
patient
ends
up
refusing
the
vaccine.But
doctors
don
’
t
always
know
if
their
conversations
with
patients
persuaded
them
to
be
vaccinated
or
not
.
They
should
be
compensated
for
having
the
conversation
in
the
first
place
.
Many
other
countries
do
so
.
For
example
,
Australia
recently
instituted
rebates
for
general
practitioners
who
provide
counseling
on
Covid-19
vaccines.Persuading
people
to
get
vaccinated
often
requires
multiple
discussions
.
Ideally
,
as
part
of
any
appointment
,
physicians
will
urge
unvaccinated
patients
to
get
the
Covid-19
vaccine
,
and
talk
through
any
concerns
.
If
the
physician
does
so
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
(
e.g.
,
more
than
three
minutes
,
similar
to
the
threshold
for
reimbursing
physicians
for
smoking
cessation
counseling
)
,
the
doctor
can
seek
reimbursement
.
Physicians
should
be
able
to
bill
for
multiple
counseling
sessions
with
the
same
patient
up
to
a
reasonable
limit
of
three
times
per
year.Other
continuing
efforts
,
such
as
increasing
vaccine
access
and
making
the
vaccination
process
simple
,
remain
important
.
To
this
day
,
there
are
many
people
who
are
concerned
about
the
cost
of
the
vaccines
even
though
they
are
free
.
Vaccination
sites
should
stop
asking
for
insurance
information.The
most
effective
vaccine
message
is
one
that
comes
from
a
trusted
source
and
not
only
leads
the
listeners
to
get
vaccinated
but
also
motivates
them
to
encourage
others
around
them
to
do
so
as
well
.
This
is
what
we
need
,
as
people
become
complacent
with
the
benefits
of
others
getting
vaccinated
.
Health
care
providers
hold
this
sway
,
and
all
health
workers
need
to
push
toward
higher
vaccination
rates
together.Morgan
Stanley
will
require
employees
and
visitors
to
be
vaccinated
against
the
coronavirus
when
they
enter
its
New
York
offices
next
month.Starting
July
12
,
employees
,
contingent
workers
,
clients
and
visitors
at
Morgan
Stanley
’
s
buildings
in
New
York
City
and
Westchester
County
must
attest
that
they
are
fully
vaccinated
,
a
person
familiar
with
the
matter
said
,
citing
a
memo
from
Mandell
Crawley
,
the
bank
’
s
chief
human
resources
officer
.
Staff
members
who
don
’
t
will
be
required
to
work
remotely
,
added
the
person
,
who
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
to
discuss
personnel-related
matters.Although
the
requirement
relies
on
an
honor
system
for
now
rather
than
proof
of
vaccination
,
it
will
allow
the
bank
to
lift
other
pandemic
protocols
,
such
as
face
coverings
and
physical
distancing
.
Some
office
spaces
for
Morgan
Stanley
’
s
institutional
securities
,
investment
and
wealth
management
divisions
already
allow
only
those
who
have
received
their
shots
to
work
from
their
desks.Companies
across
America
are
grappling
with
the
question
of
whether
to
ask
employees
about
their
vaccination
status
,
or
to
require
those
returning
to
offices
to
be
vaccinated
.
The
Equal
Employment
Opportunity
Commission
said
last
month
that
both
actions
were
legal
.
Still
,
some
senior
executives
have
worried
about
pushback
from
employees.This
month
,
Goldman
Sachs
said
its
employees
in
the
United
States
would
have
to
report
their
vaccination
status
.
Other
big
Wall
Street
banks
,
including
JPMorgan
Chase
and
Bank
of
America
,
are
encouraging
workers
to
disclose
their
vaccination
status
voluntarily
.
BlackRock
,
the
asset
manager
,
will
allow
only
vaccinated
staff
to
return
to
the
office
beginning
next
month
,
Bloomberg
reported
.
Those
firms
,
however
,
stopped
short
of
also
asking
clients
and
visitors
to
attest
to
being
vaccinated.The
Financial
Times
reported
earlier
on
Morgan
Stanley
’
s
vaccine
requirements.When
the
coronavirus
hit
,
the
Serum
Institute
of
India
seemed
uniquely
positioned
to
help
.
It
is
world
’
s
largest
vaccine
maker
,
producing
1.5
billion
doses
a
year
for
diseases
from
polio
to
tetanus
.
Striking
a
deal
with
AstraZeneca
,
its
leaders
promised
to
make
and
deliver
a
billion
doses
of
vaccine
to
low-
and
middle-income
nations
.
Earlier
this
year
,
however
,
a
second
wave
of
the
coronavirus
hit
India
hard
and
Prime
Minister
Narendra
Modi
decided
to
ban
all
exports
of
vaccines
.
What
has
this
ban
meant
for
the
nations
that
were
promised
millions
of
doses
,
and
for
the
Serum
Institute
itself
?
NEW
DELHI
—
At
9:45
p.m.
,
alarms
blared
across
the
intensive
care
unit
of
Jaipur
Golden
Hospital
.
Over
two
dozen
patients
on
ventilators
couldn
’
t
breathe
.
Some
flailed
their
arms
and
legs
.
Others
cried
for
help
,
choking
sounds
coming
from
their
throats
as
if
they
were
being
strangled.Mechanics
sprinted
to
the
maintenance
room
to
see
what
was
wrong
.
Nurses
grabbed
small
plastic
pumps
to
fill
the
lungs
of
critically
ill
patients
by
hand.It
wasn
’
t
enough
.
Jaipur
Golden
,
a
respected
hospital
in
Delhi
,
had
run
out
of
medical
oxygen
.
Over
the
next
seven
hours
,
21
coronavirus
patients
died.
“
Nobody
can
forget
that
night
,
”
said
Shaista
Nigar
,
the
hospital
’
s
nursing
superintendent
.
“
It
was
a
total
breakdown.
”
Across
India
,
amid
a
devastating
second
wave
of
Covid-19
,
hospitals
ran
out
of
beds
and
critical
supplies
,
contributing
to
the
deaths
of
untold
thousands
of
people
and
worsening
an
already
tragic
outbreak
.
By
one
count
,
oxygen
shortages
alone
have
killed
at
least
600
people
over
the
past
two
months.India
’
s
leaders
knew
the
country
was
vulnerable
.
Yet
Prime
Minister
Narendra
Modi
’
s
government
and
local
officials
alike
failed
to
prepare
for
the
second
wave
,
according
to
interviews
and
a
review
of
government
documents
by
The
New
York
Times.India
is
a
major
producer
of
compressed
oxygen
.
But
the
Indian
government
moved
too
late
to
distribute
supplies.State
governments
feuded
over
oxygen
and
seized
tankers
,
creating
bottlenecks
and
delays.Delhi
city
officials
didn
’
t
build
systems
to
produce
or
store
oxygen
and
struggled
to
allocate
dwindling
supplies
.
When
tight
supplies
and
government
missteps
led
oxygen
to
run
out
at
Jaipur
Golden
,
some
families
said
the
hospital
offered
no
warning.Without
a
comprehensive
coronavirus
plan
,
Mr.
Modi
’
s
government
has
left
much
of
the
burden
to
states
,
cities
,
hospitals
and
even
individuals
.
The
oxygen
crisis
tragically
revealed
the
limits
of
a
do-it-yourself
approach.That
approach
will
be
tested
again
.
Though
infections
have
dropped
,
a
vaccine
shortage
puts
India
at
risk
of
a
third
wave
.
Without
adequate
preparations
,
the
second
wave
’
s
tragedies
could
return.
“
With
an
effective
surge
plan
,
”
said
Robert
Matiru
,
a
director
at
Unitaid
,
a
health
initiative
affiliated
with
the
World
Health
Organization
,
“
this
could
have
been
averted.
”
Anuradha
Bansal
had
a
102-degree
fever
when
she
checked
into
Jaipur
Golden
on
April
13
.
A
veteran
schoolteacher
,
Ms.
Bansal
had
tested
positive
for
Covid-19
,
along
with
her
husband
,
Atul
,
and
their
two
daughters.Jaipur
Golden
had
a
good
reputation
.
A
four-story
private
hospital
,
it
offered
specialties
like
orthopedics
and
pediatric
gastroenterology
.
Its
motto
was
“
We
Care
…
With
Care.
”
But
Ms.
Bansal
was
shocked
by
the
crowds
filling
Jaipur
Golden
and
other
hospitals
in
Delhi
.
Sick
people
packed
the
reception
area
,
some
leaning
against
the
walls
.
In
her
Covid-19
ward
,
she
said
,
extra
beds
had
been
squeezed
in.Her
husband
,
Atul
,
a
lawyer
,
was
lying
on
his
back
in
the
I.C.U
.
down
the
hall
,
a
plastic
oxygen
mask
strapped
to
his
face
.
He
had
been
healthy
for
his
54
years
,
a
strong
swimmer
who
could
hold
his
breath
for
minutes
and
ate
a
wholesome
diet
of
beans
,
whole
grain
flour
and
yogurt.Across
northern
India
,
medical
oxygen
was
running
short
as
Covid-19
caseloads
soared
.
In
one
month
,
Delhi
’
s
daily
count
had
jumped
to
13,468
from
419
.
Delhi
’
s
650
hospitals
and
nursing
homes
were
so
deluged
that
they
were
shutting
their
gates
,
leaving
people
to
die
at
the
curb
or
in
their
cars.Though
the
tragic
experiences
of
other
places
,
like
Egypt
,
showed
what
happens
when
oxygen
runs
out
,
India
was
still
unprepared
.
It
produces
about
7,100
metric
tons
of
liquid
oxygen
a
day
,
mostly
for
industrial
use
.
At
the
pandemic
’
s
peak
,
India
’
s
demand
soared
to
9,500
metric
tons
a
day.Worse
,
the
oxygen
was
in
the
wrong
place
.
Most
was
produced
near
steel
plants
in
eastern
India
,
hundreds
of
miles
from
hot
spots
like
Delhi.In
November
,
a
parliamentary
committee
urged
leaders
“
to
ensure
that
the
oxygen
inventory
is
in
place.
”
A
plan
was
unveiled
to
eventually
build
more
than
160
plants
that
pull
oxygen
from
the
atmosphere
for
hospital
use
.
Hospitals
expanded
their
oxygen
storage
capacity
by
one-third
,
according
to
government
figures.As
the
second
wave
surged
,
it
was
clear
that
the
efforts
weren
’
t
enough
.
Only
about
one-fifth
of
the
oxygen
plants
had
been
built
.
The
extra
storage
represented
only
a
quarter
of
India
’
s
emergency
needs
.
Oxygen
supplies
were
still
concentrated
in
specific
regions.On
April
15
,
the
Modi
government
essentially
nationalized
India
’
s
medical
oxygen
and
dictated
each
state
’
s
allotment
.
Air
Force
planes
would
airlift
empty
cryogenic
tanker
trucks
to
places
like
the
Tata
Steel
plant
in
Odisha
State
,
where
they
would
be
filled
with
liquid
oxygen
,
put
on
special
train
cars
and
moved
more
than
1,000
miles
to
Delhi.Still
,
much
of
the
burden
remained
with
the
states
.
In
an
April
17
meeting
,
Dr.
Harsh
Vardhan
,
India
’
s
health
minister
,
urged
11
state
health
chiefs
to
“
plan
in
advance
”
and
increase
medical
infrastructure
,
including
oxygenated
beds
,
“
to
deal
with
any
further
surge
in
cases.
”
Delhi
officials
warned
that
the
central
government
wasn
’
t
giving
them
enough
.
The
Modi
government
allocated
about
350
metric
tons
of
oxygen
a
day
to
the
capital
.
Delhi
needed
twice
that
and
,
in
court
proceedings
,
accused
the
government
of
basing
the
city
’
s
allocation
on
prepandemic
needs
.
The
central
government
cited
desperate
needs
in
other
places.In
the
meantime
,
the
crowds
of
sick
people
at
the
gates
of
Jaipur
Golden
and
other
hospitals
were
growing.By
April
20
,
Jaipur
Golden
was
overstretched
and
undersupplied.
“
My
father
was
seething
from
inside
,
”
said
Rohit
Gupta
,
a
sales
manager
in
Delhi
whose
father
,
Satish
Kumar
Gupta
,
had
been
admitted
to
the
I.C.U
.
in
early
April
.
The
younger
Mr.
Gupta
said
his
father
soiled
the
bed
because
nobody
helped
him
go
to
the
bathroom
.
Mr.
Gupta
said
his
father
cried
out
,
“
Take
me
away
from
here.
”
The
hospital
declined
to
comment.As
the
national
government
doled
out
limited
amounts
of
oxygen
,
officials
in
Delhi
grew
increasingly
worried
.
Its
hospitals
had
built
only
one
small
oxygen-generating
plant
because
there
had
previously
been
little
need
,
said
Manish
Sisodia

s
deputy
chief
minister
.
And
Delhi
could
store
only
about
one
day
’
s
worth
of
its
pandemic
needs
at
its
hospitals
and
in
a
city-owned
tank.
“
The
neighborhood
supply
has
long
been
adequate
,
”
Mr.
Sisodia
said
.
“
The
problem
only
came
when
the
plants
that
were
regularly
supplying
Delhi
were
asked
to
apportion
some
to
other
states.
”
He
appealed
to
the
central
government
on
Twitter
,
saying
major
hospitals
had
only
enough
for
a
few
hours.As
supplies
dwindled
,
Delhi
’
s
oxygen
was
increasingly
being
confiscated
by
other
states.On
April
21
,
officials
in
Haryana
State
stopped
a
Delhi-bound
tanker
containing
oxygen
.
Officials
in
Uttar
Pradesh
did
the
same
.
In
Rajasthan
,
officials
briefly
seized
several.The
reason
was
simple
:
People
in
other
states
were
also
dying
from
a
lack
of
oxygen
.
“
If
we
have
any
left
over
,
”
Anil
Vij
,
Haryana
’
s
health
minister
,
said
to
local
media
,
“
then
we
will
give
it.
”
Delhi
sent
police
officers
to
the
Haryana
border
,
and
the
tanker
was
allowed
to
proceed.That
day
,
Delhi
received
only
178
metric
tons
of
liquid
oxygen
—
half
of
what
the
central
government
had
allocated
and
about
a
quarter
of
what
the
city
needed.A
Delhi
court
ordered
the
central
government
to
stop
other
states
from
interfering
with
oxygen
shipments
.
Just
to
make
sure
,
Delhi
began
sending
police
escorts
with
the
oxygen
tankers.To
fill
the
gaps
,
tankers
were
hastily
imported
from
other
countries
,
but
some
were
incompatible
with
Indian
oxygen
tanks
.
Mr.
Sisodia
recalled
his
emergency
response
team
Googling
different
solutions
in
one
frenzied
effort
that
went
from
4
a.m.
to
8
p.m.On
April
21
,
Mr.
Sisodia
called
V.K
.
Bidhuri
,
a
manager
in
Delhi
’
s
oxygen
distribution
office.
“
Sir
,
”
Mr.
Bidhuri
asked
him
,
“
will
we
be
able
to
save
the
people
tonight
?
”
On
April
23
,
the
central
government
sent
Delhi
308
metric
tons
of
oxygen
,
less
than
half
of
its
need.At
Jaipur
Golden
,
all
250
beds
were
full
.
Outside
the
emergency
room
,
patients
slumped
in
wheelchairs
waited
to
be
admitted.Seema
Awasthi
,
a
school
principal
from
north
Delhi
,
was
propped
up
on
her
I.C.U
.
bed
,
a
ventilator
feeding
her
lungs
.
At
8:45
a.m.
,
she
sent
a
text
to
her
family
:
“
I
have
to
be
fine
soon
.
Trying
to
be
strong.
”
That
same
morning
,
Mr.
Modi
huddled
with
the
chief
ministers
of
India
’
s
10
hardest-hit
states.
“
We
fear
a
big
tragedy
may
happen
due
to
the
oxygen
shortage
and
we
will
never
be
able
to
forgive
ourselves
,
”
Delhi
’
s
chief
minister
,
Arvind
Kejriwal
,
told
him
on
the
video
call.Delhi
had
taken
over
the
city
’
s
oxygen
distribution
the
day
before
,
directing
tankers
according
to
need
.
Spreadsheets
showed
the
supplies
each
hospital
had
left.In
desperate
moments
,
officials
could
dispatch
two
city-owned
trucks
with
stopgap
supplies
,
answering
anguished
Twitter
messages
,
texts
or
calls
from
a
doctor
or
a
patient
’
s
relative
.
Though
the
system
would
eventually
be
computerized
,
Mr.
Bidhuri
,
the
oxygen
distribution
official
,
initially
used
a
wire-bound
notebook.Jaipur
Golden
typically
received
its
daily
oxygen
shipment
by
5
p.m.
,
said
Dr.
D.K
.
Baluja
,
its
medical
director
.
This
time
,
though
,
the
truck
didn
’
t
appear
.
At
Inox
,
an
oxygen
supply
company
,
nobody
picked
up
the
phone.Contacted
by
The
Times
,
Inox
said
it
distributed
oxygen
“
per
government
of
Delhi
’
s
instructions.
”
Delhi
officials
said
they
would
supply
records
for
April
23
but
then
did
not.At
7
p.m.
,
Dr.
Baluja
called
Delhi
’
s
oxygen
command
center
.
Officials
said
they
had
none.Jaipur
Golden
was
nearly
out
.
But
employees
and
families
said
they
had
not
been
told
.
Some
family
members
said
they
would
have
sought
canisters
on
Delhi
’
s
streets
had
they
known.Around
7
p.m.
,
Ms.
Bansal
was
summoned
to
the
I.C.U
.
Her
husband
,
Atul
,
had
suffered
a
heart
attack
.
The
oxygen
levels
on
his
ventilator
were
fluctuating
.
He
was
writhing
in
his
bed
,
gasping
for
air.
“
I
couldn
’
t
bear
to
watch
,
”
she
said
.
She
left.At
9:45
p.m.
,
ventilator
alarms
rang
across
the
I.C.U
.
The
oxygen
was
gone.Dr
.
Baluja
later
said
that
Jaipur
Golden
had
a
backup
system
of
50
oxygen
cylinders
.
That
ran
out
,
too
,
he
said.At
10:28
p.m.
,
Ruchika
Gupta
telephoned
from
Amsterdam
to
check
on
her
father
,
Satish
Kumar
Gupta
.
Right
after
the
phone
was
answered
,
the
receiver
was
put
down.
“
Hello
?
Hello
?
”
Ms.
Gupta
asked.No
response.In
the
background
,
she
could
hear
the
ding-ding
of
the
ventilator
alarms
and
someone
muttering
“
Hari
Om
,
Hari
Om
,
Hari
Om
,
”
invoking
God.
“
My
father
was
probably
dying
at
that
moment
,
”
Ms.
Gupta
said.Rohit
Gupta
,
her
brother
,
arrived
at
Jaipur
Golden
around
11:30
p.m
.
It
was
chaos
,
he
said
.
People
dashed
in
carrying
oxygen
cylinders
.
Distraught
relatives
threatened
to
kill
doctors
.
One
man
paced
around
shouting
:
“
I
will
not
leave
these
doctors
alone
if
something
happens
to
my
mother
!
”
Two
tankers
arrived
close
to
midnight
:
a
large
one
from

,
seven
hours
late

it
was

next
morning
,
Dr.

appeared
on

,
weeping.
“
They
were

They

he
said

“
And

”
The
next
week
,
a
Delhi
government
committee
formed
to
look
into
the
deaths
cited
the
“
natural
virulent
course
of
the
disease
”
and
concluded
that
“
shortage
of

as
the
cause
of
death

not
be
ascertained.
”
Mr

Sisodia
acknowledged
that
“
we
should
have
done
better
and
we
should
have
done
more
,
”
but
said
that
his
team
had
saved
thousands
of
lives
.
Jaipur
Golden
,
now
facing
a
lawsuit
from
several

declined
to
comment
further.Many
of
the
families
blame
national

local
and

officials
for

Several
are

NEW
DELHI
—
As
India
gasped
for
air
at
the
peak
of
its
Covid
devastation
,
its
leader
appeared
to
advise
his
people
to
just
breathe
normally.The
instructions
,
a
bit
of
yoga
advice
for
the
stressed
,
came
from
one
of
the
many
social
media
accounts
of
Prime
Minister
Narendra
Modi
,
who
has
used
powerful
oratory
and
digital
savvy
to
become
India
’
s
most
dominant
leader
in
decades
.
But
the
tweet
showed
how
India
’
s
master
of
public
perception
has
increasingly
struggled
to
get
his
message
across
,
exposing
the
limits
of
his
ability
to
control
the
narrative.The
omnipresent
Mr.
Modi
had
largely
vanished
from
public
view
as
his
government
proved
powerless
to
stop
the
deaths
and
the
mounting
criticism
about
his
performance
.
With
his
poll
numbers
dropping
and
his
allies
straining
to
make
his
case
on
India
’
s
talk
shows
,
he
and
his
minders
have
increasingly
pushed
“
be
positive
”
messaging
and
feel-good
tips.The
campaign
has
struggled
to
connect
.
“
Sit
in
a
comfortable
meditative
posture
,
”
read
a
tweet
from
one
of
Mr.
Modi
’
s
many
accounts
,
which
project
his
diverse
set
of
personas
—
this
one
the
wise
yoga
guru
.
“
Keep
the
spine
erect
.
Place
the
hands
on
the
thighs
.
Gently
close
the
eyes
and
raise
the
face
slightly
.
Breathe
normally.
”
Responded
one
commenter
:
“
This
is
like
rubbing
salt
on
wounds.
”
In
turn
,
Mr.
Modi
has
tried
to
quash
dissent
.
His
government
has
been
locked
in
a
messy
showdown
with
social
media
platforms
over
taking
down
critical
content
.
The
police
in
Delhi
,
the
capital
,
arrested
at
least
20
people
for
putting
up
posters
critical
of
Mr.
Modi
’
s
handling
of
vaccinations
.
A
Modi
protégé
,
who
leads
India
’
s
most
populous
state
,
Uttar
Pradesh
,
threatened
those
who
complained
about
oxygen
shortages.On
Monday
,
as
India
’
s
official
death
and
infection
figures
were
falling
,
Mr.
Modi
tried
to
seize
the
moment
and
change
the
narrative
.
In
a
rare
televised
address
since
the
second
wave
began
in
April
,
he
declared
that
the
central
government
would
help
all
900
million
adults
get
free
vaccines
,
a
reversal
of
his
earlier
policy
that
had
forced
state
governments
into
a
chaotic
competition
over
limited
supplies
.
A
spokesman
said
Mr.
Modi
had
been
too
busy
with
“
silent
work
and
work
and
work
”
to
appear
in
public
during
the
pandemic.Mr
.
Modi
’
s
positivity
push
appears
to
be
an
attempt
to
drown
out
dissatisfaction
.
One
survey
found
disapproval
with
Mr.
Modi
rising
by
about
10
percentage
points
since
the
second
wave
intensified
.
In
another
survey
,
one
in
six
people
said
they
had
lost
a
loved
one
and
blamed
the
central
government
first
,
and
then
“
destiny
,
”
for
their
loss.
“
So
much
death
,
so
much
despair
—
children
lost
their
parents
overnight
,
elderly
parents
lost
their
young
children
,
people
lost
their
spouses
,
”
said
Shruti
Chaturvedi
,
an
entrepreneur
doing
relief
work
in
the
state
of
Goa
.
“
How
can
we
dare
tell
them
‘
be
positive
’
?
”
Mr
.
Modi
’
s
approval
rating
is
still
above
60
percent
,
according
to
one
poll
.
But
the
growing
dissatisfaction
suggests
the
prime
minister
may
not
so
easily
be
able
to
change
public
sentiment
by
pushing
emotional
nationalist
causes
or
shifting
his
image
as
he
has
done
in
the
past
.
Rather
,
like
any
other
politician
,
he
may
increasingly
be
judged
by
his
ability
to
deliver.
“
There
was
a
template
—
that
if
you
invisibilize
problems
you
do
not
want
to
focus
on
and
convince
the
rest
of
the
population
that
only
the
visible
part
is
the
entire
part
,
that
seemed
to
work
in
the
past
,
”
said
Kota
Neelima
,
the
founder
of
the
Institute
of
Perception
Studies
in
New
Delhi
.
But
in
a
once-in-a-century
catastrophe
,
she
said
,
“
you
actually
notice
the
government
is
absent.
”
Perhaps
the
most
telling
criticism
has
come
from
the
Rashtriya
Swayamsevak
Sangh
,
a
powerful
organization
with
millions
of
members
that
has
long
supported
turning
India
into
a
Hindu
state
and
that
has
placed
its
hopes
in
Mr.
Modi.The
R.S.S
.
recently
tried
to
help
the
positivity
campaign
by
holding
a
series
of
lectures
by
influential
figures
called
“
Positivity
Unlimited.
”
But
in
his
own
speech
,
Mohan
Bhagwat
,
the
R.S.S
.
chief
,
couldn
’
t
entirely
deflect
blame
from
Mr.
Modi
’
s
administration
:
Both
the
government
and
the
people
had
lowered
their
guard
,
he
said.Mr
.
Modi
picked
up
many
of
his
skills
as
a
communicator
as
an
R.S.S
.
volunteer
,
said
Badri
Narayan
,
a
social
historian
and
political
analyst
who
has
written
extensively
about
the
group
.
Its
“
language
of
mobilization
”
emphasizes
storytelling
loaded
with
symbolism
echoing
thousands
of
years
of
history.
“
He
was
trained
in
that
pedagogy
of
oratory
,
”
Mr.
Narayan
said
.
“
He
came
to
learn
how
to
use
storytelling
for
bigger
messaging
,
and
he
evolved
that
training
in
his
own
ways.
”
How
Mr.
Modi
will
emerge
from
the
pandemic
could
depend
on
those
talents
,
which
have
bailed
him
out
in
the
past.To
become
prime
minister
,
Mr.
Modi
overcame
a
reputation
tarnished
by
his
alleged
involvement
in
fanning
religious
violence
when
he
was
chief
minister
of
the
state
of
Gujarat
two
decades
ago
.
For
a
time
,
he
was
banned
from
entering
the
United
States
on
grounds
that
he
had
violated
religious
freedoms
.
He
successfully
rebranded
himself
as
the
Hindu
nationalist
who
could
be
India
’
s
development
champion
.
Soon
after
winning
election
in
2014
,
he
traveled
to
New
York
and
spoke
for
an
hour
in
a
packed
Madison
Square
Garden
to
chants
of
“
Modi
!
Modi
!
Modi
!
”
In
seven
years
as
prime
minister
,
he
has
tightly
controlled
his
image
.
He
prefers
choreographed
rallies
and
selective
interviews
over
news
conferences
,
avoiding
vulnerability
while
offering
plenty
of
content
for
his
social
media
apparatus
and
network
of
celebrity
supporters.In
the
face
of
crisis
,
Mr.
Modi
has
displayed
a
talent
of
inventing
a
new
narrative
and
switching
personas
,
including
combative
national
champion
,
digital
leader
and
spiritual
guide
.
At
times
he
could
seem
deeply
relatable
,
at
others
above
it
all
.
And
he
had
what
the
opposition
lacked
:
an
ability
to
take
his
message
viral.During
the
2019
election
,
with
the
economy
weakening
,
he
emphasized
the
threat
from
Pakistan
.
Referring
to
an
earlier
comment
Mr.
Modi
had
made
,
his
party
projected
him
as
the
nation
’
s
toughest
“
watchman
,
”
boasting
about
the
size
of
Mr.
Modi
’
s
chest
as
a
sign
of
his
strength.Just
before
the
voting
,
he
visited
a
temple
and
went
to
meditate
in
a
cave
,
emphasizing
his
religious
devotion
.
The
path
was
covered
by
a
red
carpet
and
surrounded
by
cameras
.
There
were
even
photos
and
footage
of
the
meditating
Mr.
Modi
inside
the
small
cave.After
last
year
’
s
first
wave
of
the
virus
,
Mr.
Modi
declared
victory
,
saying
India
“
with
a
proactive
approach
”
had
saved
“
the
entire
humanity
from
a
big
tragedy.
”
He
transitioned
to
an
image
of
a
wise
man
at
the
service
of
the
nation
.
He
grew
his
beard
.
His
office
posted
a
video
of
Mr.
Modi
feeding
baby
peacocks
,
strolling
with
full-plumage
adult
birds
and
perusing
documents
with
one
at
his
feet.When
the
second
wave
struck
,
Mr.
Modi
was
on
the
campaign
trail
,
boasting
about
crowd
sizes
and
ripping
into
opponents
.
Experts
now
say
those
rallies
undermined
social
distancing
warnings.Mr
.
Modi
and
his
allies
have
tried
to
drown
out
the
negative
voices
as
they
scramble
to
address
a
catastrophic
oxygen
shortage
and
mismanaged
vaccine
supplies
.
The
main
tactic
appears
to
be
the
threat
of
bogging
down
critics
in
India
’
s
labyrinthine
judicial
system.In
Delhi
,
the
central
government
’
s
police
arrested
more
than
20
people
last
month
for
putting
up
posters
critical
of
Mr.
Modi
’
s
handling
of
the
vaccination
drive
.
The
posters
were
made
by
the
party
that
governs
Delhi
,
which

But
the
arrests
for
a
simple
act
of
protest
in
the

s
capital
sent
shock
waves.Mr

Modi
may
now
be
judged
less
by
his
rhetoric
and
ideology
and
more
by
his

said
Mr.

the

“
The

is
going
to
shift

”
Mr.
Narayan
said

“
He
is
talking

so
he
has
to
talk
about

NEW
DELHI
—
Amitesh
Prasad
,
a
pilot
with
Air
India
,
came
down
with
Covid-like
symptoms
in
April
this
year
after
he
flew
from
San
Francisco
to
the
southern
Indian
city
of
Bengaluru
.
He
was
among
the
many
pilots
who
had
worked
on
one
of
India
’
s
largest
humanitarian
missions
to
bring
home
stranded
residents
and
transport
essential
pandemic-related
supplies.He
died
on
May
9
,
one
of
at
least
17
pilots
in
India
who
have
died
of
the
coronavirus
,
according
to
the
Indian
Pilots
’
Guild
,
a
union
of
about
350
pilots
in
the
country
.
Almost
half
of
them
flew
with
Air
India
and
the
rest
with
private
airlines
,
including
Indigo
,
Go
Air
and
Vistara
,
it
said.The
Air
India
pilots
had
their
salaries
reduced
during
the
pandemic
,
their
union
says
,
and
it
points
out
that
many
of
them
came
to
India
’
s
aid
when
people
and
vaccines
needed
to
be
transported
,
even
though
they
were
not
vaccinated
themselves.Now
,
the
country
’
s
pilots
,
especially
those
working
for
Air
India
,
the
debt-ridden
airline
controlled
by
Prime
Minister
Narendra
Modi
’
s
government
,
are
asking
for
better
compensation
for
the
families
of
airline
crew
members
who
die
of
Covid.On
Monday
,
the
Federation
of
Indian
Pilots
,
a
pan-India
organization
of
pilots
,
filed
a
public
interest
lawsuit
in
the
Bombay
High
Court
,
seeking
better
compensation
,
insurance
benefits
and
vaccination
for
all
airline
crew
members.The
federation
said
in
its
petition
that
as
of
February
this
year
,
nearly
2,000
Air
India
staff
members
had
tested
positive
for
Covid-19
.
More
than
500
of
them
required
hospitalization.
“
However
,
there
is
no
scheme
for
adequate
compensation
to
pilots
in
case
of
their
demise
,
”
the
federation
said
.
It
added
that
“
there
is
no
insurance
scheme
or
any
other
such
scheme
providing
safety
net
to
the
pilots.
”
In
a
letter
addressed
to
the
chairman
and
managing
director
of
Air
India
last
month
,
the
Indian
Pilots
’
Guild
said
that
the
country
lost
three
pilots
in
just
a
span
of
five
days
between
April
9
and
14.It
asked
the
state
carrier
some
pointed
questions
:
“
Until
how
long
will
our
service
to
the
nation
be
taken
for
granted
considering
the
pay
cut
and
the
lack
of
recognition
of
our
contribution
throughout
the
pandemic
?
”
The
union
said
Air
India
was
paying
about
500,000
to
1
million
rupees
(
$
6,800
to
$
13,700
)
as
compensation
to
the
family
if
a
pilot
died
of
Covid-19
while
performing
their
duties
.
The
number
,
it
said
,
was
a
fraction
of
what
other
airlines
paid
and
might
be
just
enough
to
take
care
of
a
deceased
colleague
’
s
hospital
bills
.
Indigo
,
a
private
airline
,
was
paying
50
million
rupees
or
more
than
$
680,000
,
the
union
said
in
one
of
its
letters.The
union
said
that
it
had
sent
repeated
requests
to
the
government
asking
that
flight
crews
be
prioritized
for
vaccinations
.
In
a
letter
addressed
to
India
’
s
health
minister
,
Dr.
Harsh
Vardhan
,
on
April
16
,
the
union
urged
the
government
to
recognize
crew
members
as
“
essential
workers.
”
“
We
urge
you
to
vaccinate
all
aircrew
at
the
earliest
,
”
it
said.Two
Air
India
pilots
who
requested
anonymity
fearing
reprisals
from
the
government
said
they
were
frustrated
by
the
way
their
calls
for
better
compensation
and
protesting
salary
cuts
had
fallen
on
deaf
ears
.
They
also
said
they
feared
being
exposed
to
new
variants
of
the
virus
circulating
in
other
countries
while
doing
their
jobs.Despite
all
of
that
,
the
pilots
said
they
were
being
paid
salaries
that
were
nearly
40
to
70
percent
less
than
what
they
received
before
the
pandemic
.
The
pay
cuts
came
into
effect
in
April
last
year
as
global
travel
came
to
a
halt.Hardeep

“

he
said
in

on
Tuesday.But
neither
Mr.
Puri

Air
India
have
responded
to
their

requests
.
The
Ministry
of
Civil
Aviation
in
New
Delhi
didn
’
t
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment.In
May
,
the
union
wrote
a
letter
to
Air
India
,
asking
company
executives
to
show
“
a
similar
kindness
”
to
what
it
showed
when
it
asked
its

to
show
up
for
duty
when
it

rescue
Indians
from
some
of
the
worst-affected
regions
in
the
world
,
including
the
United

,
China
and

“
The

,
India
—
The
Ganges
,
or
Ganga
,
is
the
holiest
of
India
’
s
rivers
,
and
most
Hindus
believe
that
dipping
their
body
in
it
will
purify
their
soul
.
But
when
the
second
wave
of
the
Covid-19
pandemic
hit
this
spring
,
the
river
also
became
Exhibit
A
for
the
Modi
administration
’
s
failures
and
deceptions.The
northern
state
of
Bihar
recently
revised
its
death
toll
for
April
and
May
from
5,424
to
9,375
.
Private
agencies
tasked
with
conducting
coronavirus
tests
at
Kumbh
Mela
,
a
Hindu
religious
festival
in
northern
India
that
attracted
millions
of
pilgrims
in
April
—
and
turned
out
to
be
a
coronavirus
superspreader
event
—
reportedly
falsified
some
100,000
results.The
second
wave
of
infections
appears
to
be
ebbing
,
but
the
country
is
struggling
to
process
the
staggering
toll
—
nearly
380,000
people
dead
,
the
vast
majority
since
just
March
—
hobbled
by
the
continuing
obfuscation
of
both
local
and
central
authorities
.
But
the
holy
Ganges
does
not
lie.On
May
12
,
villagers
in
Buxar
,
a
district
in
Bihar
,
found
bloated
and
disfigured
corpses
floating
in
the
river
.
Some
100
bodies
were
fished
out
there
and
in
a
district
upstream
,
Ghazipur
.
A
local
senior
police
officer
said
the
bodies
had
traveled
downriver
from
Uttar
Pradesh
,
India
’
s
most
populous
state.I
am
the
national
editor
of
Dainik
Bhaskar
,
a
Hindi-language
newspaper
that
sells
about
five
and
a
half
million
copies
a
day
across
India
,
mostly
to
readers
in
small
towns
and
villages
.
To
get
a
clearer
sense
of
the
devastation
caused
by
the
pandemic
among
them
,
we
sent
30
reporters
and
photojournalists
to
walk
the
banks
of
the
Ganges
in
major
cities
and
districts
in
Uttar
Pradesh.Our
reporters
counted
2,000
bodies
on
May
12
and
13
alone
as
they
traveled
700
miles
along
the
river
.
The
bodies
weren
’
t
only
floating
in
it
;
on
some
days
,
65
or
70
were
washing
up
on
its
shores
.
Yet
by
our
calculations
,
based
on
official
data
,
the
state
authorities
claim
that
just
7,826
people
died
from
Covid-19
from
April
1
to
May
13.Shringverpur
,
a
small
village
in
southern
Uttar
Pradesh
,
is
considered
holy
for
its
association
with
Lord
Rama
,
a
Hindu
deity
and
the
protagonist
of
the
epic
poem
“
Ramayana.
”
Our
reporters
saw
many
bodies
buried
just
a
yard
apart
;
hundreds
of
saffron
shrouds
wrapped
around
the
corpses
were
poking
up
from
the
ground
.
Poor
villagers
who
couldn
’
t
afford
to
buy
wood
to
cremate
their
kin
had
sought
some
solace
by
burying
them
near
a
sacred
site.After
more
reporting
,
we
estimated
that
between
mid-April
and
mid-May
some
4,000
corpses
had
been
placed
in
shallow
pits
by
the
river
along
a
stretch
of
less
than
one
mile.We
might
never
have
heard
of
this
tragedy
but
for
the
weather
.
Rains
in
early
May
swelled
the
Ganges
,
tossing
corpses
up
to
the
river
’
s
surface
and
onto
its
shores
.
They
washed
dirt
from
the
banks
,
exposing
the
bodies
buried
there.The
rains
also
laid
bare
the
government
’
s
colossal
failure
to
strengthen
rural
health
care
or
ensure
adequate
vaccine
supplies
—
or
take
responsibility
for
its
shortcomings.Uttar
Pradesh
has
been
governed
by
the
Bharatiya
Janata
Party
of
Prime
Minister
Narendra
Modi
since
March
2017
,
under
Chief
Minister
Yogi
Adityanath
,
a
Hindu
monk
turned
politician
.
Mr.
Adityanath
’
s
response
in
April
to
grave
shortages
of
oxygen
,
ventilators
and
beds
in
intensive
care
units
throughout
the
state
and
to
the
images
of
overcrowded
cemeteries
and
crematories
was
to
issue
denials
and
threats
.
He
directed
state
officials
to
invoke
antiterrorism
laws
against
and
seize
property
from
people
he
accused
of
spreading
rumors.The
Uttar
Pradesh
government
records
only
deaths
in
hospitals
.
Yet
many
people
from
villages
,
where
access
to
health
care
is
limited
,
have
been
dying
at
home.In
mid-May
,
a
doctor
in
Reotipur
,
a
town
of
about
70,000
in
Ghazipur
—
the
only
doctor
there
—
told
one
of
our
reporters
that
about
850
people
had
tested
positive
for
the
coronavirus
.
Some
residents
told
him
that
around
200
people
there
died
in
April.
“
We
are
poor
people
,
”
Mahendranath
Upadhyay
,
who
lost
three
members
of
his
family
to
Covid-19
,
told
our
reporter
.
“
We
barely
manage
to
earn
enough
to
eat
.
We
don
’
t
have
the
money
for
medical
treatment.
”
Rural
poverty
has
exacerbated
the
effects
of
the
second
wave
of
infections
,
but
it
was
the
Modi
government
’
s
callous
disregard
that
triggered
the
latest
surge
.
The
authorities
allowed
the
Kumbh
Mela
pilgrimage
,
one
of
the
world
’
s
largest
religious
gatherings
,
in
the
spring
,
as
well
as
elections
in
several
states
,
including
Uttar
Pradesh.And
now
,
with
just
3.4
percent
of
Indians
fully
vaccinated
,
there
is
good
reason
to
fear
a
devastating
third
wave.When
Mr.
Modi
campaigned
to
become
prime
minister
in
2014
,
he
ran
for
a
parliamentary
seat
from
Varanasi
,
a
holy
city
on
the
Ganges
in
Uttar
Pradesh
.
He
said
then
,
“
I
feel
Mother
Ganga
has
called
me
to
Varanasi.
”
Today
,
the
Ganges
is
calling
him
out.When
the
coronavirus
hit
,
the
Serum
Institute
of
India
seemed
uniquely
positioned
to
help
.
It
is
world
’
s
largest
vaccine
maker
,
producing
1.5
billion
doses
a
year
for
diseases
from
polio
to
tetanus
.
Striking
a
deal
with
AstraZeneca
,
its
leaders
promised
to
make
and
deliver
a
billion
doses
of
vaccine
to
low-
and
middle-income
nations
.
Earlier
this
year
,
however
,
a
second
wave
of
the
coronavirus
hit
India
hard
and
Prime
Minister
Narendra
Modi
decided
to
ban
all
exports
of
vaccines
.
What
has
this
ban
meant
for
the
nations
that
were
promised
millions
of
doses
,
and
for
the
Serum
Institute
itself
?
India
administered
8.6
million
doses
of
Covid
vaccines
on
Monday
,
setting
a
national
record
on
the
first
day
of
a
new
policy
that
offers
free
vaccines
for
all
adults
and
aims
to
energize
a
lackluster
inoculation
effort.Despite
a
slow
start
characterized
by
supply
shortages
and
bickering
between
the
states
and
central
government
,
officials
say
that
vaccine
production
and
procurement
are
being
accelerated
to
ensure
that
all
of
India
’
s
roughly
950
million
adults
are
fully
vaccinated
by
the
end
of
the
year.Monday
’
s
total
was
the
most
Covid
shots
given
in
a
single
day
in
any
country
besides
China
,
and
the
surge
may
have
been
partly
because
the
vaccines
were
widely
available
and
free
for
the
first
time
to
those
younger
than
45.Local
news
reports
have
also
suggested
that
Monday
’
s
record
may
have
been
made
possible
by
holding
back
vaccines
in
some
states
run
by
the
governing
party
of
Prime
Minister
Narendra
Modi
.
In
one
state
,
Madhya
Pradesh
,
the
number
of
administered
doses
had
shrunk
to
just
692
a
day
before
the
start
of
the
new
policy
on
Monday
,
when
1.6
million
doses
were
suddenly
administered.And
the
boost
was
probably
temporary
—
available
supplies
suggest
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
sustain
such
a
pace
over
the
coming
weeks
.
India
has
increased
the
availability
of
doses
to
120
million
this
month
,
from
about
75
million
in
May
.
About
135
million
doses
are
expected
to
be
available
in
July.The
inoculation
drive
relies
almost
entirely
on
two
vaccines
manufactured
in
India
,
and
government
officials
have
said
that
the
companies
behind
those
vaccines
,
the
Serum
Institute
of
India
and
Bharat
Biotech
,
have
promised
to
deliver
a
total
of
about
1.3
billion
doses
from
August
to
the
end
of
the
year
.
The
remaining
doses
are
expected
to
come
from
other
vaccines
still
under
assessment
or
trial.In
India
,
a
nation
of
about
1.4
billion
people
,
the
task
ahead
remains
enormous
.
Although
the
country
has
administered
nearly
290
million
doses
of
vaccines
so
far
,
according
to
government
data
,
less
than
5
percent
of
the
population
is
fully
vaccinated
.
Less
than
20
percent
of
people
have
received
at
least
one
dose.The
government
has
worked
to
iron
out
supply
issues
and
ease
online
registration
requirements
that
have
hampered
vaccine
access
,
especially
in
parts
of
the
country
where
smartphone
and
internet
availability
are
spotty
.
Still
,
vaccine
hesitancy
—
born
of
local
superstitions
,
as
well
as
misinformation
spread
by
some
political
and
religious
leaders
—
could
be
another
hurdle
for
India
before
it
meets
its
ambitious
goal
of
inoculating
all
adults
by
the
end
of
the
year.The
effort
to
ramp
up
vaccinations
comes
as
the
worst
of
India
’
s
devastating
second
wave
appears
to
be
over
,
with
most
of
India
’
s
major
cities
easing
restrictions
and
reopening
the
economy
.
India
reported
about
42,000
new
cases
on
Monday
,
down
from
a
peak
of
more
than
400,000
in
early
May
.
The
weekly
test
positivity
rate
has
remained
below
5
percent
for
two
consecutive
weeks
,
a
sign
that
undetected
cases
in
the
population
are
also
decreasing.At
least
390,000
people
have
died
of
Covid
in
India
,
according
to
official
figures
,
although
experts
believe
that
is
a
significant
undercount
.
Members
of
the
global
Indian
diaspora
,
nearly
17
million
,
have
mobilized
from
afar
to
help
back
home
,
where
the
Indian
health
system
is
buckling
under
the
weight
of
a
devastating
coronavirus
wave
.
Here
is
one
U.S.
resident
’
s
story.The
calls
come
at
all
hours
,
sometimes
15
a
day
,
from
some
of
India
’
s
most
oppressed
and
severely
ill
people
,
buzzing
a
cellphone
that
belongs
to
Dolly
Arjun
,
an
Indian-American
physician
assistant
in
Boston.A
few
years
ago
,
Ms.
Arjun
founded
a
telehealth
program
to
provide
free
health
care
to
members
of
India
’
s
Indigenous
tribes
and
to
Dalits
,
who
are
at
the
lowest
rungs
of
India
’
s
entrenched
caste
system
and
have
long
faced
discrimination
.
Dalits
are
typically
the
last
to
receive
assistance
in
humanitarian
disasters
and
often
live
in
impoverished
rural
villages
with
no
hospitals
,
medical
care
or
schools.Now
,
with
a
devastating
wave
of
coronavirus
infections
surging
across
India
,
Dalits
are
facing
a
new
peril
,
Ms.
Arjun
said
.
She
said
she
was
desperate
to
help
,
even
though
she
is
emotionally
exhausted
after
a
year
of
working
with
Covid-19
patients
in
Massachusetts.
“
Tons
of
people
are
dying
,
”
Ms.
Arjun
said
.
“
This
is
just
a
human
to
human
need.
”
Her
focus
is
not
just
Hippocratic
.
She
is
Dalit
herself
,
a
rarity
among
Indian
medical
professionals
in
the
United
States
,
most
of
whom
come
from
upper-caste
urban
families
.
“
The
only
reason
they
might
know
a
Dalit
person
is
because
it
’
s
their
servant
at
home
,
”
Ms.
Arjun
said.Her
telemedicine
program
has
health
workers
in
India
who
can
translate
for
patients
in
local
languages
,
but
finding
medical
professionals
in
the
United
States
to
join
the
effort
has
not
been
easy
,
she
said
.
Still
,
Ms.
Arjun
has
recruited
two
physicians.Patients
contact
the
group
through
WhatsApp
,
Facebook
and
YouTube
,
and
the
medical
professionals
call
back
on
video
.
Often
their
first
task
is
to
reassure
patients
who
have
little
understanding
of
the
coronavirus
or
the
appropriate
medical
treatments
,
Ms.
Arjun
said.
“
Part
of
what
’
s
happening
now
is
patients
are
being
told
Covid
is
going
to
kill
you
,
so
they
are
panicked
,
”
Ms.
Arjun
said.She
noted
that
in
one
Indian
state
the
government
has
been
broadly
distributing
packets
of
medications
—
including
25
days-worth
of
antibiotics
,
which
can
not
treat
viruses
—
to
residents
,
regardless
of
whether
they
have
tested
positive
for
Covid-19
or
show
symptoms.Sometimes
,
however
,
the
telehealth
calls
detect
life-or-death
emergencies
.
In
late
April
,
Ms.
Arjun
logged
onto
a
WhatsApp
video
call
with
a
young
Dalit
man
and
his
60-year-old
father
,
who
was
at
home
with
breathing
problems
in
the
central
Indian
state
of
Madhya
Pradesh
,
where
it
was
around
midnight.
“
They
didn
’
t
know
what
to
do
,
”
she
said
.
“
They
told
us
there
were
no
hospitals
or
oxygen
available
,
and
they
hadn
’
t
seen
a
doctor.
”
After
assessing
the
man
,
Ms.
Arjun
urged
the
family
to
check
to
see
whether
any
hospital
beds
were
available
instead
of
assuming
that
they
were
full
.
“
It
took
a
lot
of
convincing
,
”
she
said.The
next
day
,
he
was
admitted
and
began
to
improve
,
but
the
hospital
was
running
out
of
oxygen
.
Ms.
Arjun
put
out
a
call
on
several
WhatsApp
groups
for
an
oxygen
cylinder
,
though
the
family
did
not
know
the
name
of
the
hospital
and
then
fell
out
of
contact.Days
later
,
she
learned
that
the
man
had
died.NEW
DELHI
—
Doctors
in
India
are
concerned
about
an
increasing
number
of
potentially
fatal
fungal
infections
affecting
either
people
who
have
Covid-19
or
those
who
have
recently
recovered
from
the
disease.The
condition
,
known
as
mucormycosis
,
has
a
high
mortality
rate
and
was
present
in
India
before
the
pandemic
.
It
is
caused
by
a
mold
that
thrives
in
wet
environments
and
can
attack
through
the
respiratory
tract
,
potentially
eroding
facial
structures
and
harming
the
brain.The
condition
is
relatively
rare
,
but
doctors
and
medical
experts
say
it
seems
to
be
infecting
some
Covid
patients
whose
weakened
immune
systems
and
underlying
conditions
,
particularly
diabetes
,
leave
them
vulnerable.Some
experts
attribute
the
fungal
infections
to
an
increased
use
of
steroids
to
treat
hospitalized
patients
.
Another
factor
could
be
that
,
with
hospitals
overwhelmed
in
this
second
wave
of
the
pandemic
,
many
families
are
self-medicating
and
applying
oxygen
therapy
at
home
without
the
proper
hygiene
,
experts
say.In
the
western
state
of
Maharashtra
,
which
includes
the
commercial
hub
of
Mumbai
and
has
been
badly
devastated
by
the
pandemic
,
local
news
media
reported
that
around
200
patients
who
had
recovered
from
Covid
were
being
treated
for
mucormycosis
and
that
eight
had
died.In
Gujarat
,
a
western
state
north
of
Maharashtra
,
the
state
government
ordered
the
allocation
of
separate
wards
in
hospitals
for
the
treatment
of
the
infection
,
and
said
it
had
put
purchase
orders
for
5,000
doses
of
amphotericin
B
,
a
medicine
used
to
treat
it
.
Infections
have
also
been
reported
in
hospitals
in
the
country
’
s
capital
,
New
Delhi.Health
experts
are
keeping
close
tabs
on
the
situation
.
“
We
have
heard
that
in
some
areas
,
people
who
are
Covid-infected
or
recovered
suffer
from
mucormycosis
,
but
there
is
not
a
big
outbreak
of
it
,
”
Dr.
V.K
.
Paul
,
who
heads
India
’
s
Covid
task
force
,
said
last
week
.
“
We
are
watching
and
monitoring.
”
“
It
is
a
fungus
that
has
a
strong
relation
to
diabetes
,
”
he
added
.
“
If
the
person
is
not
diabetic
,
it
is
very
uncommon
that
the
person
would
have
mucormycosis.
”
Many
less-populous
countries
have
higher
percentages
of
diabetes
,
but
only
one
—
China
,
with
a
population
even
larger
than
India
’
s
1.38
billion
—
has
a
higher
raw
number
of
diabetics
.
In
India
,
more
than
10
percent
of
the
adult
population
has
the
condition
,
or
77
million
people
.
China
has
more
than
116
million
adult
diabetics
,
or
9
percent
,
according
to
the
2019
International
Diabetes
Foundation
Atlas.Dr
.
K.
Srinath
Reddy
,
who
leads
the
Public
Health
Foundation
of
India
,
said
a
large
number
of
the
recent
reported
mucormycosis
cases
were
of
hospitalized
coronavirus
patients
who
had
been
discharged
after
their
recovery.
“
You
are
using
steroids
to
reduce
the
hyperimmune
response
,
which
is
there
in
Covid
,
”
Dr.
Reddy
said
.
“
But
you
are
reducing
the
resistance
to
other
infections.

NEW
DELHI
—
Twitter
pushed
back
on
Thursday
against
India
’
s
increasingly
heavy-handed
efforts
to
control
online
speech
,
calling
on
the
government
to
respect
freedom
of
expression
and
criticizing
what
it
called
“
intimidation
tactics
”
by
the
country
’
s
police.The
statement
comes
as
the
Indian
government
under
Prime
Minister
Narendra
Modi
faces
mounting
pressure
for
its
handling
of
a
devastating
second
wave
of
the
coronavirus
.
Many
of
those
complaints
have
been
aired
on
Twitter
and
elsewhere
online.The
government
has
moved
to
reclaim
the
narrative
by
quashing
free
speech
online
.
On
Thursday
,
Twitter
said
it
had
received
a
notice
of
noncompliance
with
India
’
s
information
technology
laws
.
The
notice
asked
the
company
to
remove
content
critical
of
the
government
’
s
handling
of
the
coronavirus
and
about
farmers
’
protests
,
including
some
posted
by
journalists
,
activists
and
politicians.Under
Indian
law
,
Twitter
’
s
executives
in
India
could
face
up
to
seven
years
in
prison
if
the
company
fails
to
abide
by
government
orders
to
remove
content
that
it
considers
subversive
or
a
threat
to
public
order
and
national
security.In
its
statement
,
the
San
Francisco-based
social
media
service
said
it
planned
to
push
leaders
in
India
to
change
new
regulations
that
have
given
the
authorities
greater
say
over
online
platforms.
“
Right
now
,
we
are
concerned
by
recent
events
regarding
our
employees
in
India
and
the
potential
threat
to
freedom
of
expression
for
the
people
we
serve
,
”
the
statement
read.Citing
the
new
information
technology
regulations
,
it
added
that
“
we
,
alongside
many
in
civil
society
in
India
and
around
the
world
,
have
concerns
with
regards
to
the
use
of
intimidation
tactics
by
the
police
in
response
to
enforcement
of
our
global
terms
of
service
,
as
well
as
with
core
elements
of
the
new
I.T
.
rules.
”
Days
earlier
,
officers
belonging
to
an
elite
antiterrorism
police
unit
visited
Twitter
’
s
New
Delhi
offices
,
bearing
a
notice
protesting
the
way
the
company
had
labeled
posts
by
senior
officials
within
India
’
s
ruling
Bharatiya
Janata
Party
,
or
B.J.P.Those
officials
had
posted
documents
on
Twitter
that
they
said
provided
proof
that
the
opposition
politicians
were
planning
to
use
the
country
’
s
coronavirus
crisis
as
a
political
cudgel
.
Twitter
labeled
them
“
manipulated
media
”
in
response
to
accusations
that
the
documents
had
been
forged.Even
before
the
coronavirus
hit
,
Mr.
Modi
’
s
government
and
the
B.J.P
.
had
taken
increasingly
strong
steps
to
curb
dissent
in
the
country
of
1.4
billion.In
February
,
Twitter
blocked
over
500
accounts
and
removed
an
unspecified
number
of
others
in
India
after
the
government
accused
those
accounts
of
making
inflammatory
remarks
about
Mr.
Modi
in
connection
with
protests
by
angry
farmers
.
The
farmers
have
been
camping
outside
New
Delhi
for
at
least
six
months
to
protest
agriculture
laws.Twitter
had
said
earlier
that
it
wouldn
’
t
take
any
action
against
accounts
that
belonged
to
media
organizations
,
journalists
,
activists
or
politicians
,
and
that
it
did
not
believe
the
orders
to
block
those
accounts
were
“
consistent
with
Indian
law.
”
But
on
Thursday
,
the
company
acknowledged
it
withheld
some
unverified
accounts
in
those
categories
from
view
in
India
,
even
though
it
believed
the
content
to
be
“
legitimate
free
speech
”
under
Indian
and
international
law
.
The
company
said
last
week
that
it
was
reopening
its
verification
process
to
allow
government
officials
,
media
organizations
,
journalists
and
activists
to
apply
for
a
blue
check
mark
,
a
marker
of
credibility
online
,
a
process
that
has
been
on
hold
since
2017.In
April
,
Mr.
Modi
’
s
government
ordered
Facebook
,
Instagram
and
Twitter
to
take
down
dozens
of
social
media
posts
that
were
critical
of
its
handling
of
the
pandemic
.
The
order
was
aimed
at
roughly
100
posts
from
opposition
politicians
and
included
calls
for
Mr.
Modi
to
resign.The
new
internet
rules
in
India
apply
to
a
wide
variety
of
media
,
including
digital
news
outlets
,
streaming
services
like
Netflix
and
Amazon
,
and
social
media
platforms
,
giving
the
government
sweeping
powers
to
quickly
take
down
articles
,
posts
or
any
other
material
.
It
specifically
requires
social
media
companies
to
appoint
Indian-based
executives
who
could
be
held
criminally
liable
for
any
violations
,
as
well
as
create
systems
to
trace
and
identify
the
“
first
originator
”
of
posts
or
messages
that
the
government
deems
“
offensive.
”
Under
the
regulations
,
announced
in
February
,
the
social
media
companies
were
given
a
deadline
,
which
was
Tuesday
,
to
name
the
executives
who
could
be
held
liable.Twitter
called
the
requirement
a
“
dangerous
overreach
that
is
inconsistent
with
open
,
democratic
principles.
”
On
Wednesday
,
WhatsApp
sued
the
Indian
government
in
a
highly
unusual
step
by
the
Facebook-owned
messaging
platform
,
arguing
the
guidelines
were
unconstitutional
.
Lawyers
and
digital
rights
groups
say
the
rules
threaten
to
fundamentally
change
the
way
Indians
use
the
internet.
“
The
I.T
.
rules
are
against
India
’
s
democratic
framework
and
constitutional
guarantees
,
”
said
Apar
Gupta
,
the
executive
director
of
the
Internet
Freedom
Foundation
,
a
rights
group
.
“
Several
requirements
under
them
suffer
from
unconstitutionality
and
undermine
free
expression
and
privacy
for
millions
of
internet
users
in
India.
”
India
is
not
the
only
country
that
has
sought
to
enforce
stronger
regulations
on
the
internet
.
The
moves
have
provoked
questions
about
balancing
free
speech
with
safety
and
privacy.In
the
United
States
,
politicians
have
taken
aim
at
big
technology
companies
like
Facebook
and
Amazon
for
their
influence
over
what
people
buy
and
read
,
as
well
as
how
the
companies
handle
users
’
personal
data
.
European
officials
are
working
on
new
laws
that
would
provide
the
government
with
greater
authority
to
remove
misinformation
and
other
material
considered
toxic.On
Thursday
,
the
Ministry
of
Electronics
and
Information
Technology
,
the
government
arm
in
India
that
has
been
pressuring
Twitter
to
take
down
material
,
posted
a
response
to
the
companies
’
statement
on
Koo
,
a
competing
service.
“
The
new
rules
are
only
designed
to
prevent
abuse
and
misuse
of
social
media
,
”
Ravi
Shankar
Prasad
,
India
’
s
minister
of
electronics
and
information
technology
,
said
in
the
statement
.
“
Government
welcomes
criticism
including
the
right
to
ask
questions.
”
In
a
separate
statement
on
Thursday
,
the
ministry
criticized
Twitter
for
its
comments
,
calling
them
“
totally
baseless
,
false
and
an
attempt
to
defame
India.
”
It
also
said
protecting
free
speech
in
India
was
not
the
company
’
s
“
prerogative.
”
Last
week
,
the
government
requested
that
social
media
platforms
,
including
Twitter
and
Facebook
,
remove
all
content
related
to
coronavirus
variants
in
India
,
particularly
the
posts
that
said
the
variants
were
spreading
in
other
countries
.
Twitter
confirmed
that
it
had
received
the
request
,
but
hadn
’
t
removed
the
posts
as
of
Thursday
evening
.
Facebook
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment.At
least
one
of
the
variants
first
seen
in
India
,
known
as
B.1.617.2
,
is
now
outpacing
all
other
versions
of
the
virus
in
Britain
,
scientists
in
the
United
Kingdom
have
said
,
and
is
present
in
at
least
48
other
countries
.
The
government
request
has
called
that
assertion
“
completely
false.
”
Free-speech
lawyers
said
the
government
had
no
legal
basis
to
ask
social
media
platforms
to
remove
that
content
,
which
could
apply
to
news
reports
and
important
scientific
discussions
about
the
virus
in
India
,
where
it
continues
to
kill
thousands
of
people
a
day
,
stretching
the
country
’
s
health
care
system
far
beyond
its
limit.
“
The
new
rules
are
like
a
choke
collar
,
”
said
Devdutta
Mukhopadhyay
,
a
lawyer
who
works
on
free-speech
issues
in
India
.
“
The
government
will
tug
at
it
when
it
wants
to.

Sri
Lanka
is
tapping
Japan
.
Nepal
has
asked
Denmark
.
Bangladesh
has
appealed
to
its
diaspora
in
the
United
States.South
Asian
countries
are
looking
to
the
rest
of
the
world
to
jump-start
inoculation
campaigns
that
have
stalled
since
India
halted
vaccine
exports
to
deal
with
its
catastrophic
second
coronavirus
wave
this
spring.The
ad
hoc
approach
shows
how
the
decision
by
India
,
the
world
’
s
biggest
vaccine
manufacturer
,
left
poorer
countries
with
few
options
for
vaccines
as
richer
countries
hoarded
much
of
the
global
supply
.
Even
as
the
United
States
and
other
global
powers
pledge
to
donate
a
billion
doses
to
poor
nations
,
the
World
Health
Organization
says
11
billion
doses
are
needed
to
defeat
the
pandemic.Countries
in
South
Asia
and
elsewhere
—
many
battling
outbreaks
—
continue
to
scramble
for
vaccines
.
Health
officials
say
the
vaccine
pledge
by
the
Group
of
7
industrialized
nations
is
too
vague
to
incorporate
into
real
planning
,
and
does
little
to
address
the
immediate
needs
of
the
millions
of
people
awaiting
doses.India
’
s
neighbors
began
vaccinations
this
year
with
a
combination
of
doses
donated
by
India
and
purchased
from
the
Serum
Institute
of
India
,
which
is
producing
the
vaccine

as
coronavirus

rose
sharply
in
India
in
March
,
Prime
Minister
Narendra
Modi
’
s
government
blocked
exports
,
forcing
Serum
to
renege
on
bilateral
agreements
and
commitments
to
Covax
,
the

program
aimed
at
distributing

to
the

Nepal
,
about
1.4
million
people
age
65
and
older
have
been
awaiting
a
second
shot
after
receiving
a
first
AstraZeneca
dose
in
March
.
Nepal
’
s
government
has
appealed
to
diplomats
in
Britain
,
Denmark
,
South
Korea
and
the
United
States
for
help.
“
Efforts
are
on
,
”
said
Dr.
Taranath
Pokhrel
,
a
director
at
the
Nepalese
Health
Ministry
,
“
but
no
substantive
progress
has
been
achieved
so
far.
”
Of
the
first
25
million
vaccine
doses
pledged
as
donations
by
the
Biden
administration
,
seven
million
are
earmarked
for
Nepal
and
other
countries
in
Asia
,
but
in
Kathmandu
,
the
Nepalese
capital
,
it
’
s
not
clear
when
,
what
kind
or
how
many
will
arrive.Even
after
a
weekslong
nationwide
lockdown
,
nearly
one
in
three
of
Nepal
’
s
coronavirus
tests
has
been
coming
back
positive
.
Less
than
1
percent
of
the
Himalayan
country
’
s
30
million
people
are
fully
vaccinated.Nepal
,
Bangladesh
and
Sri
Lanka
have
all
received
donations
from
China
of
its
Sinopharm
vaccine
.
But
Sri
Lanka
,
like
Nepal
,
is
angling
for
more
AstraZeneca
shots
to
provide
a
second
dose
to
tens
of
thousands
of
people
,
some
of
whom
have
been
waiting
for
nearly
four
months.Sri

,
met
with

to
appeal
for
600,000

and

said
that
the
Japanese
government
was
receptive.Japan
,
which
has
announced
plans
to
donate
doses
across

,
has
“
given
a
bit
of
a

light
”
to
Sri

Gen.
Shavendra

the
head
of

told

government
plans
to
inoculate
the
rest
of
its
population
with
the
donated
Sinopharm

and
Sputnik

shots
it
has
purchased
from
Russia.Bangladesh
,
where
infections
and
deaths
from
a
second
wave
of
the
coronavirus
continue
to
rise
,
is
counting
on
its
U.S.
diaspora
to
raise
pressure
on
the
Biden
administration
for
help
obtaining
more
AstraZeneca
doses
,
said
Shamsul
Haque
,
secretary
of
the
country
’
s
Covid
vaccine
management
committee.
“
We
are
short
roughly
1.5
million
doses
of
AstraZeneca
for
second
shots
,
”
Mr.
Haque
said.China
has
donated
1.1
million
Sinopharm
doses
,
and
Bangladesh
is
negotiating
bulk
buys
of
more
vaccines
from
China
,
and
Sputnik
V
doses
from
Russia
.
Only
about
4.2
million
of
Bangladesh
’
s
168
million
people
are
fully
vaccinated.If
world
leaders
don
’
t
act
now
,
the
end
of
the
Covid
pandemic
may
come
with
a
horrible
form
of
herd
immunity
,
as
more
transmissible
variants
that
are
taking
hold
around
the
world
kill
millions.There
’
s
troubling
new
evidence
that
the
B.1.617.2
variant
,
first
identified
in
India
,
could
be
far
more
transmissible
than
even
the
B.1.1.7
variant
,
first
identified
in
Britain
,
which
contributed
to
some
of
the
deadliest
surges
around
the
world.In
countries
with
widespread
vaccination
,
like
the
United
States
and
Britain
,
we
can
expect
that
Covid
cases
,
hospitalizations
and
deaths
will
continue
to
decline
or
stay
low
,
especially
because
lab
tests
and
real
world
experience
show
that
vaccines
appear
to
defend
recipients
well
against
the
severe
effects
of
both
variants.For
much
of
the
rest
of
the
world
,
though
,
this
even
more
transmissible
new
variant
could
be
catastrophic.The
evidence
is
not
yet
conclusive
because
the
data
is
preliminary
and
figuring
out
if
a
variant
is
more
transmissible
isn
’
t
easy
.
It
could
be
spreading
rapidly
in
an
area
because
of
chance
.
Maybe
it
got
there
before
other
variants
and
found
a
susceptible
population
,
or
got
lucky
and
seeded
a
mega-cluster
.
If
a
variant
is
seen
more
frequently
in
a
country
’
s
genomic
databases
it
could
just
be
because
travelers
,
who
are
often
tested
more
routinely
,
are
bringing
it
in
from
another
country
where
it
is
already
dominant.One
key
measure
that
’
s
been
used
in
previous
outbreaks
to
figure
out
if
a
variant
was
more
transmissible
was
to
look
at
“
secondary
attack
rates
”
in
non-travel
settings
—
how
many
people
who
come
into
close
contact
with
an
infected
person
get
the
virus
themselves
.
The
greater
the
number
of
these
contacts
getting
the
virus
,
on
average
,
the
greater
the
likelihood
that
a
variant
’
s
transmissibility
is
greater.Data
on
secondary
attack
rates
released
on
Saturday
by
a
British
public
health
agency
similar
to
our
own
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
suggests
that
this
variant
first
seen
in
India
may
be
substantially
more
transmissible
among
close
contacts
than
even
the
already
highly
transmissible
B.1.1.7
.
A
report
published
by
the
same
agency
on
Thursday
further
supports
last
week
’
s
findings
.
It
was
just
such
early
data
that
raised
alarms
about
B.1.1.7
,
with
later
information
confirming
those
early
fears.Adam
Kucharski
,
an
epidemiologist
with
the
London
School
of
Hygiene
and
Tropical
Medicine
,
also
told
me
that
the
faster
spread
in
areas
of
Britain
with
higher
levels
of
the
variant
suggests
it
has
higher
transmissibility
.
This
point
seems
to
be
backed
up
by
the
terrible
outbreaks
in
India
and
neighboring
Nepal
,
where
it
is
also
widespread
.
Given
how
limited
genetic
identification
is
in
those
countries
,
the
data
from
Britain
is
particularly
useful
for
assessing
the
risk.A
variant
with
higher
transmissibility
is
a
huge
danger
to
people
without
immunity
either
from
vaccination
or
prior
infection
,
even
if
the
variant
is
no
more
deadly
than
previous
versions
of
the
virus
.
Residents
of
countries
like
Taiwan
and
Vietnam
that
had
almost
completely
kept
out
the
pandemic
,
and
countries
like
India
and
Nepal
that
had
fared
relatively
well
until
recently
,
have
fairly
little
immunity
,
and
are
largely
unvaccinated
.
A
more
transmissible
variant
can
burn
through
such
an
immunologically
naïve
population
very
fast.Increased
transmissibility
is
an
exponential
threat
.
If
a
virus
that
could
previously
infect
three
people
on
average
can
now
infect
four
,
it
looks
like
a
small
increase
.
Yet
if
you
start
with
just
two
infected
people
in
both
scenarios
,
in
total
,
after
10
rounds
of
infection
,
the
more
transmissible
variant
would
cause
2.8
million
cases
,
as
opposed
to
177,000
for
the
less
transmissible
one.Morally
and
practically
,
this
emergency
demands
immediate
action
:
widespread
vaccination
of
those
most
vulnerable
where
the
threat
is
greatest.Waiving
vaccine
patents
is
fine
,
but
unless
it
’
s
tied
to
a
process
that
actually
increases
the
supply
of
vaccines
,
it
’
s
little
more
than
expressing
thoughts
and
prayers
after
a
tragedy
.
Officials
from
all
nations
that
produce
vaccines
need
to
gather
for
an
emergency
meeting
immediately
to
decide
how
to
commandeer
whatever
excess
capacity
they
have
to
produce
more
,
through
whatever
means
necessary
.
Because
of
the
threat
of
increased
transmissibility
,
and
since
the
evidence
at
hand
indicates
that
all
of
the
vaccines
,
even
the
Chinese
and
Russian
versions
,
appear
to
be
highly
effective
against
severe
disease
or
worse
,
the
focus
should
be
on
manufacturing
and
distributing
the
highest
number
of
doses
possible
as
fast
as
possible.If
the
choice
is
between
no
vaccine
and
any
vaccine
,
the
precedence
should
go
to
whatever
can
be
manufactured
fastest
,
regardless
of
patents
,
nation
of
origin
,
or
countries
prioritizing
their
allies
or
wannabe
allies.Vaccine
supplies
need
to
be
diverted
now
to
where
the
crisis
is
the
worst
,
if
necessary
away
from
the
wealthy
countries
that
have
purchased
most
of
the
supply
.
It
is
,
of
course
,
understandable
that
every
nation
wants
to
vaccinate
its
own
first
,
but
a
country
with
high
levels
of
vaccination
,
especially
among
its
more
vulnerable
populations
,
can
hold
things
off
,
especially
if
they
also
had
big
outbreaks
before
.
In
addition
,
excess
stockpiles
can
go
where
they
are
needed
without
even
slowing
down
existing
vaccination
programs.Right
now
,
Covax
,
the
global
alliance
for
vaccine
equity
,
does
not
have
enough
vaccines
to
distribute
,
and
what
supply
it
does
get
is
allocated
according
to
national
population
,
not
the
seriousness
of
outbreaks
.
This
needs
to
change
.
Our
fire
department
needs
more
water
,
and
should
direct
it
to
where
the
fire
is
burning
,
not
to
every
house
on
the
street.The
responses
could
vary
.
The
elderly
and
health
care
workers
could
be
prioritized
wherever
a
crisis
is
worst
.
Dose-sparing
strategies
could
be
applied
—
delaying
boosters
has
been
successful
in
Britain
and
Canada
when
they
faced
surges
.
The
details
can
be
decided
by
the
global
health
authorities.If
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
that
the
world
faces
a
mounting
threat
,
it
’
s
best
to
intervene
as
early
and
aggressively
as
possible
,
because
even
a
few
weeks
of
delay
could
make
a
huge
difference
.
Waiting
for
definitive
evidence
of
transmissibility
could
allow
the
variant
to
rampage
—
besides
,
if
fears
prove
unfounded
then
the
world
would
still
be
better
off
for
being
more
vaccinated
.
And
any
solution
,
even
if
imperfect
,
is
better
than
waiting
for
the
perfect
setup
or
the
most
conclusive
evidence.As
Dr.
Kucharski
told
me
,
it
’
s
now
entirely
possible
that
most
Covid
deaths
could
occur
after
there
are
enough
vaccines
to
protect
those
most
at
risk
globally
.
Britain
had
more
daily
Covid-related
deaths
during
the
surge
involving
B.1.1.7
than
in
the
first
wave
,
when
there
was
less
understanding
of
how
to
treat
the
disease
and
far
fewer
therapeutics
that
later
helped
cut
mortality
rates
.
Even
after
the
vaccination
campaign
began
,
B.1.1.7
kept
spreading
rapidly
among
the
unvaccinated
.
A
similar
pattern
was
observed
in
much
of
Eastern
Europe
as
well.Even
if
it
is
determined
the
transmissibility
of
B.1.617.2
isn
’
t
as
bad
as
feared
,
the
emergency
is
still
there.The
kind
of
catastrophic
outbreak
like
the
one
in
India
can
cause
many
more
needless
deaths
simply
by
overwhelming
our
resources
.
Already
,
there
are
reports
that
countries
ranging
from
Nepal
to
the
Philippines
to
South
Africa
to
Nigeria
may
face
supplemental
oxygen
shortages
of
the
kind
seen
in
India
.
This
pathogen
has
one
fatality
rate
when
oxygen
is
available
as
a
therapy
and
one
when
it
is
not
,
and
it
would
be
an
unspeakable
tragedy
to
suffer
the
latter
in
the
second
year
of
the
pandemic.Like
all
pandemics
,
this
one
will
end
either
with
millions
—
maybe
billions
—
being
infected
or
being
vaccinated
.
This
time
,
world
leaders
have
a
choice
,
but
little
time
to
make
that
choice
before
it
is
made
for
them.KATHMANDU
,
Nepal
—
Ram
Singh
Karki
escaped
the
first
wave
of
India
’
s
pandemic
by
boarding
a
crowded
bus
and
crossing
the
border
home
to
Nepal
.
Months
later
,
as
the
rate
of
new
infections
fell
,
he
returned
to
his
job
at
a
printing
press
in
New
Delhi
,
which
had
sustained
his
family
for
two
decades
and
helped
pay
the
school
fees
of
his
three
children.Then
India
was
swept
by
a
second
wave
,
and
Mr.
Karki
wasn
’
t
as
lucky.He
was
infected
last
month
.
Hospitals
in
New
Delhi
were
overwhelmed
.
When
his
oxygen
level
dropped
,
his
manager
arranged
for
an
ambulance
to
take
him
back
to
the
border
.
He
crossed
into
Nepal
,
carrying
with
him
just
the
clothes
on
his
back
—
and
the
virus.Nepal
is
now
considering
declaring
a
health
emergency
as
the
virus
rampages
virtually
unchecked
across
the
impoverished
nation
of
30
million
people
.
Carried
by
returning
migrant
workers
and
others
,
a
vicious
second
wave
has
stretched
the
country
’
s
medical
system
beyond
its
meager
limits.Nepal
has
recorded
half
a
million
Covid
cases
and
6,000
deaths
,
numbers
that
experts
believe
deeply
undercount
the
toll
.
Testing
remains
limited
.
One
figure
could
indicate
the
true
severity
:
For
weeks
now
,
about
40
percent
of
the
tests
conducted
have
been
positive.A
government
in
disarray
has
compounded
the
trouble
.
K.P
.
Sharma
Oli
,
Nepal
’
s
embattled
prime
minister
,
has
been
pushing
for
an
election
in
November
after
the
country
’
s
Parliament
was
dissolved
this
month
,
an
event
that
could
worsen
the
spread.This
past
week
Hridyesh
Tripathi
,
Nepal
’
s
minister
for
health
and
population
,
said
the
government
was
considering
declaring
a
health
emergency
as
infections
rise.But
such
a
declaration
could
be
caught
up
in
politics
.
The
move
would
allow
officials
to
limit
people
’
s
movements
—
a
level
of
control
that
opposition
groups
worry
could
be
used
to
quell
dissent.In
the
meantime
,
officials
in
Kathmandu
,
the
capital
,
have
urged
people
to
store
food
for
at
least
a
week
and
stay
home.The
impact
is
rippling
beyond
those
infected
.
Remittances
from
migrant
workers
have
slowed
.
Tourism
and
the
economy
have
been
damaged.
“
Millions
of
people
continue
to
feel
the
increasing
pressure
not
just
with
the
direct
health
impact
of
Covid-19
,
but
also
with
food
,
jobs
,
medical
bills
,
kids
out
of
school
,
payback
loans
,
mental
pressure
,
and
much
more
,
”
said
Ayshanie
Medagangoda
Labe
,
the
resident
representative
of
the
United
Nations
Development
Program
in
Nepal.Nepal
’
s
close
relationship
with
India
helped
make
it
vulnerable
.
India
has
long
been
its
most
important
trade
and
transit
partner
.
The
two
nations
share
a
deep
cultural
bond
across
a
porous
1,100-mile
border
.
Nepal
’
s
devastation
mirrors
that
of
its
big
neighbor
—
from
patients
spilling
out
into
hospital
corridors
and
onto
lawns
,
to
long
lines
at
oxygen
refilling
facilities
,
to
a
government
unprepared
for
crisis.Officials
say
laborers
like
Mr.
Karki
who
were
forced
to
come
home
by
the
second
wave
brought
the
virus
with
them
.
Villages
along
the
border
are
some
of
the
worst
hit
.
Nepal
’
s
health
ministry
said
about
97
percent
of
the
cases
sent
for
genome
sequencing
show
the
B.1.617.2
variant
found
in
India
,
which
the
World
Health
Organization
has
classified
as
a
“
variant
of
global
concern.
”
Nepal
’
s
leaders
were
unprepared
.
During
India
’
s
first
wave
last
year
,
when
about
one
million
Nepali
migrant
workers
returned
home
,
Nepal
instituted
testing
and
quarantine
measures
at
border
crossings.But
during
this
spring
’
s
second
wave
,
those
measures
were
too
little
too
late
.
By
the
time
Nepal
shut
two-thirds
of
its
border
crossings
in
early
May
,
hundreds
of
thousands
of
laborers
had
made
it
back
,
trickling
into
their
villages
without
proper
testing
or
quarantine
.
Thousands
continue
to
return
daily.The
government
’
s
attention
had
shifted
elsewhere
.
In
February
,
when
the
virus
seemed
to
be
in
retreat
,
Mr.
Oli
held
rallies
of
thousands
of
supporters
in
Kathmandu
and
other
cities
.
Opposition
parties
held
their
own
rallies
.
Last
year
,
Mr.
Oli
said
the
health
of
the
Nepali
people
would
deter
the
disease.The
government
’
s
defenders
say
that
the
pandemic
is
a
global
problem
and
that
officials
are
doing
the
best
they
can
with
few
resources
or
vaccines.Mr
.
Oli
has
called
for
international
aid
,
though
it
won
’
t
be
enough
to
meet
Nepal
’
s
needs
.
China
has
donated
800,000
vaccine
doses
,
20,000
oxygen
cylinders
and
100
ventilators
.
The
United
States
and
Spain
have
sent
planeloads
of
medical
equipment
,
including
oxygen
concentrators
,
antigen
tests
,
face
masks
and
surgical
gloves
.
The
United
States
provided
$
15
million
this
month
to
scale
up
Nepal
’
s
Covid
testing
.
Nepali
migrant
workers
in
Persian
Gulf
nations
have
arranged
for
oxygen
cylinders
to
be
sent
home.But
Nepal
can
’
t
fight
the
pandemic
without
help
from
India
.
Already
,
an
Indian
vaccine
manufacturer
has
told
Nepal
it
can
’
t
deliver
a
promised
one
million
doses.Nepal
is
also
dependent
on
India
for
half
of
its
medical
equipment
needs
,
according
to
the
Chemical
and
Medical
Suppliers
Association
of
Nepal
,
but
the
latter
country
is
keeping
just
about
everything
for
its
own
urgent
domestic
needs
.
Equipment
from
China
,
already
costly
,
has
become
more
difficult
to
obtain
because
of
Chinese
pandemic
restrictions.
“
For
a
month
now
,
India
has
stopped
the
supply
of
medical
equipment
and
medicine
also
,
not
just
vaccines
,
”
said
Suresh
Ghimirey
,
the
association
’
s
president.In
some
provinces
that
experienced
the
return
of
many
migrant
laborers
in
India
,
hospitals
have
run
out
of
beds
.
In
Surkhet
district
,
the
main
provincial
hospital
said
that
it
couldn
’
t
admit
more
patients
.
Small
outlying
villages
are
quietly
mourning
their
dead
.
Testing
has
been
slow.
“
Except
a
few
villagers
,
many
are
unable
to
come
out
and
do
daily
agricultural
work
,
”
said
Jhupa
Ram
Lamsal
,
ward
chief
of
the
village
of
Gauri
,
where
nine
people
died
of
Covid
over
10
days
earlier
this
month
.
“
The
worrying
thing
is
that
even
symptomatic
people
aren
’
t
ready
for
Covid
tests.
”
Mr
.
Lamsal
said
he
had
recently
reached
Gauri
,
which
is
remote
and
lacks
health
facilities
,
along
with
a
team
of
doctors
to
conduct
antigen
tests
.
Locals
turned
down
health
professionals
’
plea
for
Covid
tests
,
he
said
,
arguing
they
would
be
dispirited
if
they
found
out
they
were
positive.
“
The
situation
is
out
of
control
,
”
Mr.
Lamsal
said
.
“
We
are
hopeless
,
helpless.
”
Mr
.
Kakri
,
the
printing

worker
,
hailed
from
a
village
in
the
Bhimdatta
Municipality
,
in
Nepal
’
s
western
corner
.
The
area
of
110,000
people
has
officially
recorded
3,600
infections
,
according
to
the
health
chief
there
,
Narendra
Joshi
.
But
lack
of
measures
at
the
border
means
that
the
data
may
not
fully
measure
the
severity.
“
More
than
38,000
people
have
returned
from
one
of
the
two
border
points
in
the
district
since
the
second
wave
started
in
India
,
”
said
Mr.
Joshi
.
“
It
’
s
hard
to
manage
them.
”
Mr
.
Karki
was
a
high
school
dropout
who
went
to
India
to
work
as
a
laborer
when
he
was
still
a
teenager
,
his
wife
,
Harena
Devi
Karki
,
said
.
On
his
visits
home
twice
a
year
,
he
was
the
life
of
gatherings
—
cracking
jokes
,
making
fun
.
The
$
350
a
month
he
sent
home
covered
his
family
’
s
household
costs
as
well
as
the
private
school
fees
of
their
two
teenage
daughters
and
a
12-year-old
son.Even
when
the
lockdown
last
year
meant
Mr.
Karki
was
stuck
at
home
for
months
with
no
earnings
,
he
insisted
the
children
continue
with
private
school
.
He
would
repay
the
debts
once
the
printing
press
opened
again
.
He
dreamed
of
seeing
his
eldest
daughter
—
“
she
’
s
the
most
talented
”
—
grow
up
to
be
a
doctor.
“
I
couldn
’
t
complete
my
studies
,
”
Ms.
Karki
remembers
her
husband
saying
.
“
Let
me
eat
less
,
but
we
should
send
them
to
a
better
school
for
their
education.
”
When
Ms.
Karki
received
her
husband
at
the
border
around
2:30
a.m.
on
April
29
,
she
said
,
he
was
frail
and
lacked
the
energy
to
even
stand
up
.
He
was
taken
to
a
nearby
hospital
,
where
he
died.
“
‘
Everything
is
OK.
Go
home
,
’
”
her
husband
told
her
,
Ms.
Karki
said
.
“
But
he
never
came
home.

The
Indian
government
is
in
talks
with
Pfizer
to
obtain
50
million
doses
of
the
company
’
s
coronavirus
vaccine
starting
this
summer
,
but
is
still
considering
the
drug
manufacturer
’
s
demand
for
indemnity
from
costs
related
to
severe
side
effects
,
officials
have
said.India
has
not
given
indemnity
,
or
protection
from
legal
liability
,
to
any
manufacturer
of
coronavirus
vaccines
,
but
government
officials
indicated
that
they
were
likely
to
grant
Pfizer
’
s
request
.
The
drug
company
has
obtained
indemnity
in
several
countries
where
its
vaccine
is
already
in
use
,
including
the
United
States.
“
We
are
examining
this
request
,
and
we
will
take
decisions
in
the
larger
interest
of
people
and
on
merits
,
”
Vinod
Paul
,
who
heads
the
Indian
government
’
s
vaccination
program
,
told
reporters
on
Thursday.Officials
said
that
Pfizer
was
prepared
to
supply
India
with
50
million
vaccine
doses
from
July
to
October
and
that
the
company
had
shared
information
related
to
the
drug
’
s
efficacy
with
the
Indian
health
authorities.India
is
struggling
to
inoculate
its
population
as
a
second
wave
of
the
coronavirus
ravages
the
country
,
killing
thousands
a
day
and
overwhelming
medical
facilities
.
More
than
315,000
people
in
India
have
died
of
the
virus
,
the
third-highest
toll
in
the
world
,
after
the
United
States
and
Brazil
,
but
experts
believe
the
official
data
is
a
significant
undercount.Only
3
percent
of
India
’
s
1.3
billion
people
have
been
fully
vaccinated
,
according
to
a
New
York
Times
database
,
and
experts
say
that
vaccines
are
slow
to
reach
rural
India
,
where
the
outbreak
is
growing
.
The
pace
of
vaccinations
nationwide
has
slipped
to
two
million
shots
a
day
from
three
million
a
few
months
ago
,
with
health
centers
saying
that
they
are
running
out
of
doses
and
many
in
the
country
saying
that
they
can
not
find
a
place
to
be
inoculated.Indian
officials
now
say
that
expanding
vaccinations
is
the
only
way
out
of
the
outbreak
,
but
,
unlike
many
other
countries
,
the
government
of
Prime
Minister
Narendra
Modi
declined
to
sign
advance
purchase
agreements
with
vaccine
manufacturers
,
believing
this
year
that
it
had
defeated
the
virus
.
Experts
say
that
as
Indians
lowered
their
guard
,
they
were
left
defenseless
against
coronavirus
variants
that
are
believed
to
be
more
transmissible.India
’
s
large
vaccine
manufacturing
industry
has
failed
to
keep
up
with
demand
,
leaving
the
country
reliant
on
imported
doses
that
are
in
short
supply
globally
.
On
Thursday
,
Indian
officials
said
that
they
would
work
with
Pfizer
to
make
its
doses
available
as
soon
as
possible.Despite
the
vaccine
shortage
,
some
places
are
beginning
to
ease
restrictions
.
India
’
s
capital
,
New
Delhi
,
will
begin
a
phased
end
to
its
monthlong
lockdown
next
week
,
the
chief
minister
of
Delhi
,
Arvind
Kejriwal
,
said.NEW
DELHI
—
The
Indian
capital
,
which
just
weeks
ago
suffered
the
devastating
force
of
the
coronavirus
,
with
tens
of
thousands
of
new
infections
daily
and
funeral
pyres
that
burned
day
and
night
,
is
taking
its
first
steps
back
toward
normalcy.Officials
on
Monday
reopened
manufacturing
and
construction
activity
,
allowing
workers
in
those
industries
to
return
to
their
jobs
after
six
weeks
of
staying
at
home
to
avoid
infection
.
The
move
came
after
a
sharp
drop
in
new
infections
,
at
least
by
the
official
numbers
,
and
as
hospital
wards
emptied
and
the
strain
on
medicine
and
supplies
has
eased.Life
on
the
streets
of
Delhi
is
not
expected
to
return
to
normal
immediately
.
Schools
and
most
businesses
are
still
closed
.
The
Delhi
Metro
system
,
which
reopened
after
last
year
’
s
nationwide
lockdown
,
has
suspended
service
again.But
the
city
government
’
s
easing
of
restrictions
will
allow
people
like
Ram
Niwas
Gupta
and
his
employees
to
begin
returning
to
work
—
and
,
more
broadly
,
to
start
to
repair
India
’
s
ailing
,
pandemic-struck
economy
.
Mr.
Gupta
,
a
construction
company
owner
,
must
replace
the
migrant
workers
who
fled
Delhi
when
a
second
wave
of
the
coronavirus
struck
in
April
,
but
he
was
confident
that
business
would
return
to
normal
soon.
“
Immediately
we
will
not
be
able
to
start
work
,
but
slowly
in
six
to
10
days
we
will
be
able
to
mobilize
labor
and
material
and
start
the
work
,
”
said
Mr.
Gupta
,
who
is
also
the
president
of
the
Builders
Association
of
India
in
Delhi.At
least
one
million
people
in
Delhi
’
s
construction
sector
will
be
able
to
return
to
job
sites.Even
a
small
opening
represents
a
gamble
by
city
officials
.
Just
3
percent
of
India
’
s
1.4
billion
people
are
fully
vaccinated
.
Because
of
limited
health
infrastructure
and
public
reporting
,
the
state
of
the
pandemic
in
rural
areas
—
including
some
just
outside
Delhi
—
is
largely
unknown
.
Experts
are
already
predicting
a
third
wave
while
cautioning
that
the
lull
in
Delhi
may
be
just
a
respite
,
and
not
the
end
of
the
second
wave.Six
weeks
ago
,
the
number
of
new
cases
in
Delhi
was
soaring
,
reaching
a
peak
of
28,395
new
recorded
infections
on
April
20
.
Nearly
one
in
three
coronavirus
tests
came
back
positive
.
Hospitals
,
full
beyond
capacity
,
turned
away
throngs
of
people
seeking
treatment
,
with
some
patients
dying
just
outside
the
gates
.
Cremation
,
the
preferred
last
rite
for
Hindus
,
spilled
over
into
empty
lots
,
with
so
many
bodies
burned
that
Delhi
’
s
skies
turned
an
ash
gray.The
nightmare
in
India
’
s
capital
appears
to
be
over
,
at
least
for
now
,
even
as
cases
rise
elsewhere
in
the
country
.
The
city
reported
648
new
cases
on
Monday
,
and
about
four-fifths
of
the
intensive
care
unit
beds
were
vacant.Officials
in
Delhi
,
and
around
India
,
feel
a
need
to
strike
a
balance
between
pandemic
precautions
and
economic
viability.On
Monday
,
India
released
a
new
set
of
numbers
that
showed
the
country
’
s
economy
grew
by
1.6
percent
for
the
three-month
period
ending
in
March
.
But
economists
say
those
numbers
,
which
reflected
activity
before
the
full
impact
of
the
ferocious
second
wave
,
are
most
likely
unsustainable
in
the
current
quarter
,
which
ends
June
30
.
Economists
broadly
predict
growth
during
the
full
fiscal
year
ending
on
March
31
,
2022
,
but
the
pace
is
uncertain.Experts
point
to
two
main
reasons
:
India
’
s
prolonged
lockdowns
and
its
vaccination
rate
,
which
has
fallen
to
just
over
a
million
doses
a
day
now
from
about
four
million
last
month
because
of
the
country
’
s
limited
vaccine
manufacturing
capacity.Though
the
lockdowns
have
helped
India
slow
the
surge
of
infections
,
economists
say
restrictions
might
need
to
remain
in
place
at
least
until
about
30
percent
of
the
country
’
s
1.4
billion
people
have
received
one
vaccine
shot.
“
We
estimate
that
India
will
reach
the
vaccine
threshold
by
mid-
to
late
August
,
and
,
accordingly
,
expect
restrictions
will
be
extended
into
the
third
quarter
,
”
Priyanka
Kishore
,
the
head
of
India
and
Southeast
Asia
at
Oxford
Economics
,
said
in
a
research
briefing
last
week
.
“
Consequently
,
we
have
lowered
our
2021
growth
forecast.
”
She
added
that
supply
issues
and
vaccine
hesitancy
could
prevent
the
country
from
reaching
the
30
percent
threshold
by
August
,
which
could
result
in
further
economic
decline.One
economist
said
that
the
economic
hit
would
be
even
more
pronounced
in
rural
areas.
“
As
things
stand
now
,
the
scale
,
the
speed
and
the
spread
of
Covid
has
once
again
given
a
push
back
to
the
economy
,
”
said
Dr.
Sunil
Kumar
Sinha
,
the
principal
economist
at
India
Ratings
and
Research
,
a
credit
ratings
agency
.
Dr.
Sinha
added
that
the
country
’
s
negative
growth
estimates
for
the
previous
financial
year
were
the
lowest
ever
recorded.The
lockdown
that
began
easing
on
Monday
was
nowhere
near
as
severe
as
the
nationwide
lockdown
imposed
by
India
’
s
prime
minister
,
Narendra
Modi
,
last
year
,
which
pushed
millions
of
people
out
of
cities
and
into
rural
areas
,
often
on
foot
because
rail
and
other
transportation
had
been
suspended
.
Mr.
Modi
resisted
calls
by
many
epidemiologists
,
including
Dr.
Anthony
Fauci
,
the
director
of
the
U.S.
National
Institute
of
Allergy
and
Infectious
Diseases
,
to
reinstitute
similar
curbs
this
year.But
in
a
nod
to
the
chaos
of
last
year
’
s
lockdown
,
throughout
the
second
wave
,
core
infrastructure
projects
across
the
country
,
which
employ
millions
of
domestic
migrant
workers
,
were
exempted
from
restrictions
.
More
than
15,000
miles
of
Indian
highway
projects
,
along
with
rail
and
city
Metro
improvements
,
continued.Most
private
construction
sites
,
however
,
were
closed
down
,
placing
workers
like
Ashok
Kumar
,
a
36-year-old
carpenter
,
in
extremely
precarious
positions.Mr
.
Kumar
usually
earns
700
rupees
,
about
$
10
,
per
day
,
but
has
sat
at
home
idly
for
the
last
40
days
,
unable
to
pay
rent
to
an
increasingly
impatient
landlord
.
He
hoped
to
be
vaccinated
before
returning
to
close
quarters
with
other
workers
,
but
hasn
’
t
been
able
to
secure
a
dose
at
one
of
the
city
’
s
public
dispensaries
,
which
have
closed
intermittently
because
of
vaccine
shortages.
“
My
first
priority
is
my
stomach
,
”
Mr.
Kumar
said
.
“
If
my
stomach
is
not
filled
I
will
die
even
before
corona.
”
In
a
meeting
with
the
city
’
s
disaster
management
authority
on
Friday
,
Delhi
’
s
chief
minister
,
Arvind
Kejriwal
,
said
the
lockdown
would
be
eased
in
phases
according
to
economic
need.
“
Our
priority
will
be
the
weakest
economic
sections
,
so
we
will
start
with
laborers
,
particularly
migrant
laborers
,
”
many
of
whom
work
in
construction
and
manufacturing
,
Mr.
Kejriwal
said.Millions
of
people
in
India
are
already
in
danger
of
sliding
out
of
the
middle
class
and
into
poverty
.
The
country
’
s
economy
was
fraying
well
before
the
pandemic
because
of
deep
structural
problems
and
the
sometimes
impetuous
policy
decisions
of
Mr.
Modi.Epidemiologists
in
India
generally
approved
of
the
Delhi
government
’
s
approach
to
lifting
its
lockdown
,
but
cautioned
that
the
low
infection
numbers
may
represent
a
reprieve
from
—
and
not
the
end
of
—
the
capital
’
s
terrifying
second
wave.
“
It
’
s
not
a
decision
that
can
be
questioned
on
the
merit
,
but
obviously
they
have
to
take
the
maximum
care
,
”
said
Dr.
K.
Srinath
Reddy
,
president
of
the
Public
Health
Foundation
of
India.India
averaged
190,392
reported
cases
per
day
in
the
last
week
,
a
drop
of
more
than
50
percent
from
the
peak
,
on
May
9
.
The
death
toll
also
fell
,
though
less
precipitously
,
to
3,709
on
Sunday
.
The
overall
toll
of
325,972
is
widely
considered
to
be
a
vast
undercount.As
cases
have
fallen
in
Delhi
,
people
have
cautiously
left
their
homes
for
evening
strolls
after
the
daytime
summer
heat
has
abated
,
or
to
pick
up
groceries
from
the
normally
bustling
but
now
quiet
neighborhood
markets.Elsewhere
in
India
,
the
pandemic
is
far
from
over
.
Cases
are
rising
in
remote
rural
areas
that
have
scant
health
infrastructure.The
state
of
Haryana
,
which
borders
Delhi
and
is
home
to
the
industrial
hub
of
Gurugram
,
extended
its
tight
lockdown
by
at
least
another
week
.
And
in
southern
Indian
states
where
the
daily
case
numbers
remain
high
,
official
orders
allowing
manufacturing
to
resume
have
been
met
by
resistance
from
workers.
“
It
is
a
question
of
life
versus
livelihood
,
”
said
M.
Moorthy
,
general
secretary
of
the
workers
union
at
the
Renault
Nissan
auto
plant
in
Chennai.If
you
haven
’
t
yet
mastered
the
name
of
the
latest
coronavirus
variant
to
set
nations
on
edge
—
B.1.617.2
,
as
evolutionary
biologists
call
it
—
then
fear
not
:
The
World
Health
Organization
has
proposed
a
solution.The
group
said
on
Monday
that
it
had
devised
a
less
technical
,
and
more
easily
pronounceable
,
system
for
naming
variants
—
the
mutated
versions
of
the
virus
that
have
driven
new
surges
of
infections
around
the
world.Variants
will
be
assigned
letters
of
the
Greek
alphabet
in
the
order
in
which
they
are
designated
potential
threats
by
the
W.H.O.B.1.617.2
,
for
example
,
which
has
contributed
to
a
deadly
surge
in
India
,
has
been
named
Delta
under
the
new
system
.
That
variant
may
spread
even
more
quickly
than
B.1.1.7
,
the
variant
discovered
in
Britain
that
has
contributed
to
devastating
waves
of
cases
globally
.
(
B.1.1.7
’
s
new
name
is
Alpha
.
)
Scientists
will
keep
assigning
long
strings
of
letters
and
numbers
to
new
variants
for
their
own
purposes
,
but
they
hope
that
Greek
letters
will
roll
off
the
tongues
of
nonscientists
more
easily.There
is
also
a
deeper
motivation
:
The
letters-and-numbers
system
was
so
complicated
that
many
people
were
referring
to
variants
by
the
places
they
were
discovered
instead
(
“
the
Indian
variant
”
for
B.1.617.2
,
for
example
)
.
Scientists
worry
that
those
informal
nicknames
can
be
both
inaccurate
and
stigmatizing
,
punishing
countries
for
investing
in
the
genome
sequencing
necessary
to
sound
an
alarm
about
new
mutations
that
may
well
have
emerged
somewhere
else.Whether
the
Greek
letters
will
stick
is
another
matter
.
It
has
been
months
since
experts
convened
by
the
W.H.O
.
began
discussing
the
issue
,
allowing
labels
like
“
the
British
variant
”
and
“
the
South
African
variant
”
to
proliferate
in
the
news
media.The
experts
said
they
had
considered
a
number
of
alternatives
,
like
taking
syllables
from
existing
words
to
make
new
words
.
But
too
many
of
those
syllable
combinations
were
already
recognizable
names
of
places
or
businesses
,
they
said.And
as
it
happens
,
the
Greek
letters
had
just
been
freed
up
from
another
task
:
The
World
Meteorological
Organization
said
in
March
that
it
would
no
longer
use
them
to
name
hurricanes
.
SAN
FRANCISCO
—
When
India
’
s
government
ordered
Facebook
and
other
tech
companies
to
take
down
posts
critical
of
its
handling
of
the
coronavirus
pandemic
in
April
,
the
social
network
complied
on
some
posts.But
once
it
did
,
its
employees
flocked
to
online
chat
rooms
to
ask
why
Facebook
had
helped
Prime
Minister
Narendra
Modi
of
India
stifle
dissent
.
In
one
internal
post
,
which
was
reviewed
by
The
New
York
Times
,
an
employee
with
family
in
India
accused
Facebook
of
“
being
afraid
”
that
Mr.
Modi
would
ban
the
company
from
doing
business
in
the
country
.
“
We
can
’
t
act
or
make
decisions
out
of
fear
,
”
he
wrote.Weeks
later
,
when
clashes
broke
out
in
Israel
between
Israelis
and
Palestinians
,
Facebook
removed
posts
from
prominent
Palestinian
activists
and
briefly
banned
hashtags
related
to
the
violence
.
Facebook
employees
again
took
to
the
message
boards
to
ask
why
their
company
now
appeared
to
be
censoring
pro-Palestinian
content.
“
It
just
feels
like
,
once
again
,
we
are
erring
on
the
side
of
a
populist
government
and
making
decisions
due
to
politics
,
not
policies
,
”
one
worker
wrote
in
an
internal
message
that
was
reviewed
by
The
Times.Discontent
at
Facebook
has
surged
over
its
recent
handling
of
international
affairs
,
according
to
interviews
with
more
than
half
a
dozen
current
and
former
employees
.
For
weeks
,
they
said
,
employees
have
complained
about
the
company
’
s
responses
in
India
and
Israel
.
The
workers
have
grilled
top
executives
at
meetings
about
the
situations
and
,
in
one
case
,
formed
a
group
to
internally
report
Palestinian
content
that
they
believe
Facebook
had
wrongly
removed
.
This
week
,
more
than
200
employees
also
signed
an
open
letter
calling
for
a
third-party
audit
of
Facebook
’
s
treatment
of
Arab
and
Muslim
posts
,
according
to
a
person
who
saw
the
letter.The
actions
are
another
sign
of
internal
unrest
at
Facebook
as
employee
criticism
broadens
beyond
domestic
issues
.
For
the
past
few
years
,
workers
largely
challenged
Mark
Zuckerberg
,
Facebook
’
s
chief
executive
,
on
his
handling
of
inflammatory
posts
from
former
President
Donald
J.
Trump
.
But
since
Mr.
Trump
left
office
in
January
,
attention
has
shifted
to
Facebook
’
s
global
policies
and
what
employees
said
was
the
company
’
s
acquiescence
to
governments
so
that
it
could
continue
profiting
in
those
countries.
“
There
’
s
a
feeling
among
people
at
Facebook
that
this
is
a
systematic
approach
,
one
which
favors
strong
government
leaders
over
the
principles
of
doing
what
is
right
and
correct
,
”
said
Ashraf
Zeitoon
,
Facebook
’
s
former
head
of
policy
for
the
Middle
East
and
North
Africa
region
,
who
left
in
2017.Facebook
is
increasingly
caught
in
a
vise
.
In
India
,
Russia
and
elsewhere
,
governments
are
pressuring
it
to
remove
content
as
they
try
to
corral
the
platform
’
s
power
over
online
speech
.
But
when
Facebook
complies
with
the
takedown
orders
,
it
has
upset
its
own
employees
,
who
say
the
social
network
has
helped
authoritarian
leaders
and
repressive
regimes
quash
activists
and
silence
marginalized
communities.The
result
has
played
out
in
a
kind
of
internal
culture
clash
,
with
a
growing
movement
of
dissenting
rank-and-file
workers
versus
its
global
public
policy
team
,
which
deals
directly
with
governments
,
said
the
current
and
former
employees
.
Many
workers
have
argued
that
policy
team
members
have
been
too
willing
to
accede
to
governments
,
while
policy
team
members
said
their
colleagues
did
not
appreciate
the
delicate
dance
of
international
relations.Dani
Lever
,
a
Facebook
spokeswoman
,
denied
that
the
company
had
made
decisions
to
appease
governments.
“
Everyone
at
Facebook
shares
the
same
goal
,
which
is
to
give
a
voice
to
as
many
people
around
the
world
as
possible
,
and
we
push
back
on
overreaching
government
requests
wherever
we
can
,
”
she
said
.
She
added
that
Facebook
removed
content
only
after
it
was
reviewed
according
to
the
company
’
s
policies
,
local
laws
and
international
human
rights
standards.Of
the
employee
discontent
,
Ms
.
Lever
said
,
“
Just
as
people
off
of
the
platform
are
debating
these
important
real-world
issues
,
people
who
work
at
Facebook
are
,
too.
”
BuzzFeed
News
and
the
Financial
Times
earlier
reported
on
some
of
the
employee
dissatisfaction
at
Facebook
over
Israeli
and
Palestinian
content.A
divide
between
Facebook
’
s
employees
and
the
global
policy
team
,
which
is
composed
of
roughly
1,000
employees
,
has
existed
for
years
,
current
and
former
workers
said
.
The
policy
team
reports
to
Sheryl
Sandberg
,
the
chief
operating
officer.Many
employees
subscribe
to
the
idea
that
Facebook
should
stand
up
to
what
they
see
as
dictatorial
governments
.
But
the
policy
team
,
which
operates
in
dozens
of
countries
,
often
has
to
weigh
the
likelihood
that
a
government
will
shut
off
the
social
networking
service
if
the
company
does
not
cooperate
with
takedown
orders
,
they
said
.
Sometimes
allowing
some
speech
is
better
than
none
at
all
,
they
have
said.Facebook
has
faced
many
tricky
international
situations
over
the
years
,
including
in
Russia
,
Vietnam
and
Myanmar
,
where
it
has
had
to
consider
whether
it
would
be
shut
down
if
it
did
not
work
with
governments
.
That
has
led
to
the
employee
dissent
,
which
has
begun
spilling
into
public
view.That
became
evident
with
India
.
In
April
,
as
Covid-19
cases
soared
in
the
country
,
Mr.
Modi
’
s
government
called
for
roughly
100
social
media
posts
on
Facebook
,
Instagram
and
Twitter
to
be
pulled
down
.
Many
of
the
posts
included
critiques
of
the
government
from
opposition
politicians
and
calls
for
Mr.
Modi
’
s
resignation.Facebook
removed
some
of
the
posts
and
briefly
blocked
a
hashtag
,
#
ResignModi
.
The
company
later
said
the
hashtag
had
been
banned
by
mistake
and
was
not
part
of
a
government
request.But
internally
,
the
damage
was
done
.
In
online
chat
rooms
dedicated
to
human
rights
issues
and
global
policy
,
employees
described
how
disappointed
they
were
with
Facebook
’
s
actions
.
Some
shared
stories
of
family
members
in
India
who
were
worried
they
were
being
censored.Last
month
,
when
violence
broke
out
between
Israelis
and
Palestinians
,
reports
surfaced
that
Facebook
had
erased
content
from
Palestinian
activists
.
Facebook
’
s
Instagram
app
also
briefly
banned
the
#
AlAqsa
hashtag
,
a
reference
to
Al
Aqsa
Mosque
,
one
of
Islam
’
s
holiest
sites
.
Facebook
later
explained
that
it
had
confused
the
#
AlAqsa
hashtag
with
a
Palestinian
militant
group
called
Al
Aqsa
Martyrs
Brigade.Employees
bristled
.
“
We
are
responding
to
people
’
s
protests
about
censoring
with
more
censoring
?
”
one
wrote
in
an
internal
message
,
which
was
reviewed
by
The
Times
.
Other
employees
wrote
that
Facebook
’
s
Israel
office
was
headed
by
Jordana
Cutler
,
who
previously
worked
for
Prime
Minister
Benjamin
Netanyahu
.
The
employees
said
Ms.
Cutler
,
who
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
,
was
pushing
an
agenda
favorable
to
Mr.
Netanyahu
’
s
government
by
taking
down
anti-Israeli
content
from
Facebook.
“
The
role
of
the
public
policy
team
for
Israel
,
like
the
one
for
Jordan
and
Palestine
,
as
well
as
others
around
the
world
,
is
to
help
make
sure
local
governments
,
regulators
and
our
community
understand
Facebook
’
s
policies
,
”
said
Ms
.
Lever
,
the
Facebook
spokeswoman
.
“
While
these
teams
have
local
knowledge
and
understanding
,
their
only
charge
is
to
serve
as
representatives
for
Facebook.
”
Mr
.
Zeitoon
,
the
former
Facebook
executive
,
cast
a
wider
net
.
“
There
is
a
feeling
there
is
a
significant
tilt
within
Facebook
’
s
management
,
a
systemic
approach
that
does
not
benefit
Palestinians
,
”
he
said
.
“
People
are
mad
—
they
are
challenging
their
bosses
.
They
see
this
as
emblematic
of
so
many
problems
at
Facebook.
”
The
frustrations
were
vocalized
on
May
13
at
an
employee
meeting
that
was
held
virtually
.
At
the
session
,
one
worker
asked
Nick
Clegg
,
who
leads
public
affairs
,
to
explain
the
company
’
s
role
in
removing
content
tied
to
the
Israeli-Palestinian
conflict
,
according
to
attendees
.
The
employee
called
the
situation
in
Israel
“
fraught
”
and
asked
how
Facebook
was
going
“
to
get
it
right
”
with
content
moderation.Mr
.
Clegg
ran
through
a
list
of
policy
rules
and
plans
going
forward
,
and
assured
staff
that
moderation
would
be
treated
with
fairness
and
responsibility
,
two
people
familiar
with
the
meeting
said
.
The
discussion
was
cordial
,
one
of
the
people
said
,
and
comments
in
the
chat
box
beside
Mr.
Clegg
’
s
response
were
largely
positive.But
some
employees
were
dissatisfied
,
the
people
said
.
As
Mr.
Clegg
spoke
,
they
broke
off
into
private
chats
and
workplace
groups
,
known
as
Tribes
,
to
discuss
what
to
do.Dozens
of
employees
later
formed
a
group
to
flag
the
Palestinian
content
that
they
said
had
been
suppressed
to
internal
content
moderation
teams
,
said
two
employees
.
The
goal
was
to
have
the
posts
reinstated
online
,
they
said.Members
of
Facebook
’
s
policy
team
have
tried
calming
the
tensions
.
In
an
internal
memo
in
mid-May
,
which
was
reviewed
by
The
Times
,
two
policy
team
members
wrote
to
other
employees
that
they
hoped
“
that
Facebook
’
s
internal
community
will
resist
succumbing
to
the
division
and
demonization
of
the
other
side
that
is
so
brutally
playing
itself
out
offline
and
online.
”
One
of
them
was
Muslim
,
and
the
other
was
Jewish
,
they
said.
“
We
don
’
t
always
agree
,
”
they
wrote
.
“
However
,
we
do
some
of
our
best
work
when
we
assume
good
intent
and
recognize
that
we
are
on
the
same
side
trying
to
serve
our
community
in
the
best
possible
way.

Milloni
Doshi
,
a
25-year-old
student
from
India
who
is
supposed
to
start
her
master
’
s
degree
this
fall
at
Columbia
University
’
s
School
of
International
and
Public
Affairs
,
has
a
problem.Although
Ms.
Doshi
has
been
vaccinated
against
the
coronavirus
,
she
received
two
doses
of
Covaxin
,
which
is
made
by
an
Indian
manufacturer
and
is
not
currently
approved
by
the
World
Health
Organization
,
as
required
by
the
university.Columbia
has
told
her
she
will
need
to
be
revaccinated
with
a
different
vaccine
once
she
arrives
on
campus
,
but
no
one
can
say
for
sure
if
it
is
safe
to
do
so.
“
I
am
just
concerned
about
taking
two
different
vaccines
,
”
she
wrote
via
a
messaging
app
.
“
They
said
the
application
process
would
be
the
toughest
part
of
the
cycle
,
but
it
’
s
really
been
all
of
this
that
has
been
uncertain
and
anxiety-inducing.
”
Since
March
,
more
than
400
colleges
and
universities
in
the
United
States
have
announced
vaccine
mandates
,
requiring
students
to
be
immunized
against
the
coronavirus
.
But
the
rules
have
been
designed
primarily
with
domestic
students
in
mind
,
leaving
international
students
scrambling
—
particularly
those
in
India
and
Russia.Neither
Covaxin
nor
the
Sputnik
V
vaccine
,
which
is
manufactured
in
Russia
,
has
been
approved
by
the
W.H.O
.
American
students
,
however
,
have
access
to
the
Pfizer-BioNTech
,
Moderna
and
Johnson
&
Johnson
vaccines
,
three
of
the
eight
authorized
by
the
health
agency
,
according
to
a
W.H.O
.
spokesman.The
disparity
could
hinder
colleges
that
have
made
it
a
major
priority
to
retain
international
students
,
who
brought
in
close
to
$
39
billion
in
tuition
dollars
in
the
year
before
the
pandemic
,
according
to
one
analysis.
“
Universities
want
to
enroll
international
students
because
they
add
diversity
to
the
campus
community
—
and
they
bring
money
,
”
said
Terry
W.
Hartle
,
senior
vice
president
at
the
American
Council
on
Education
.
“
It
’
s
why
this
has
been
a
subject
of
intense
discussion.
”
The
situation
is
particularly
challenging
for
students
in
India
,
which
sends
approximately
200,000
international
students
to
American
colleges
every
year
,
the
second
most
after
China
.
The
subcontinent
is
emerging
from
the
grips
of
one
of
the
most
severe
waves
of
the
pandemic
,
when
burial
grounds
were
running
out
of
space
and
funeral
pyres
were
nearly
constantly
burning
.
Vaccine
shortages
are
so
acute
that
only
3
percent
of
the
population
is
fully
immunized
,
and
getting
an
appointment
is
a
taxing
affair.In
some
parts
of
India
,
students
planning
on
attending
American
universities
have
turned
to
the
black
market
,
paying
hundreds
of
dollars
to
be
vaccinated
.
Others
have
hired
people
to
spend
up
to
12
hours
online
trying
to
line
up
a
vaccination
slot.It
is
hard
enough
just
to
get
an
appointment
,
but
even
more
so
to
secure
one
for
a
vaccine
that
will
be
accepted
by
American
campuses.
“
Every

,
we
get
10
to
15

How
does
this

who
dropped
out
of
his
M.B.A.
program
at
New

University
last
year
to
run
the
North
American
Association
of
Indian
Students
,
which
is
working
to
help
fellow
students.Among
the
questions
flooding
Mr.
Kaushik
’
s
inbox
:
What
happens
if
I
can
not
get
my
vaccine
in
time
?
Will
I
still
be
allowed
to
matriculate
in
the
fall
?
What
should
I
do
if
the
vaccine
I
can
get
locally
is
not
approved
by
my
college
?
At
Indiana
University
,
which
announced
its
vaccine
requirement
less
than
two
weeks
ago
,
administrators
are
working
overtime
to
answer
the
roughly
200
phone
calls
and
300
emails
that
are
pouring
in
every
day
from
the
university
’
s
roughly
6,000
students
overseas
,
said
its
vice
president
for
international
affairs
,
Hannah
Buxbaum.
“
Ringing
off
the
hook
doesn
’
t
begin
to
describe
,
”
said
Ms.
Buxbaum
of
the
volume
of
calls
from
overseas
students
who
are
trying
to
navigate
the
vaccine
bureaucracy
in
their
home
countries
,
as
well
as
a
host
of
other
virus-related
problems
,
from
flight
bans
to
shuttered
consulates.
“
There
is
no
question
that
there
is
anxiety
and
concern
among
our
international
students
,
”
she
said.The
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
has
tried
to
provide
guidance
.
The
agency
considers
people
fully
vaccinated
several
weeks
after
they
have
received
the
requisite
doses
of
any
of
the
vaccines
authorized
by
the
W.H.O.
,
said
a
spokeswoman
,
Kristen
Nordlund.Besides
the
three
vaccines
currently
available
in
the
United
States
under
emergency
authorization
by
the
F.D.A.
,
the
world
body
has
,
according
to
its
website
,
also
approved
three
versions
of
the
AstraZeneca
vaccine
,
including
one
made
in
England
and
one
made
in
India
;
the
Sinopharm
vaccine
,
which
is
manufactured
in
China
;
and
,
as
of
this
week
,
the
Sinovac
vaccine
,
also
made
in
China.Many
universities
appear
to
be
following
these
guidelines
:
“
If
a
student
has
had
a
W.H.O.-approved
vaccine
,
”
said
Clayton
S.
Rose
,
the
president
of
Bowdoin
College
,
“
then
the
student
will
be
considered
to
be
vaccinated.
”
At
Columbia
,
where
one-third
of
the
student
body
is
from
overseas
,
international
students
will
be
asked
to
present
either
their
W.H.O
.
booklet
or
a
letter
from
a
physician
confirming
they
have
received
the
requisite
doses
of
one
of
the
vaccines
vetted
by
the
world
body
,
said
Donna
Lynne
,
the
chief
operating
officer
of
the
university
’
s
medical
center
,
who
heads
the
campus
’
s
Covid-19
response.But
that
leaves
two
categories
of
students
that
will
face
a
more
complicated
—
and
potentially
problematic
—
process.There
are
those
who
will
not
succeed
in
securing
a
vaccine
before
the
start
of
the
fall
semester
.
Bowdoin
and
many
other
universities
say
they
plan
to
have
clinics
on
campus
that
will
offer
one
of
the
three
F.D.A.-authorized
vaccines.The
trick
is
that
two
of
those
—
Pfizer
and
Moderna
—
require
the
first
and
second
dose
to
be
spaced
three
weeks
apart
;
because
someone
is
only
considered
fully
vaccinated
two
weeks
after
the
last
dose
,
the
process
lasts
a
minimum
of
five
weeks
.
During
that
time
,
will
students
be
required
to
quarantine
while
the
rest
of
campus
goes
back
to
normal
?
Will
they
need
to
undergo
routine
testing
?
Campuses
are
proposing
different
measures
,
with
some
saying
that
those
students
will
need
to
self-isolate
in
their
dorm
and
attend
classes
remotely
.
Others
are
saying
the
students
will
be
expected
to
wear
a
mask
and
undergo
testing.The
more
complicated
scenario
is
if
students
received
a
vaccine
that
has
not
been
approved
by
the
W.H.O.
,
like
Sputnik
or
Covaxin
.
Many
colleges
are
proposing
that
those
student
will
need
to
be
revaccinated
,
which
presents
both
medical
and
logistical
conundrums.No
data
exists
on
whether
combining
vaccines
from
different
companies
is
safe.
“
Since
Covid-19
vaccines
are
not
interchangeable
,
the
safety
and
effectiveness
of
receiving
two
different
Covid-19
vaccines
have
not
been
studied
,
”
Ms.
Nordlund
,
the
C.D.C
.
spokeswoman
,
wrote
in
an
email.She
added
that
the
C.D.C
.
was
recommending
that
people
who
were
vaccinated
outside
the
United
States
with
a
vaccine
that
was
not
authorized
by
the
W.H.O
.
should
wait
a
minimum
of
28
days
before
taking
the
first
dose
of
one
of
the
F.D.A.-sanctioned
vaccines.Many
universities
were
vague
on
how
they
plan
to
deal
with
the
logistical
complexity
of
spacing
out
these
unrelated
vaccines
,
beyond
saying
that
they
planned
to
accommodate
students
undergoing
this
process.While
much
remains
in
flux
,
at
least
one
major
university
system
is
planning
on
deviating
from
the
C.D.C
.
guidelines.California
State
,
the
largest
public
university
system
in
the
country
with
23
campuses
enrolling
nearly
a
half-million
students
,
plans
to
accept
any
vaccine
a
student
received
if
it
was
authorized
by
the
regulatory
agency
in
their
country
of
origin
,
said
Chancellor
Joseph
I.
Castro.
“
They
will
be
able
to
satisfy
the
requirement
,
”
he
said
,
“
as
long
as
the
vaccine
they
receive
is
approved
by
something
similar
to
an
entity
like
the
F.D.A.
”
Facing
mounting
pressure
from
confused
and
anxious
students
,
at
least
six
regional
governments
in
India
have
announced
emergency
clinics
in
the
past
week
to
vaccinate
students
heading
to
American
universities.One
of
them
is
in
Maharashtra
,
the
state
that
includes
Mumbai
and
is
where
Ms.
Doshi
lives
,
although
the
move
came
too
late
for
her
since
she
is
already
vaccinated
with
an
injection
Columbia
does
not
accept
.
Instead
of
concentrating
on
her
future
course
of
study
,
she
is
fretting
over
whether
the
vaccine
she
will
need
to
get
upon
arriving
at
Columbia
will
cause
an
adverse
reaction.
“
Truthfully
,
it
was
easier
to
get
admitted
than
to
handle
the
post-admissions
process
,
”
she
said.NEW
DELHI
—
India
is
the
world
’
s
leading
producer
of
vaccines
,
but
over
the
past
week
it
has
also
been
the
global
leader
in
Covid-19
deaths
,
and
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
the
country
can
vaccinate
itself
out
of
the
crisis.The
answer
to
that
question
is
a
matter
of
urgent
interest
in
India
,
where
a
second
wave
of
infection
has
left
a
tableau
of
death
and
despair
,
but
it
may
also
have
big
implications
for
other
countries
battling
the
pandemic.India
is
a
critical
supplier
in
the
global
effort
to
vaccinate
people
against
the
coronavirus
,
and
its
struggles
to
roll
out
enough
vaccine
for
its
own
1.4
billion
people
are
being
closely
watched
abroad.In
Africa
,
especially
,
ripples
from
the
Indian
crisis
are
already
being
felt.Health
officials
on
the
continent
who
had
been
counting
on
vaccine
shipments
from
India
learned
just
weeks
ago
that
they
may
not
be
arriving
when
expected
.
India
’
s
prime
minister
,
Narendra
Modi
,
suspended
exports
of
nearly
all
2.4
million
doses
of
the
AstraZeneca
vaccine
produced
daily
by
its
top
vaccine
company
,
the
Serum
Institute
of
India.Now
,
they
will
be
used
in
India
instead.But
even
with
that
shift
,
as
well
as
a
scramble
by
India
’
s
pharmaceutical
industry
to
ramp
up
production
—
including
an
agreement
to
make
the
Sputnik
vaccine
developed
by
Russia
—
the
effort
to
get
as
many
Indians
vaccinated
as
possible
has
been
terribly
outmatched
by
the
speed
of
the
virus
ravaging
the
country.
“
You
can
’
t
vaccinate
your
way
out
of
a
surge
,
”
said
Dr.
Celine
Gounder
,
an
infectious
disease
expert
who
is
a
professor
at
New
York
University
Grossman
School
of
Medicine.Even
if
India
could
somehow
solve
its
vaccine
supply
problem
quickly
,
Dr.
Gounder
and
others
said
,
it
might
not
help
,
at
least
,
not
in
the
short
term
.
Vaccines
take
two
weeks
for
the
first
dose
to
have
an
effect
,
and
require
an
interval
of
about
four
weeks
between
the
first
and
second
dose.The
median
incubation
period
for
the
virus
,
by
contrast
,
is
four
to
five
days
—
meaning
vaccinations
won
’
t
necessarily
avert
infections.India
’
s
health
ministry
on
Thursday
reported
more
than
375,000
cases
and
more
than
3,600
new
deaths
.
With
the
death
toll
already
put
at
more
than
204,000
,
hospitals
warned
of
critical
shortages
of
ventilator
beds
,
medical
oxygen
,
medicines
and
other
lifesaving
supplies.
“
The
ferocity
of
the
second
wave
did
take
everyone
by
surprise
,
”
K.
Vijay
Raghavan
,
the
principal
scientific
adviser
to
the
government
,
said
in
an
interview
published
Thursday
in
the
Indian
Express
newspaper
.
“
While
we
were
all
aware
of
second
waves
in
other
countries
,
we
had
vaccines
at
hand
,
and
no
indications
from
modeling
exercises
suggested
the
scale
of
the
surge.
”
A
New
York
Times
database
of
vaccination
progress
showed
that
as
of
Thursday
,
about
26
million
people
—
1.8
percent
of
India
’
s
population
—
had
been
fully
vaccinated
.
That
is
a
better
rate
than
some
mostly
poor
countries
where
practically
no
one
has
been
vaccinated
,
but
it
is
still
among
the
world
’
s
lowest.In
the
United
States
,
by
contrast
,
where
the
government
has
spent
billions
of
dollars
to
secure
vaccines
,
the
figure
is
30
percent
.
And
even
in
Brazil
,
where
the
virus
has
caused
an
especially
acute
health
and
hunger
crisis
,
5.9
percent
of
the
population
has
been
fully
vaccinated.Mr
.
Modi
’
s
goal
of
vaccinating
300
million
people
by
summer
is
looking
increasingly
unlikely.Dr
.
Peter
J.
Hotez
,
a
molecular
virology
professor
at
Baylor
College
of
Medicine
in
Houston
,
said
one
of
India
’
s
basic
problems
is
simply
not
having
the
supply
of
vaccine
it
needs
.
“
They
’
ve
never
been
scaled
before
to
a
level
like
this
,
”
he
said.The
Serum
Institute
and
other
vaccine
manufacturers
in
India
must
now
produce
hundreds
of
millions
of
doses
,
he
said.How
long
might
it
take
for
India
’
s
vaccine
makers
to
ramp
up
production
?
“
You
’
re
talking
weeks
,
if
not
longer
”
said
Dr.
Gounder
,
the
infectious

expert
,
who
is
the
host
of
two
podcasts
,
“
Epidemic
”
and
“
American
Diagnosis.
”
In
New
Delhi
,
it
was
clear
that
frustration
and
delays
among
vaccine
centers
were
intensifying.Dr
.
Aqsa
Shaikh
,
who
runs
one
of
those
centers
,
said
she
had
emailed
the
Serum
Institute
this
week
asking
for
doses
and
received
a
stunning
response
:
The
company
is
so
overwhelmed
with
demand
it
could
take
five
or
six
months
for
the
center
to
get
the
3,000
doses
per
month
it
requested.
“
When
I
read
that
email
,
images
of
mass
burials
appeared
in
front
of
my
eyes
,
”
Dr.
Shaikh
said
.
“
We
may
have
to
shut
down
the
center
now
if
the
government
doesn
’
t
chip
in.
”
On
Wednesday
,
the
United
States
government
authorized
families
of
diplomats
to
leave
India
and
advised
other
Americans
there
to
leave
“
as
soon
as
it
is
safe
to
do
so.
”
As
grim
as
India
’
s
coronavirus
numbers
are
—
and
experts
warn
that
its
reported
death
toll
could
be
a
significant
undercount
—
its
vaccination
program
was
supposed
to
be
a
bright
spot.Before
the
pandemic
,
India
ran
the
world
’
s
largest
immunization
program
,
delivering
routine
vaccinations
to
55
million
people
a
year
.
After
the
coronavirus
bean
spreading
,
the
Serum
Institute
aimed
to
become
the
vaccine
manufacturer
for
the
world
,
pumping
out
tens
of
millions
of
AstraZeneca
doses
at
its
factories
in
the
western
city
of
Pune.But
after
an
initial
fast
rollout
,
averaging
some
three
million
injections
a
day
,
India
’
s
vaccination
drive
slowed
.
On
Thursday
,
the
Health
Ministry
said
that
it
had
administered
fewer
than
2.2
million
doses
in
the
previous
24
hours.Despite
cash
infusions
from
Mr.
Modi
’
s
government
,
India
’
s
major
vaccine
companies
are
struggling
to
increase
production.The
Serum
Institute
is
producing
about
60
million
doses
a
month
,
and
another
Indian
company
,
Bharat
Biotech
,
is
making
about
10
million
doses
a
month
of
its
Covaxin
shot
.
A
third
company
has
signed
an
agreement
to
produce
Russia
’
s
Sputnik
V
vaccine
later
this
year.But
that
is
a
fraction
of
what
India
needs
to
inoculate
every
adult
,
some
940
million
people.
“
It
is
like
inviting
100
people
at
your
home
for
lunch
.
You
have
resources
to
cook
for
20.
”
Dr.
Chandrakant
Lahariya
,
an
epidemiologist
,
said
on
Twitter.Already
,
health
providers
say
they
are
running
out
of
vaccines
.
Many
Indians
who
have
received
one
shot
say
they
are
having
trouble
getting
a
second.
“

when
he
went
to

.
“
We
are

were
on
Day

An

on
Wednesday

shots
crashed
because
of
the
demand

more
than
13
million

got
appointments.

Balbir

Sidhu
,
the
health
minister
in
Punjab
State
,
which
is
struggling
to
obtain
the
three
million
doses
of
the
AstraZeneca
vaccine
that
it
ordered.The
Indian
health
ministry
denied
that
there
was
a
supply
shortage
and
said
it
had
tried
to
accelerate
the
rollout
by
allowing
private
facilities
to
purchase
directly
from
manufacturers
.
But
critics
say
the
policy
could
lead
to
companies
raising
prices
for
private
buyers.In
New
Delhi
,
Dr.
Shaikh
said
her
vaccination
center
would
soon
be
unable
to
offer
even
the
150
doses
it
has
been
administering
on
an
average
day.
“
Just
thinking
about
not
being
able
to
help
at
our
vaccination
center
makes
me
cry

she
said.NEW

Vaccines
are
running
short
.
Hospitals
are
swamped
.
Lifesaving
oxygen
is
running
out
.
Each
day
,
cremation
grounds
burn
thousands
of
bodies
,
sending
up
never-ending
plumes
of
ash
that
are
turning
the
skies
gray
over
some
of
India
’
s
biggest
cities.India
’
s
stark
reversal
,
from
declaring
victory
to
suffering
its
gravest
emergency
in
decades
,
has
forced
a
national
reckoning
,
with
Mr.
Modi
at
its
center.Experts
around
the
world
once
marveled
at
how
the
country
seemed
to
have
escaped
the
worst
of
the
pandemic
,
entertaining
explanations
about
the
relative
youth
and
health
of
the
population
that
Mr.
Modi
and
his
government
embraced
,
if
not
encouraged
.
Even
now
,
Mr.
Modi
’
s
supporters
say
that
India
has
been
hit
by
a
global
phenomenon
and
that
more
time
is
needed
to
trace
the
causes
of
the
second
wave.But
independent
health
experts
and
political
analysts
say
that
Mr.
Modi
’
s
overconfidence
and
his
domineering
leadership
style
bear
a
huge
share
of
the
responsibility
.
Critics
say
his
administration
was
determined
to
cast
an
image
of
India
as
back
on
track
and
open
for
business
despite
lingering
risks
.
At
one
point
,
officials
dismissed
warnings
by
scientists
that
India
’
s
population
remained
vulnerable
and
had
not
achieved
“
herd
immunity
”
as
some
in
his
administration
were
suggesting
,
said
people
familiar
with
those
conversations.The
growing
distress
across
this
country
has
tarnished
Mr.
Modi
’
s
aura
of
political
invulnerability
,
which
he
won
by
steamrolling
the
opposition
and
by
leveraging
his
personal
charisma
to
become
India
’
s
most
powerful
politician
in
decades
.
Opposition
leaders
are
on
the
attack
,
and
his
central
hold
on
power
has
increasingly
made
him
the
target
of
scathing
criticism
online.With
parliamentary
elections
three
years
away
and
no
signs
of
defections
from
his
government
,
Mr.
Modi
’
s
power
seems
secure
.
His
government
has
stepped
up
efforts
to
get
supplies
to
desperate
patients
and
broadened
eligibility
for
scarce
vaccines
to
more
age
groups
.
Still
,
analysts
say
that
his
dominance
means
that
more
people
will
hold
him
personally
responsible
for
the
sickness
and
death
exploding
across
the
country.
“
The
bulk
of
the
blame
lies
in
Modi
’
s
governance
style
,
where
top
ministers
are
chosen
for
loyalty
rather
than
expertise
,
where
secrecy
and
image
management
is
privileged
over
transparency
,
”
said
Asim
Ali
,
a
research
scholar
at
the
Center
for
Policy
Research
in
New
Delhi.
“
In
such
a
governance
framework
,
”
he
added
,
“
when
Modi
drops
the
ball
,
as
he
did
on
Covid
,
there
can
be
disastrous
consequences.
”
At
various
points
in
recent
months
,
officials
made
decisions
that
have
come
back
to
haunt
India.Though
India
is
a
vaccine
powerhouse
,
producing
vaccines
to
protect
the
world
,
it
didn
’
t
purchase
enough
doses
to
protect
itself
.
Instead
,
while
vaccination
rates
remained
low
at
home
,
New
Delhi
exported
more
than
60
million
shots
to
bolster
its
standing
on
the
world
stage.Even
as
infections
rose
,
Mr.
Modi
decided
to
let
big
groups
gather
to
help
his
ruling
Bharatiya
Janata
Party
and
burnish
its
Hindu
nationalist
credentials
.
His
government
allowed
a
Hindu
festival
with
millions
of
worshipers
to
take
place
.
He
campaigned
in
state
elections
without
a
mask
at
rallies
of
thousands
of
maskless
supporters.Mr
.
Modi
surrounded
himself
with
allies
rather
than
experts
,
analysts
said
.
Officials
felt
too
intimidated
to
point
out
mistakes
,
the
analysts
said
,
or
to
call
into
doubt
his
claims
that
the
pandemic
was
over
.
His
party
and
his
allies
have
also
moved
to
silence
critics
,
ordering
Facebook
,
Instagram
and
Twitter
to
take
down
critical
posts
and
threatening
to
arrest
ordinary
people
for
pleading
for
oxygen.Mr
.
Modi
’
s
party
,
known
as
the
B.J.P.
,
and
the
government
declined
to
answer
specific
questions
but
listed
actions
the
government
has
taken
,
including
Mr.
Modi
holding
more
than
a
dozen
meetings
in
April
with
Air
Force
officers
,
pharmaceutical
executives
and
many
others.In
a
statement
,
the
government
said
it
“
maintained
a
steady
pace
of
coordination
and
consultation
to
prepare
an
adequate
response.
”
It
added
that
the
administration
in
February
had
“
advised
states
to
maintain
strict
vigil
”
and
“
not
let
their
guard
down.
”
Any
Indian
leader
would
have
faced
challenges
.
Hundreds
of
millions
of
poor
people
live
cheek
by
jowl
,
easy
targets
for
a
highly
contagious
virus
.
India
has
long
neglected
public
health
,
spending
less
than
$
100
per
capita
per
year
,
the
World
Bank
says
,
less
than
many
developing
nations
—
a
problem
that
predates
Mr.
Modi.On
Saturday
,
the
country
reported
over
398,000
new
virus
infections
and
more
than
3,500
deaths
.
Evidence
suggests
the
official
numbers
vastly
understate
the
toll
.
The
country
’
s
biggest
city
,
Mumbai
,
just
halted
all
vaccinations
because
it
essentially
ran
out.Analysts
say
Mr.
Modi
performed
much
better
during
the
first
wave
.
A
longtime
politician
with
humble
roots
and
a
penchant
for
dramatic
moves
,
Mr.
Modi
,
70
,
embraced
masks
and
social
distancing
from
the
earliest
days.On
March
24
,
2020
,
when
India
had
fewer
than
600
total
reported
infections
,
Mr.
Modi
ordered
his
country
into
one
of
the
strictest
lockdowns
in
the
world
at
four
hours
’
notice
.
Anxious
for
guidance
,
most
people
dutifully
stayed
indoors
.
When
Mr.
Modi
asked
citizens
to
stand
on
their
balconies
and
bang
pots
and
pans
in
solidarity
with
health
care
workers
,
millions
did
just
that.Experts
credit
that
lockdown
,
though
flawed
,
with
slowing
the
spread
.
But
the
restrictions
were
economically
devastating
,
putting
tens
of
millions
out
of
work
and
imperiling
many
of
Mr.
Modi
’
s
grandest
ambitions
,
including
turning
India
into
a
global
power
.
He
became
fearful
of
locking
down
again.After
he
eased
many
restrictions
,
infections
rose
,
reaching
almost
100,000
per
day
in
September
,
but
the
health
care
system
held
.
By
the
beginning
of
2021
,
when
infections
had
ebbed
and
the
economy
began
to
stagger
to
life
,
Mr.
Modi
and
his
team
made
a
concerted
effort
to
signal
that
India
was
back.Many
Indians
shed
their
masks
.
They
returned
to
markets
and
socialized
.
Even
more
restrictions
were
lifted
.
Covid-19
centers
set
up
during
the
first
wave
were
dismantled.His
party
’
s
leadership
declared
in
February
that
India
had
“
defeated
Covid
under
the
able
,
sensitive
,
committed
and
visionary
leadership
of
Prime
Minister
Shri
Narendra
Modi.
”
In
early
March
,
Harsh
Vardhan
,
India
’
s
health
minister
,
proclaimed
India
was
“
in
the
endgame
of
the
Covid-19
pandemic.
”
Those
who
weren
’
t
so
sure
were
sidelined
.
India
’
s
Covid-19
task
force
,
which
includes
around
20
health
professionals
,
had
been
meeting
at
least
twice
a
month
.
But
between
Jan.
11
and
April
15
,
the
task
force
did
not
meet
at
all
,
according
to
three
people
with
knowledge
of
their
deliberations
.
Two
said
that
the
government
simply
believed
the
threat
had
passed.Some
scientists
grew
concerned
with
the
official
line
that
India
,
a
nation
of
1.4
billion
,
was
approaching
herd
immunity
,
or
the
point
at
which
enough
people
in
the
population
are
immune
—
either
through
vaccinations
or
through
earlier
infection
—
that
the
virus
can
no
longer
spread
easily
.
V.K
.
Paul
,
head
of
the
Covid-19
task
force
,
said
in
January
that
“
most
of
our
highly
populated
districts
and
cities
have
had
their
run
of
the
pandemic.
”
The
concerned
scientists
pushed
back
,
according
to
the
three
people
.
Serological
studies
didn
’
t
necessarily
back
up
the
idea
,
they
said
.
Two
people
familiar
with
the
research
said
the
government
cherry-picked
results
that
suggested
a
move
toward
herd
immunity.The
vaccination
program
lost
steam
as
complacency
set
in
.
The
Modi
administration
began
exporting
Indian-made
vaccines
to
gain
favor
with
neighbors
who
might
be
tempted
to
take
vaccines
from
China
,
New
Delhi
’
s
regional
rival
.
The
government
approved
only
two
vaccines
for
use
,
both
made
in
India
,
touting
the
country
’
s
self-sufficiency
.
Less
than
two
percent
of
the
population
has
received
two
doses.Rajeev
Chandrasekhar
,
a
spokesman
for
the
B.J.P.
,
said
there
were
no
shortages
when
the
government
exported
vaccines
and
that
“
the
government
proactively
has
expanded
production
and
procurement
from
alternate
sources.
”
As
vaccinations
sputtered
,
Mr.
Modi
hit
the
campaign
trail
.
Several
states
were
holding
elections
,
and
he
focused
specifically
on
West
Bengal
,
a
state
controlled
by
an
opposition
party
.
Up
until
mid-April
,
Mr.
Modi
and
Amit
Shah
,
the
home
minister
,
campaigned
relentlessly
,
drawing
crowds
of
thousands
,
many
not
wearing
masks
and
packed
closely
together
.
Results
of
the
vote
are
expected
on
Sunday.Though
health
experts
warned
of
risks
,
Mr.
Modi
,
an
energetic
campaigner
,
seemed
to
draw
strength
from
the
rallies
.
He
told
one
in
mid-April
,
as
India
topped
200,000
new
daily
infections
,
how
happy
he
was
to
“
see
only
people
and
people
and
nothing
else.
”
Labs
in
West
Bengal
are
now
reporting
a
staggering
positivity
rate
of
50
percent
,
meaning
half
the
people
tested
have
been
infected
.
Other
states
holding
elections
are
seeing
spikes.Though
several
factors
are
at
play
and
new
,
more
dangerous
virus
variants
might
also
be
involved
,
many
people
blame
the
elections
.
In
a
recent
hearing
,
a
judge
told
a
lawyer
for
India
’
s
election
commission
that
“
your
officers
should
be
booked
on
murder
charges.
”
In
another
court
hearing
in
Delhi
,
after
a
lawyer
representing
the
local
government
complained
that
Mr.
Modi
’
s
administration
was
not
doing
enough
to
help
with
the
acute
oxygen
shortage
,
the
country
’
s
solicitor
general
responded
:
“
Let
’
s
try
and
not
be
a
crybaby.
”
Mr
.
Modi
is
likely
to
hold
on
to
power
,
thanks
to
a
weak
opposition
and
his
ability
to
fire
up
his
Hindu
nationalist
base
.
Even
his
image
has
changed
;
Mr.
Modi
has
lost
the
baseball
cap
and
chic
sunglasses
he
wore
a
year
ago
and
grown
his
hair
and
beard
long
,
reminiscent
for
some
of
a
Hindu
sage.
“
He
’
s
just
a
unique
political
animal
,
”
said
Milan
Vaishnav
,
the
director
of
the
South
Asia
program
at
the
Carnegie
Endowment
for
International
Peace
.
“
He
has
this
charisma
,
an
allure
,
a
magnetism
,
a
very
compelling
personal
story
,
and
he
has
enormous
personal
credibility
with
the
average
voter.
”
Even
now
,
Mr.
Vaishnav
added
,
“
people
like
Modi
and
they
will
find
ways
to
justify
it.
”
NEW
DELHI
—
Within
the
world
’
s
worst
coronavirus
outbreak
,
few
treasures
are
more
coveted
than
an
empty
oxygen
canister
.
India
’
s
hospitals
desperately
need
the
metal
cylinders
to
store
and
transport
the
lifesaving
gas
as
patients
across
the
country
gasp
for
breath.So
a
local
charity
reacted
with
outrage
when
one
supplier
more
than
doubled
the
price
,
to
nearly
$
200
each
.
The
charity
called
the
police
,
who
discovered
what
could
be
one
of
the
most
brazen
,
dangerous
scams
in
a
country
awash
with
coronavirus-related
fraud
and
black-market
profiteering.The
police
say
the
supplier
—
a
business
called
Varsha
Engineering
,
essentially
a
scrapyard
—
had
been
repainting
fire
extinguishers
and
selling
them
as
oxygen
canisters
.
The
consequences
could
be
deadly
:
The
less-sturdy
fire
extinguishers
might
explode
if
filled
with
high-pressure
oxygen.
“
This
guy
should
be
charged
with
homicide
,
”
said
Mukesh
Khanna
,
a
volunteer
at
the
charity
.
“
He
was
playing
with
lives.

A
coronavirus
second
wave
has
devastated
India
’
s
medical
system
and
undermined
confidence
in
the
ability
of
Prime
Minister
Narendra
Modi
’
s
government
to
treat
its
people
and
quell
the
disease
.
There
are
widely
believed
to
be
far
more
deaths
than
the
thousands
reported
each
day
.
Hospitals
are
full
.
Drugs
,
vaccines
,
oxygen
and
other
supplies
are
running
out.Pandemic
profiteers
are
filling
the
gap
.
Medicine
,
oxygen
and
other
supplies
are
brokered
online
or
in
hushed
phone
calls
.
In
many
cases
,
the
sellers
prey
on
the
desperation
and
grief
of
families.
“
These
people
,
the
cyber
criminals
,
were
already
out
there
,
”
said
Muktesh
Chander
,
a
special
commissioner
for
the
Delhi
Police
.
“
The
moment
they
got
this
opportunity
they
switched
on
to
this
modus
operandi.
”
Sometimes
the
goods
are
fraudulent
,
and
some
are
potentially
harmful
.
Last
week
,
police
officers
in
the
state
of
Uttar
Pradesh
accused
one
group
of
stealing
used
funeral
shrouds
from
bodies
and
selling
them
as
new
.
The
day
before
,
officers
in
the
same
state
discovered
more
than
100
vials
of
fake
remdesivir
,
an
antiviral
drug
that
many
doctors
in
India
are
prescribing
despite
questions
about
its
effectiveness.Citing
the
predatory
sales
,
a
top
court
in
New
Delhi
said
this
month
that
“
the
moral
fabric
of
the
society
is
dismembered.
”
Over
the
past
month
,
the
New
Delhi
police
have
arrested
more
than
210
people
on
allegations
of
cheating
,
hoarding
,
criminal
conspiracy
or
fraud
in
connection
with
Covid-related
scams
.
Similarly
,
the
police
in
Uttar
Pradesh
have
arrested
160
people.
“
I
have
seen
all
kinds
of
predators
and
all
forms
of
depravity
,
”
said
Vikram
Singh
,
a
former
police
chief
in
Uttar
Pradesh
,
“
but
this
level
of
predation
and
depravity
I
have
not
seen
in
the
36
years
of
my
career
or
in
my
life.
”
The
scams
and
profiteering
represent
the
flip
side
of
the
huge
online
help
system
that
has
emerged
to
fill
the
void
left
by
the
government
.
Do-gooders
across
the
country
have
swooped
in
to
connect
those
in
need
with
lifesaving
resources.The
ad
hoc
system
has
limits
.
Vital
supplies
like
oxygen
are
still
stuck
in
bottlenecks
,
and
people
keep
dying
after
hospitals
run
out
.
Vaccine
and
pharmaceutical
makers
can
’
t
keep
up
.
Politicians
in
some
places
are
threatening
people
who
publicly
plead
for
supplies.That
empowers
the
black
market
,
with
its
exorbitant
prices
and
dicey
goods
.
Many
people
feel
they
have
no
choice.Rohit
Shukla
,
a
graduate
student
in
New
Delhi
,
said
that
after
his
grandmother
died
in
late
April
in
a
neighboring
state
,
an
ambulance
driver
demanded
$
70
for
the
three-mile
ride
from
the
hospital
to
the
cremation
ground
,
over
10
times
the
normal
price
.
When
the
family
arrived
,
workers
demanded
$
70
for
firewood
that
should
have
cost
$
7.Supply
and
demand
might
account
for
some
price
increases
,
Mr.
Shukla
said
,
but
he
suspects
more
than
that.
“
Everyone
is
trying
to
profit
from
this
pandemic
,
”
he
said
.
“
I
don
’
t
know
what
has
happened
to
people.
”
Some
of
the
more
egregious
examples
can
be
found
in
the
country
’
s
struggling
hospital
system
.
Infections
and
deaths
are
widely
believed
to
be
many
times
more
numerous
than
the
official
figures
indicate
,
and
in
hospitals
across
India
,
all
the
beds
have
been
filled
and
people
are

by
one
doctor
in
Madhya
Pradesh
have
gone
viral
.
The
doctor
,
Sanjeev
Kumrawat
,
said
he
tried
to
stop
a
local
activist
for
India
’
s
governing
party
from
selling
access
to
beds
in
a
government
hospital
where
he
works
.
“
We
all
know
that
to
get
a
bed
is
a
big
struggle
all
around
,
”
Dr.
Kumrawat
said
in
an
interview
.
“
Government
resources
are
to
be
distributed
equitably
and
can
’
t
become
the
property
of
one
person.
”
The
activist
,
named
Abhay
Vishwakarma
,
disputed
the
accusations
but
said
he
had
asked
the
local
authorities
to
investigate
.
“
I
don
’
t
know
why
the
doctor
has
accused
me
,
”
he
said
in
an
interview.A
brisk
market
has
developed
for
contraband
plasma
,
which
many
doctors
in
India
have
used
to
treat
Covid-19
patients
.
Police
officers
in
the
city
of
Noida
,
in
Uttar
Pradesh
,
on
Wednesday
arrested
two
men
they
accused
of
selling
plasma
for
up
to
$
1,000
per
unit
.
According
to
the
police
,
one
of
the
men
begged
for
plasma
donors
for
his
own
needs
on
social
media
,
then
sold
the
plasma
through
a
middleman.Young
cybersleuths

Malviya
,
a

,
flagged

advertising
a

tocilizumab
,
an
anti-inflammatory
drug
sometimes
used
to
treat
Covid-19
patients
with
pneumonia
that
is
hard
to

The

.
Ms.
Malviya
flagged
the
post
as
a
possible

and
received
a
flurry
of
messages
,
but
they
were
from
people
desperate
for
the
drug.
“
This
is
the
kind
of
helplessness
people
are
facing
these
days
,
”
she
said.Remdesivir
,
the
antiviral
drug
,
has
been
the
focus
of
a
number
of
scams
.
The
police
in
New
Delhi
recently
said
they
had
arrested
four
people
working
at
medical
facilities
who
swiped
unused
vials
of
remdesivir
from
dead
patients
and
sold
them
for
about
$
400
each
.
Before
the
drug
became
so
scarce
in
India
,
hospitals
were
charging
about
$
65
for
it.The
Surin
family
,
from
the
city
of
Lucknow
,
recently
paid
more
than
$
1,400
to
a
middleman
for
six
doses
of
remdesivir
.
Lucky
Surin
,
an
event

,
said
the
family
had
little
choice
.
Her
mother
and
sister-in-law
were
seriously
sick
.
Her
mother
has
since
died.
“
What
do
we
do
?
”
asked
Ms.
Surin
.
“
If
the
doctor
has
prescribed
it
,
then
you
have
to
buy
it.
”
Dr

Jawed
Khan
,
owner
of
the
hospital
that
prescribed
the
drug
for
the
Surins
but
couldn
’
t
provide
it
,
said
families
could
procure
their
own
and
physicians
would
check
vials
and
labels
for
authenticity.Some
scammers
try
to
get
around
such
safeguards
.
The
police
in
the
western
state
of
Gujarat
this
month
discovered
thousands
of
vials
of
fake
remdesivir
during
a
bust
.
A
tipster
led
them
to
a
factory
where
they
recovered
3,371
vials
that
were
filled
with
glucose
,
water
and
salt.Many
other
doses
had
already
been
sold
and
maybe
even
put
into
patients
’
bodies
,
the
Gujarat
police
said
,
posing
a
public
health
risk
of
unknown
scale
.
Those
who
turn
to
the
black
market
often
know
they
are
taking
a
gamble.Anirudh
Singh
Rathore
,
a
59-year-old
cloth
trader
in
New
Delhi
,
was
desperately
seeking
remdesivir
for
his
ill
wife
,
Sadhna
.
He
acquired
two
vials
at
the
government-mandated
price
of
about
$
70
each
.
He
needed
four
more.Through
social
media
,
he
found
a
seller
willing
to
part
with
four
more
vials
for
about
five
times
that
price
.
First
,
two
arrived
.
When
the
second
two
were
delivered
,
he
noticed
the
packaging
was
different
from
the
first
batch
.
They
had
been
made
by
different
companies
,
the
seller
explained.The
Rathores
had
their
doubts
,
but
Sadhna
’
s
oxygen
levels
were
dropping
and
they
were
desperate
.
Mr.
Rathore
said
they
gave
the
doses
to
the
doctors
,
who
injected
them
without
being
able
to
determine
whether
they
were
real
or
fake
.
On
May
3
,
Ms.
Rathore
died.Mr
.
Rathore
filed
a
police
report
and
one
of
the
sellers
was
arrested
,
he
said
,
but
he
has
been
racked
with
guilt.
“
I
have
the
regret
that
probably
my
wife
would
have
been
saved
if
those
injections
were
original

”
he
said
,
adding
that
the

“

KATHMANDU
,
Nepal
—
Most
of
Nepal
is
under
lockdown
,
its
hospitals
overwhelmed
.
Bangladesh
suspended
vaccination
sign-ups
after
promised
supplies
were
cut
off
.
Sri
Lanka
’
s
hopes
of
a
tourism-led
economic
revival
have
collapsed.As
India
battles
a
horrific
surge
of
the
coronavirus
,
the
effects
have
spilled
over
to
its
neighbors
.
Most
nearby
countries
have
sealed
their
borders
.
Several
that
had
been
counting
on
Indian-made
vaccines
are
pleading
with
China
and
Russia
instead.The
question
is
whether
that
will
be
enough
,
in
a
region
that
shares
many
of
the
risk
factors
that
made
India
so
vulnerable
:
densely
populated
cities
,
heavy
air
pollution
,
fragile
health
care
systems
and
large
populations
of
poor
workers
who
must
weigh
the
threat
of
the
virus
against
the
possibility
of
starvation.Though
the
countries
’
outbreaks
can
’
t
all
be
linked
to
India
,
officials
across
the
region
have
expressed
growing
dread
over
how
easily
their
fates
could
follow
that
of
their
neighbor.
“
I
feel
like
it
’
s
a
world
war
situation
,
”
said
Dr.
Rajan
Pandey
,
a
physician
in
Banke
,
a
Nepali
district
along
the
India
border
,
who
said
he
was
turning
away
30
patients
asking
for
hospital
beds
every
day.
“
If
lockdown
was
enforced
two
weeks
ago
,
borders
were
closed
and
migrant
workers
returning
from
India
were
quarantined
better
,
this
situation
could
have
been
avoided
,
”
he
said.As
is
,
he
added
,
“
we
are
still
waiting
for
the
worst.
”
Nepal
shows
most
clearly
how
the
crisis
has
rippled
.
After
an
initial
wave
last
year
,
cases
in
the
Himalayan
nation
of
30
million
had
plunged
by
January
.
Residents
gathered
for
Nepali
New
Year
celebrations
last
month
,
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
migrant
workers
returned
to
India
,
where
they
go
each
year
in
search
of
jobs.But
as
the
new
surge
began
raging
across
India
,
many
of
those
workers
returned
across
the
porous
,
1,100-mile
border
.
With
them
came
the
virus.In
the
border
district
of
Kanchanpur
,
more
than
1,500
Nepalis
come
back
from
India
each
day
.
About
one-fifth
of
them
test
positive
,
said
Ram
Kumar
Mahato
,
the
chief
district
officer
there.In
Banke
,
as
many
as
9,000
workers
returned
last
week
,
said
Rajesh
Saru
Magar
,
a
UNICEF
worker
.
Only
about
20
percent
are
being
tested
because
of
a
lack
of
capacity
,
Mr.
Magar
said
.
Of
those
,
30
percent
were
positive.Yet
even
now
,
Nepal
’
s
government
has
closed
only
22
of
its
35
border
checkpoints
,
a
decision
that
officials
have
said
is
necessary
to
ensure
that
citizens
can
return
.
Until
late
April
,
Nepal
also
allowed
passengers
from
India
to
transit
through
the
capital
,
Kathmandu
,
a
possible
loophole
for
those
seeking
to
get
around
other
countries
’
bans
on
travel
from
India.Now
,
Nepal
is
recording
as
many
as
9,000
infections
per
day
,
with
more
than
40
percent
of
tests
coming
back
positive
.
More
than
4,200
people
had
died
by
Wednesday
evening
.
Experts
say
the
cases
are
likely
being
undercounted.Still
,
imported
cases
are
not
the
only
reason
for
the
crisis
engulfing
Nepal.As
in
India
,
the
government
did
not
expand
health
facilities
when
coronavirus
cases
appeared
to
be
under
control
last
year
,
and
it
was
slow
to
enforce
social
distancing
restrictions
when
it
became
clear
that
they
were
not.Critics
have
pointed
to
huge
,
maskless
rallies
in
India
hosted
by
Prime
Minister
Narendra
Modi
even
as
infections
rose
.
Likewise
,
both
the
ruling
and
opposition
parties
in
Nepal
held
large
political
gatherings
after
the
prime
minister
dissolved
Parliament
in
December.
“
Because
of
this
,
the
virus
reached
every
corner
of
the
country
,
”
said
Dr.
Krishna
Prasad
Paudel
,
the
director
of
the
epidemiology
and
disease
control
division
at
Nepal
’
s
health
ministry.Prime
Minister
K.P
.
Sharma
Oli
told
CNN
on
Saturday
that
Nepal
’
s
situation
was
“
under
control
”
but
acknowledged
that
“
political
instability
”
had
led
to
“
some
mistakes.
”
On
Monday
night
,
Mr.
Oli
lost
a
vote
of
no
confidence
in
Parliament
,
throwing
Nepal
into
further
turmoil.Aid
workers
have
warned
that
the
parallels
between
Nepal
and
India
may
continue
,
as
hospitals
turn
all
but
the
most
critically
ill
patients
away
.
With
medical
oxygen
supplies
running
short
,
as
they
did
in
India
,
Nepal
’
s
government
has
imposed
quotas
for
each
hospital
,
which
doctors
say
are
far
from
adequate
.
Reports
of
patients
dying
from
insufficient
oxygen
have
spread.
“
What
is
happening
in
India
right
now
is
a
horrifying
preview
of
Nepal
’
s
future
if
we
can
not
contain
this
latest
Covid
surge
,
”
Dr.
Netra
Prasad
Timsina
,
the
chairwoman
of
the
Nepal
Red
Cross
,
said
in
a
statement
last
week.Vaccines
are
unlikely
to
help
immediately
.
Nepal
paid
for
two
million
doses
from
India
’
s
Serum
Institute
,
the
world
’
s
largest
producer
of
vaccines
.
But
as
India
’
s
crisis
has
escalated
,
its
government
has
essentially
halted
exports
,
leaving
Nepal
a
million
doses
short.India
’
s
pause
has
also
scrambled
vaccination
plans
in
Bangladesh
.
Late
last
month
,
the
authorities
there
announced
that
they
would
temporarily
stop
accepting
new
registrations
for
shots
after
supplies
from
the
Serum
Institute
were
cut
off.Now
,
Bangladesh
is
short
roughly
1.5
million
of
the
doses
it
needs
to
administer
second
shots
,
let
alone
first
ones
.
It
has
turned
to
China
and
Russia
for
new
supplies.Despite
the
shortfall
,
Bangladesh
has
otherwise
fared
better
than
many
of
its
neighbors
.
Numbers
have
dropped
rapidly
since
an
April
surge
,
even
though
Bangladesh
,
like
India
,
has
many
crowded
slums
and
impoverished
laborers
who
continued
to
work
through
lockdowns.Still
,
officials
warn
that
its
luck
may
not
hold
.
On
Saturday
,
the
authorities
announced
that
they
had
detected
Bangladesh
’
s
first
case
of
a
variant
that
was
first
discovered
in
India.
“
If
India
’
s
present
Covid-19
infection
and
death
situation
happens
in
Bangladesh
,
our
situation
will
be
like
falling
trees
during
a
heavy
storm
,
”
Anwarul
Iqbal
,
a
Bangladeshi
public
health
expert
,
said.Cases
are
also
rising
along
Bhutan
’
s
border
with
India
,
even
though
the
country
of
about
750,000
has
at
least
partially
vaccinated
95
percent
of
its
eligible
population
.
Bhutan
last
month
suspended
entry
for
foreign
workers
,
after
experts
cited
concerns
about
laborers
coming
from
India.The
border
between
Pakistan
and
India
was
closed
even
before
the
pandemic
because
of
political
tensions
.
But
in
Pakistan
,
too
,
cases
are
rising
.
Asad
Umar
,
the
official
leading
its
coronavirus
response
,
cited
the
fact
that
“
the
entire
region
is
exploding
with
cases
and
deaths
”
to
explain
new
lockdowns.Even
in
countries
where
a
spring
surge
has
not
been
directly
linked
to
the
Indian
outbreak
,
the
ripple
effects
have
created
fresh
pain.Experts
have
attributed
Sri
Lanka
’
s
new
wave
,
which
has
brought
its
highest
daily
numbers
yet
,
to
domestic
holiday
travel
last
month
.
But
the
crisis
in
India
led
to
the
suspension
of
travel
between
the
two
countries
,
dashing
hopes
that
a
planned
air
travel
bubble
would
revive
Sri
Lanka
’
s
flailing
tourism
industry
.
In
2019
,
India
was
the
country
’
s
largest
source
of
tourists
,
accounting
for
nearly
one-fifth
of
arrivals.Nipuna
Lokuhetty
,
a
director
of
a
tour
company
that
mostly
serves
Indian
tourists
,
has
seen
just
a
handful
of
visitors
this
year
.
Mr.
Lokuhetty
,
32
,
who
lives
in
Rajagiriya
,
a
Colombo
suburb
,
said
he
had
laid
off
70
percent
of
his
employees
since
the
start
of
the
pandemic
.
The
salaries
of
those
remaining
were
cut
at
least
in
half.
“
The
travel
bubble
was
a
great
initiative
,
”
he
said
.
“
Unfortunately
,
we
couldn
’
t
reap
any
benefits
from
it
because
of
the
Covid-19
situation
in
India.
”
In
Nepal
,
as
staggering
as
the
new
numbers
are
,
experts
have
said
the
surge
will
likely
take
more
than
a
month
to
peak
.
Nepal
’
s
health
care
system
is
even
more
strained
than
India
’
s
;
when
the
government
released
its
coronavirus
response
plan
last
May
,
it
estimated
that
local
facilities
would
be
insufficient
if
there
were
more
than
5,000
active
cases
at
once
.
Now
there
are
more
than
100,000.For
many
Nepalis
,
anger
and
sorrow
have
mixed
with
utter
helplessness.Pramod
Pathak
,
a
businessman
in
the
border
district
of
Kailali
,
has
watched
in
anxiety
and
sorrow
as
migrant
workers
returned
from
India
.
They
have
crowded
every
day
into
overwhelmed
testing
centers
,
or
—
for
the
many
for
whom
there
are
no
tests
—
simply
crammed
into
shared
cars
and
returned
to
their
villages.
“
The
virus
is
transmitting
as
they
travel
in
jam-packed
vehicles
,
”
Mr.
Pathak
said
.
“
There
’
s
no
safety
for
them
no
matter
where
they
go
—
be
it
India
or
Nepal.

AHMEDABAD
,
India
—
In
the
stifling
,
tightly
packed
medical
ward
at
Civil
Hospital
,
the
ear
,
nose
and
throat
specialist
moved
briskly
from
one
bed
to
the
next
,
shining
a
flashlight
into
one
patient

examining

X-rays.The
specialist
,
Dr.
Bela
Prajapati
,
oversees
treatment
for
nearly
400
patients
with
mucormycosis
,
a
rare
and
often
deadly
fungal
disease
that
has
exploded
across
India
on
the
coattails
of
the
coronavirus
pandemic
.
Unprepared
for
this
spring
’
s
devastating
Covid-19
second
wave
,
many
of
India
’
s
hospitals
took
desperate
steps
to
save
lives
—
steps
that
may
have
opened
the
door
to
yet
another
deadly
disease.
“
The
pandemic
has
precipitated
an
epidemic
,
”
Dr.
Prajapati
said.In
three
weeks
,
the
number
of
cases
of
the
disease
—
known
by
the
misnomer
“
black
fungus
,
”
because
it
is
found
on
dead
tissue
—
shot
up
to
more
than
30,000
from
negligible
levels
.
States
have
recorded
more
than
2,100
deaths
,
according
to
news
reports
.
The
federal
health
ministry
in
New
Delhi
,
which
is
tracking
nationwide
cases
to
allot
scarce
and
expensive
antifungal
medicine
,
has
not
released
a
fatalities
figure.The
coronavirus
pandemic
has
drawn
stark
lines
between
rich
nations
and
poor
,
and
the
mucormycosis
epidemic
in
India
stands
as
the
latest
manifestation
.
During
the
second
wave
,
which
struck
India
in
April
,
its
creaky
,
underfunded
medical
system
lacked
beds
,
oxygen
and
other
necessities
as
infections
and
deaths
soared.The
mucormycosis
epidemic
adds
even
more
urgency
to
the
difficult
task
of
protecting
India
’
s
1.4
billion
people
.
Only
a
small
fraction
have
been
vaccinated
against
the
coronavirus
,
and
they
remain
vulnerable
to
a
third
wave
and
the
consequences
that
could
follow.
“
Mucormycosis
will
tail
off
and
go
back
to
baseline
as
the
Covid
cases
subside
,
”
said
Dr.
Dileep
Mavalankar
,
an
epidemiologist
.
“
But
it
may
come
back
in
the
third
wave
unless
we
find
out
why
it
is
happening.
”
Many
doctors
in
India
think
they
know
why
.
The
bone-and-tissue-eating
fungus
can
attack
the
gastrointestinal
tract
,
the
lungs
,
the
skin
and
the
sinuses
,
where
it
often
spreads
to
the
eye
socket
and
the
brain
if
left
untreated
.
Treatment
for
the
disease
involves
complex
,
often
disfiguring
surgery
and
an
uncommon
and
expensive
drug
,
contributing
to
a
mortality
rate
above
50
percent.Mucormycosis
is
not
passed
from
person
to
person
.
It
develops
from
commonplace
spores
that
sometimes
build
up
in
homes
and
hospitals
.
Doctors
believe
India
’
s
crowded
hospitals
,
and
their
dire
lack
of
medical
oxygen
,
left
the
fungus
an
opening.Without
enough
oxygen
to
go
around
,
doctors
in
many
places
injected
patients
with
steroids
,
a
standard
treatment
for
doctors
battling
Covid
globally
.
They
can
reduce
inflammation
in
the
lungs
and
help
Covid
patients
breathe
more
easily.Many
doctors
prescribed
steroids
in
quantities
and
for
durations
that
far
exceed
World
Health
Organization
recommendations
,
said
Arunaloke
Chakrabarti
,
a
microbiologist
and
the
co-author
of
a
study
examining
the
causes
of
India
’
s
mucormycosis
outbreak
.
Those
steroids
may
have
compromised
patient
immune
systems
and
made
Covid-19
patients
more
susceptible
to
fungal
spores.The
steroids
may
have
also
dangerously
increased
blood
sugar
levels
,
leaving
people
with
diabetes
vulnerable
to
mucormycosis
.
It
could
also
increase
the
chance
of
blood
clots
,
leading
to
malnourished
tissue
,
which
the
“
fungus
attacks
,
”
Dr.
Prajapati
said.Desperate
doctors
may
not
have
had
the
chance
to
ask
patients
about
whether
they
had
diabetes
or
other
conditions
before
resorting
to
steroids.
“
Doctors
hardly
had
any
time
to
do
patient
management
,
”
Dr.
Chakrabarti
said
.
“
They
were
all
looking
at
how
to
take
care
of
the
respiratory
tract.
”
According
to
the
health
ministry
,
about
four
out
of
five
mucormycosis
patients
have
had
Covid-19
.
More
than
half
have
diabetes.Alok
Kumar
Chaudry
,
a
30-year-old
engineer
with
surgical
tape
over
his
left
eye
and
hooked
up
to
an
I.V
.
drip
at
Civil
Hospital
,
is
one
of
those
with
mucormycosis
who
first
came
down
with
Covid.He
was
studying
for
India
’
s
civil
service
exam
in
April
in
New
Delhi
when
the
second
wave
hit
.
After
testing
positive
for
the
coronavirus
,
and
with
hospital
beds
,
drugs
and
oxygen
scarce
,
he
jumped
onto
a
train
to
his
older
brother
’
s
home
in
rural
Gujarat
.
There
,
his
oxygen
levels
plummeted
to
a
potentially
lethal
54
percent.After
two
weeks
on
oxygen
support
and
steroids
at
a
local
hospital
,
he
recovered
from
Covid-19
but
developed
an
acute
headache
on
the
left
side
of
his
brain
.
Doctors
thought
that
steroids
may
have
caused
it
and
that
it
would
go
away.
“
Suddenly
vision
in
my
left
eye
went
blank
,
”
Mr.
Chaudry
said.An
M.R.I
.
showed
mucormycosis
.
The
doctors
said
they
would
have
to
remove
his
eye.He
went
to
Ahmedabad
’
s
Civil
Hospital
for
a
second
opinion
.
Five
specialists
oversaw
a
surgery
that
involved
scraping
away
the
dead
tissue
in
his
sinus
tract
.
To
clear
out
remaining
infection
,
he
received
a
15-day
course
of
amphotericin
B
,
an
antifungal
medication.Dr
.
Chakrabarti
said
that
if
Mr.
Chaudry
kept
his
eye
,
he
could
still
lose
his
life
,
since
surgeons
couldn
’
t
remove
the
thin
layer
of
infection
behind
his
eye
without
removing
the
eye
itself.
“
I
’
ve
lost
vision
in
my
left
eye
,
my
studies
have
suffered
,
”
Mr.
Chaudry
said
.
“
Definitely
I
want
to
know
why
mucor
has
formed
.
If
it
’
s
faulty
treatment
,
then
someone
is
responsible
.
If
it
’
s
the
wrath
of
God
,
what
can
I
do
?
”
The
study
that
Dr.
Chakrabarti
co-wrote
,
published
this
month
by
the
U.S.
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
,
said
that
heavy
use
of
steroids
,
the
correlation
with
diabetes
and
the
unsanitary
conditions
at
some
hospitals
had
played
a
role.Even
before
the
pandemic
,
India
recorded
about
50
mucormycosis
cases
a
year
,
compared
with
,
on
average
,
a
single
case
every
two
years
in
the
United
States
and
Western
Europe
.
Environmental
conditions
play
a
part
,
as
does
the
incidence
of
diabetes
—
India
has
more
than
twice
as
many
people
with
the
condition
as
the
United
States
does.Usually
in
India
,
mucormycosis
afflicts
people
with
diabetes
who
are
either
unaware
of
their
condition
or
who
are
not
taking
insulin
properly
.
But
in
the
current
outbreak
,
many
patients
had
no
history
of
diabetes
.
The
common
denominator
was
a
Covid-19
infection
treated
with
steroids
,
clinicians
and
researchers
say.The
government
in
Ahmedabad
,
in
Gujarat
,
declared
mucormycosis
an
epidemic
in
May
.
Other
states
have
followed
.
Whether
patients
live
or
die
often
depends
on
how
quickly
they
undergo
debridement
surgery
that
removes
the
fungus
and
then
start
a
two-week
course
of
amphotericin
B.Prime
Minister
Narendra
Modi
,
who
is
from
Gujarat
,
described
the
fungal
disease
as
a
new
“
challenge
”
and
said
it
was
“
important
to
create
systems
to
tackle
it.
”
India
makes
small
supplies
of
amphotericin
B
,
which
can
be
obtained
free
of
charge
at
some
public
hospitals
.
But
because
supplies
are
limited
,
India
is
importing
it
from
the
United
States
,
where
it
costs
about
$
300
per
vial
.
Each
patient
needs
60
to
100
vials
.
Gilead
Sciences
,
the
American
manufacturer
,
has
donated
about
200,000
vials.Doctors
are
using
cheaper
drugs
that
are
as
effective
but
more
toxic
,
posing
a
risk
of
kidney
damage.
“
That
’
s
a
very
painful
choice
,
”
said
Dr.
Atul
Patel
,
an
infectious
diseases
specialist
at
the
private
Sterling
Hospital
in
Ahmedabad
who
has
treated
dozens
of
mucormycosis
patients
in
the
outbreak.Dr
.
Patel
,
another
of
the
study
’
s
authors
,
said
that
steroids
,
which
in
India
are
commonly
prescribed
for
routine
ailments
such
as
diarrhea
or
fever
,
had
been
prescribed
to
Covid-19
patients
with
mild
infections
who
didn
’
t
need
them.That
was
the
case
for
one
of
Dr.
Patel
’
s
patients
,
Ambaben
Heerabhai
Patel
,
60
,
the
matriarch
of
a
farming
family
in
rural
Gujarat
,
who
is
paying
about
$
700
a
day
for
antifungal
treatment
and
other
services
at
Sterling.It
’
s
a
steep
cost
,
but
Ms.
Patel
had
seen
Dr.
Patel
—
no
relation
—
for
previous
health
issues
related
to
her
diabetes
.
After
back-to-back
infections
of
Covid-19
and
then
mucormycosis
,
she
did
not
want
to
take
any
chances.Arriving
at
the
hospital
May
17
with
an
intense
headache
and
facial
numbness
,
Ms.
Patel
said
in
early
June
from
her
private
room
at
Sterling
Hospital
that
she
felt
healthy
for
the
first
time
in
more
than
a
month.Of
Dr.
Patel
,
she
said
,
“
he
’
s
like
my

”
Infections
are
soaring
.
So
are
deaths
.
Whole
cities
are
under
lockdown
.
And
the
government
seems
powerless
to
help.India
is
in
the
grip
of
a
coronavirus
crisis
.
Experts
agree
that
the
spread
is
probably
even
worse
than
the
official
statistics
suggest
.
In
many
parts
of
the
country
,
hospital
beds
,
supplemental
oxygen
and
other
vital
supplies
are
running
short.As
Western
countries
roll
out
mass
vaccination
campaigns
,
only
about
3
percent
of
India
’
s
population
is
fully
inoculated
.
Though
conditions
are
slowly
improving
in
New
Delhi
and
Mumbai
,
the
virus
appears
to
be
spreading
largely
unchecked
through
the
rest
of
the
country.The
New
York
Times
asked
readers
in
India
to
describe
their
lives
in
the
midst
of
the
pandemic
with
words
and
photos
.
They
wrote
about
fear
and
loss
,
anxiety
and
boredom
.
Some
wrote
about
their
anger
at
the
stumbling
response
by
India
’
s
government
under
Prime
Minister
Narendra
Modi
.
But
they
also
wrote
about
family
and
friends
who
have
helped
them
cope
,
and
efforts
they
have
made
to
help
neighbors
and
strangers
alike.
“
A
lot
of
people
my
age
have
been
helping
people
find
resources
like
hospital
beds
,
oxygen
cylinders
,
medication
,
etc.
,
through
social
media
by
verifying
whatever
leads
are
floating
around
on
the
internet
and
sending
them
to
whoever
needs
them
.
I
’
ve
been
working
with
one
such
group
.
I
realize
that
it
is
a
necessary
job
in
these
times
,
but
it
’
s
also
incredibly
draining
.
It
is
the
sign
of
a
completely
broken
system
that
teenagers
have
to
band
together
and
work
themselves
to
exhaustion
trying
to
answer
all
these
desperate
pleas
all
over
Twitter
.
And
it
’
s
getting
harder
to
do
by
the
day
as
things
worsen
because
resources
get
exhausted
very
quickly
.
Most
of
the
time
we
just
end
up
calling
a
lot
of
numbers
and
get
no
response
,
and
when
we
do
it
’
s
usually
people
saying
there
’
s
nothing
they
can
do
for
us
.
It
’
s
heartbreaking
when
people
around
are
just
suffering
and
dying
and
there
’
s
so
little
you
can
do
to
help
.
We
’
re
all
terrified
and
burnt
out
and
this
is
a
very
unsustainable
system
of
getting
people
access
to
health
care
.
You
can
’
t
leave
it
to
the
citizens
to
bear
the
brunt
of
a
health
care
system
that
’
s
crumbling.

at

an
out-of-body

It

hard

every

full
of

The
worst
part
:
There

almost
nothing
you
can
do
to

It

hours
of

calling

begging

to
actually
find
some
solutions

if
that
even

By

you

The

I

The

has
done
little
to
make

Also
,
the

initially
were
more
of
a

than
a

who
didn
’
t
see
the
warning
signs
of
a
corrupt
,
inept
distribution
of
resources
.
Slapping
each
of
those
complacent
idiots
who
voted
into
power
a
ruthless
demagogue
who
wins
elections
by
stoking
fear
and
resentment
but
is
a
dud
when
it
comes
to
long-term
policymaking
,
tough
decision-making
and
leadership.

sending
his
submission
,
Mr.
Khera
said
,
he
and
his
family
have
recovered.
“
Many
friends
have
been
infected
,
and
we
call
each
other
every
day
to
share
a
joke
and
to
stay
positive
and
make
plans
to
meet
in
the
future
.
Still
frightening
,
but
we
are
coping
.
I
also
try
to
help
people
overcome
disinformation
and
keep
telling
people
that
most
of
us
who
are
infected
will
recover
.
I
ask
people
to
avoid
panic
buying
and
seeking
unvalidated
cures
.
Since
last
year
I
have
exercised
regularly
and
continue
to
do
so
even
while
infected
and
isolated
.
I
am
also
a
pistol
shooter
for
my
state
of
Maharashtra
,
so
mental
conditioning
has
been
an
important
part
of
my
training
.
I
meditate
for
10
minutes
each
day
to
stay
positive.

“
It
is
very
frightening
.
Half
of
the
people
I
know
have
been
tested
positive
or
have
been
previously
infected
.
We
haven
’
t
stepped
out
of
the
house
for
the
past
two
weeks
,
and
it
has
taken
a
greater
toll
on
our
physical
and
mental
health
.
The
only
rule
is
to
avoid
contact
.
If
you
want
to
keep
your
close
ones
safe
,
then
you
need
to
keep
them
away
for
a
while
.
My
mother
is
an
essential
worker
,
and
I
have
seen
her
doing
grocery
shopping
for
many
needy
people
who
are
quarantined
.
It
’
s
something
I
’
m
proud
of
.
In
times
like
these
,
we
need
to
hold
on
to
humanity
and
have
faith
in
whatever
you
believe
in
.
Being
an
atheist
,
I
have
faith
in
science
and
myself.
