office
heard
the
first
reports
of
a
previously-unknown
virus
behind
a
number
of
pneumonia
cases
in
wuhan
,
a
city
in
eastern
china
with
a
population
of
over
11
million.what
started
as
an
epidemic
mainly
limited
to
china
has
now
become
a
truly
global
pandemic
.
there
have
now
been
over
5,595,091
confirmed
cases
and
350,547
deaths
,
according
the
john
hopkins
university
covid-19
dashboard
,
which
collates
information
from
national
and
international
health
authorities
.
the
disease
has
been
detected
in
more
than
200
countries
and
territories
,
with
the
us
,
brazil
and
russia
experiencing
the
most
widespread
outbreaks
,
followed
by
the
uk
,
spain
and
italy
.
in
the
uk
,
there
have
been
265,227
confirmed
cases
and
37,048
deaths
as
of
may
26
.
the
true
number
of
infections
and
deaths
is
likely
to
be
considerably
higher.the
chinese
government
responded
to
the
initial
outbreak
by
placing
wuhan
and
nearby
cities
under
a
de-facto
quarantine
encompassing
roughly
50
million
people
in
hubei
province
.
this
quarantine
is
now
slowly
being
lifted
,
as
authorities
watch
to
see
whether
cases
will
rise
again
.
the
us
is
now
the
new
epicentre
of
the
covid-19
outbreak
.
as
of
may
27
,
the
country
has
1,681,418
confirmed
infections
and
98,929
deaths
.
in
italy
,
where
the
death
toll
surpassed
that
of
china
on
march
19
,
the
government
took
the
unprecedented
step
of
extending
a
lockdown
to
the
entire
country
,
shutting
cinemas
,
theatres
,
gyms
,
discos
and
pubs
and
banning
funerals
and
weddings
.
in
the
uk
,
the
government
has
shut
schools
,
pubs
,
restaurants
,
bars
,
cafés
and
all
non-essential
shops
for
at
least
nine
weeks

boris

outlined
a
flexible
plan
that
would
see
some
schools
reopen
by
june
depending
on
the
current
threat
posed
to
the
uk
by
the
virus.on
march
23
,
prime
minister
boris
johnson
put
the
uk
under
lockdown
saying
that
police
will
now
have
the
power
to
fine
people
who
gather
in
groups
of
more
than
two
or
who
are
outside
for
non-essential
reasons
.
people
with
the
main
coronavirus
symptoms
–
a
fever
or
dry

–
are
required
to
stay
at
home
for
seven
days
while
households
in
which
at
least
one
person
is
displaying
symptoms
should
quarantine
themselves
for
14
days
.
four
days
later
the
prime

and
health

both
tested
positive
for

officially
declared
the
covid-19

a

``
who
has
been
assessing
this
outbreak
around
the
clock
and
we
are
deeply
concerned
both
by
the
alarming
levels
of
spread
and
severity
,
and
by
the
alarming
levels
of
inaction
,
''
said
its
director-general
tedros
adhanom
ghebreyesus
.
although
the
who
designated
covid-19
a
``
public
health
emergency
of
international
concern
''
(
pheic
)
on
january
30
,
it
had
been
reluctant
to
call
it
a
pandemic
.
``
pandemic
is
not
a
word
to
use
lightly
or
carelessly
.
it
is
a
word
that
,
if
misused
,
can
cause
unreasonable
fear
,
or
unjustified
acceptance
that
the
fight
is
over
,
leading
to
unnecessary
suffering
and
death
,
''
adhanom
said.a
quick
note
on
naming
.
although
popularly
referred
to
as
coronavirus
,
on
february
11
,
the
who
announced
the
official
name
of
the
disease
:
covid-19
.
the
virus
that
causes
that
disease
is
called
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
2
,
or
sars-cov-2
for
short.the
disease
appears
to
have
originated
from
a
wuhan
seafood
market
where
wild
animals
,
including
marmots
,
birds
,
rabbits
,
bats
and
snakes
,
are
traded
illegally
.
coronaviruses
are
known
to
jump
from
animals
to
humans
,
so
it
’
s
thought
that
the
first
people
infected
with
the
disease
–
a
group
primarily
made
up
of
stallholders
from
the
seafood
market
–
contracted
it
from
contact
with
animals.the
hunt
for
the
animal
source
of
covid-19
is
still
unknown
,
although
there
are
some
strong
contenders
.
a
team
of
virologists
at
the
wuhan
institute
for
virology
released
a
detailed
paper
showing
that
the
new
coronaviruses
'
genetic
makeup
is
96
per
cent
identical
to
that
of
a
coronavirus
found
in
bats
,
while
a
study
published
on
march
26
argues
that
genetic
sequences
of
coronavirus
in
pangolins
are
between
88.5
and
92.4
per
cent
similar
to
the
human
virus
.
some
early
cases
of
covid-19
,
however
,
appear
to
have
inflicted
people
with
no
link
to
the
wuhan
market
at
all
,
suggesting
that
the
initial
route
of
human
infection
may
pre-date
the
market
cases.the
wuhan
market
was
shut
down
for
inspection
and
cleaning
on
january
1
,
but
by
then
it
appears
that
covid-19
was
already
starting
to
spread
beyond
the
market
itself
.
on
january
21
,
the
who
western
pacific
office
said
the
disease
was
also
being
transmitted
between
humans
–
evidence
of
which
is
apparent
after
medical
staff
became
infected
with
the
virus.coronaviruses
are
a
large
group
of
viruses
that
are
known
to
infect
both
humans
and
animals
,
and
in
humans
cause
respiratory
illness
that
range
from
common
colds
to
much
more
serious
infections
.
the
most
well-known
case
of
a
coronavirus
epidemic
was
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
(
sars
)
,
which
,
after
first
being
detected
in
southern
china
in
2002
,
went
on
to
affect
26
countries
and
resulted
in
more
than
8,000
cases
and
774
deaths.while
the
cause
of
the
current
outbreak
was
initially
unknown
,
on
january
7
chinese
health
authorities
identified
that
it
was
caused
by
to
a
strain
of
coronavirus
that
hadn
’
t
been
encountered
in
humans
before
.
five
days
later
the
chinese
government
shared
the
genetic
sequence
of
the
virus
so
that
other
countries
could
develop
their
own
diagnostic
kits
.
that
virus
is
now
called
sars-cov-2.although
symptoms
of
coronaviruses
are
often
mild
–
the
most
common
symptoms
are
a
fever
and
dry
cough
–
in
some
cases
they
lead
to
more
serious
respiratory
tract
illness
including
pneumonia
and
bronchitis
.
these
can
be
particularly
dangerous
in
older
patients
,
or
people
who
have
existing
health
conditions
,
and
this
appears
to
be
the
case
with
covid-19
.
a
study
of
44,415
early
chinese
covid-19
patients
found
that
81
per
cent
of
people
with
confirmed
infections
experienced
only
mild
symptoms
.
of
the
remaining
cases
,
14
per
cent
were
in
a
severe
condition
while
five
per
cent
of
people
were
critical
cases
,
suffering
from
respiratory
failure
,
septic
shock
or
multiple
organ
failure
.
in
the
chinese
study
,
2.3
per
cent
of
all
confirmed
cases
died
,
although
the
actual
death
rate
is
probably
much
lower
as
many
more
people
will
have
been
infected
with
the
virus
than
tested
positive.china
felt
the
initial
brunt
of
the
covid-19
epidemic
.
at
the
peak
of
its
outbreak
in
mid-february
,
the
country
saw
more
than
5,000
cases
in
a
single
day
.
as
of
may
27
,
chinese
health
authorities
had
acknowledged
over
84,103
cases
and
4,638
deaths
–
most
of
them
within
the
province
of
hubei
.
since
march
,
however
,
the
country
has
seen
a
remarkable
slowdown
.
on
march
17
,
china
recorded
just
39
new
cases
of
the
virus
.
most
of
the
country
's
new
cases
are
imported
from
elsewhere
in
the
world
–
for
now
at
least
,
it
appears
that
china
has
its
outbreak
under
control.but
while
things
were
slowing
down
in
china
,
the
outbreak
started
picking
up
in
the
rest
of
the
world
.
there
are
now
confirmed
cases
in
at
least
200
countries
and
territories
.
the
us
has
seen
the
highest
number
of
cases
.
the
country
–
which
has
been
criticised
for
its
slow
rollout
of
testing
and
confused
approach
to
the
crisis
–
now
has
1,681,418
confirmed
infections
and
98,929
deaths
.
with
370,680
confirmed
cases
and
3,807
deaths
,
russia
's
mortality
rate
appears
to
be
particularly
low
.
the
true
death
toll
may
be
underreported
because
the
country
's
statistics
only
include
the
deaths
of
people
directly
attributed
to
covid-19.after
the
uk
,
italy
has
seen
the
highest
number
of
deaths
in
europe
,
with
32,955
deaths
and
230,555
confirmed
infections
,
mostly
in
the
north
of
the

the

had
the
longest-running
lockdown
of
any
country

on

ratcheting-up
of

's

policies

the
ability
to
fine

who
do
not
comply
with
the
new
rules
,
the
prime
minister
said
in
his
address
to
the
nation
.
the
government
also
asked
uk
mobile
networks
to
send
a
message
to
everyone
in
the
uk
instructing
them
that
they
must
stay
at
home.people
who
currently
live
alone
are
recommended
to
self-isolate
for
seven
days
if
they
develop
a
fever
or
persistent
dry
cough
–
the
two
most
common
symptoms
of
coronavirus
.
for
families
and
other
people
who
live
together
,
the
advice
is
that
the
entire
household
should
self-isolate
if
any
member
develops
either
of
those
symptoms
.
this
strategy
is
part
of
the
government
's
'delay
phase
'
plan
to
flatten
the
peak
of
the
virus
and
reduce
the
burden
on
the
nhs.a
key
part
of
this
plan
is
shielding
those
who
are
most
vulnerable
to
covid-19
:
people
older
than
70
,
or
those
who
have
underlying
health
conditions
.
the
nhs
has
identified
the
1.5
million
people
most
vulnerable
and
sent
them
letters
instructing
them
to
self-isolate
for
12
weeks
.
these
people
are
being
asked
not
to
leave
their
houses
under
any
circumstances
,
to
minimise
all
face-to-face
contact
and
for
all
deliveries
of
food
and
medication
to
be
left
at
their
doorsteps.although
the
prime
minister
said
that
this
shielding
may
last
as
long
as
12
weeks
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
peak
of
the
outbreak
has
passed
,
modelling
from
imperial
college
london
suggests
that
these
measures
may
have
to
be
in
place
for
as
long
as
18
months
.
on
may
10
prime
minister
boris
johnson
announced
that
the
uk
lockdown
would
be
in
place
until
at
least
june
when
some
shops
and
schools
will
be
allowed
to
re-open.despite
these
measures
,
some
have
been
critical
that
the
government
's
stance
does
n't
go
far
enough
.
italy
and
spain
both
had
in
place
even
more
restrictive
lockdowns
,
while
south
korea
has
rolled-out
extremely
comprehensive
testing
for
many
of
its
population
.
the
government
has
also
been
ramping
up
antibody
tests
which
should
eventually
be
able
to
detect
who
has
been
previously
exposed
to
the
virus
,
although
there
are
serious
doubts
over
the
accuracy
of
the
currently
available
tests
.
the
first
1,000
samples
suggest
17
per
cent
of
adults
in
london
and
around
5
per
cent
across
england
have
coronavirus
antibodies.covid-19
shares
many
of
its
symptoms
with
the
flu
or
common
cold
,
although
there
are
certain
symptoms
common
to
flu
and
colds
that
are
not
usually
seen
in
covid-19
.
people
with
confirmed
cases
of
covid-19
rarely
suffer
from
a
runny
nose
,
for
instance.the
most
common

symptoms
are

of
55,924
early
chinese
cases
of

,
nearly
90
per
cent
of
patients
experienced
a
fever
and
just
over
two-thirds
suffered
with
a
dry

.
that
’
s
why
the
uk
government
is
advising
anyone
with
a
high
temperature
or
a
new
,
continuous
cough
to
stay
at
home
for
seven
days
or
,
if
they
live

for
the

to
isolate
for
14
days
from
the
first
onset
of

covid-19
symptoms
are
less
common

just
under
40
per

of

experience

,
while
a

of

cough
up

–
a
thick
mucus
from

other
rarer

include
shortness

pain
,
sore

.
according
to
the
who
,
symptoms
tend
to
appear
between
five
and
six
days
after
infection.a
vaccine
for
covid-19
isn
’
t
around
the
corner
.
bringing
vaccines
to
the
market
is
a
notoriously
slow
process
and
any
potential
vaccine
will
have
to
pass
multiple
stages
of
testing
for
safety
and
effectiveness
.
and
once

is
an
aerosol
scientist
at
virginia
tech
and
one
of
the
few
in
the
world
who
also
studies
infectious
diseases
.
to
her
,
the
new
coronavirus
looked
as
if
it
could
hang
in
the
air
,
infecting
anyone
who
breathed
in
enough
of
it
.
for
people
indoors
,
that
posed
a
considerable
risk
.
but
the
who
didn
’
t
seem
to
have
caught
on
.
just
days
before
,
the
organization
had
tweeted
“
fact
:
#
covid19
is
not
airborne.
”
that
’
s
why
marr
was
skipping
her
usual
morning
workout
to
join
35
other
aerosol
scientists
.
they
were
trying
to
warn
the
who
it
was
making
a
big
mistake.over
zoom
,
they
laid
out
the
case
.
they
ticked
through
a
growing
list
of
superspreading
events
in
restaurants
,
call
centers
,
cruise
ships
,
and
a
choir
rehearsal
,
instances
where
people
got
sick
even
when
they
were
across
the
room
from
a
contagious
person
.
the
incidents
contradicted
the
who
’
s
main
safety
guidelines
of
keeping
3
to
6
feet
of
distance
between
people
and
frequent
handwashing
.
if
sars-cov-2
traveled
only
in
large
droplets
that
immediately
fell
to
the
ground
,
as
the
who
was
saying
,
then
wouldn
’
t
the
distancing
and
the
handwashing
have
prevented
such
outbreaks
?
infectious
air
was
the
more
likely
culprit
,
they
argued
.
but
the
who
’
s
experts
appeared
to
be
unmoved
.
if
they
were
going
to
call
covid-19
airborne
,
they
wanted
more
direct
evidence—proof
,
which
could
take
months
to
gather
,
that
the
virus
was
abundant
in
the
air
.
meanwhile
,
thousands
of
people
were
falling
ill
every
day.on
the
video
call
,
tensions
rose
.
at
one
point
,
lidia
morawska
,
a
revered
atmospheric
physicist
who
had
arranged
the
meeting
,
tried
to
explain
how
far
infectious
particles
of
different
sizes
could
potentially
travel
.
one
of
the
who
experts
abruptly
cut
her
off
,
telling
her
she
was
wrong
,
marr
recalls
.
his
rudeness
shocked
her
.
“
you
just
don
’
t
argue
with
lidia
about
physics
,
”
she
says.morawska
had
spent
more
than
two
decades
advising
a
different
branch
of
the
who
on
the
impacts
of
air
pollution
.
when
it
came
to
flecks
of
soot
and
ash
belched
out
by
smokestacks
and
tailpipes
,
the
organization
readily
accepted
the
physics
she
was
describing—that
particles
of
many
sizes
can
hang
aloft
,
travel
far
,
and
be
inhaled
.
now
,
though
,
the
who
’
s
advisers
seemed
to
be
saying
those
same
laws
didn
’
t
apply
to
virus-laced
respiratory
particles
.
to
them
,
the
word
airborne
only
applied
to
particles
smaller
than
5
microns
.
trapped
in
their
group-specific
jargon
,
the
two
camps
on
zoom
literally
couldn
’
t
understand
one
another.when
the
call
ended
,
marr
sat
back
heavily
,
feeling
an
old
frustration
coiling
tighter
in
her
body
.
she
itched
to
go
for
a
run
,
to
pound
it
out
footfall
by
footfall
into
the
pavement
.
“
it
felt
like
they
had
already
made
up
their
minds
and
they
were
just
entertaining
us
,
”
she
recalls
.
marr
was
no
stranger
to
being
ignored
by
members
of
the
medical
establishment
.
often
seen
as
an
epistemic
trespasser
,
she
was
used
to
persevering
through
skepticism
and
outright
rejection
.
this
time
,
however
,
so
much
more
than
her
ego
was
at
stake
.
the
beginning
of
a
global
pandemic
was
a
terrible
time
to
get
into
a
fight
over
words
.
but
she
had
an
inkling
that
the
verbal
sparring
was
a
symptom
of
a
bigger
problem—that
outdated
science
was
underpinning
public
health
policy
.
she
had
to
get
through
to
them
.
but
first
,
she
had
to
crack
the
mystery
of
why
their
communication
was
failing
so
badly
.
marr
spent
the
first
many
years
of
her
career
studying
air
pollution
,
just
as
morawska
had
.
but
her
priorities
began
to
change
in
the
late
2000s
,
when
marr
sent
her
oldest
child
off
to
day
care
.
that
winter
,
she
noticed
how
waves
of
runny
noses
,
chest
colds
,
and
flu
swept
through
the
classrooms
,
despite
the
staff
’
s
rigorous
disinfection
routines
.
“
could
these
common
infections
actually
be
in
the
air
?
”
she
wondered
.
marr
picked
up
a
few
introductory
medical
textbooks
to
satisfy
her
curiosity
.
according
to
the
medical
canon
,
nearly
all
respiratory
infections
transmit
through
coughs
or
sneezes
:
whenever
a
sick
person
hacks
,
bacteria
and
viruses
spray
out
like
bullets
from
a
gun
,
quickly
falling
and
sticking
to
any
surface
within
a
blast
radius
of
3
to
6
feet
.
if
these
droplets
alight
on
a
nose
or
mouth
(
or
on
a
hand
that
then
touches
the
face
)
,
they
can
cause
an
infection
.
only
a
few
diseases
were
thought
to
break
this
droplet
rule
.
measles
and
tuberculosis
transmit
a
different
way
;
they
’
re
described
as
“
airborne.
”
those
pathogens
travel
inside
aerosols
,
microscopic
particles
that
can
stay
suspended
for
hours
and
travel
longer
distances
.
they
can
spread
when
contagious
people
simply
breathe.the
distinction
between
droplet
and
airborne
transmission
has
enormous
consequences
.
to
combat
droplets
,
a
leading
precaution
is
to
wash
hands
frequently
with
soap
and
water
.
to
fight
infectious
aerosols
,
the
air
itself
is
the
enemy
.
in
hospitals
,
that
means
expensive
isolation
wards
and
n95
masks
for
all
medical
staff.the
books
marr
flipped
through
drew
the
line
between
droplets
and
aerosols
at
5
microns
.
a
micron
is
a
unit
of
measurement
equal
to
one-millionth
of
a
meter
.
by
this
definition
,
any
infectious
particle
smaller
than
5
microns
in
diameter
is
an
aerosol
;
anything
bigger
is
a
droplet
.
the
more
she
looked
,
the
more
she
found
that
number
.
the
who
and
the
us
centers
for
disease
control
and
prevention
also
listed
5
microns
as
the
fulcrum
on
which
the
droplet-aerosol
dichotomy
toggled.there
was
just
one
literally
tiny
problem
:
“
the
physics
of
it
is
all
wrong
,
”
marr
says
.
that
much
seemed
obvious
to
her
from
everything
she
knew
about
how
things
move
through
air
.
reality
is
far
messier
,
with
particles
much
larger
than
5
microns
staying
afloat
and
behaving
like
aerosols
,
depending
on
heat
,
humidity
,
and
airspeed
.
“
i
’
d
see
the
wrong
number
over
and
over
again
,
and
i
just
found
that
disturbing
,
”
she
says
.
the
error
meant
that
the
medical
community
had
a
distorted
picture
of
how
people
might
get
sick
.
epidemiologists
have
long
observed
that
most
respiratory
bugs
require
close
contact
to
spread
.
yet
in
that
small
space
,
a
lot
can
happen
.
a
sick
person
might
cough
droplets
onto
your
face
,
emit
small
aerosols
that
you
inhale
,
or
shake
your
hand
,
which
you
then
use
to
rub
your
nose
.
any
one
of
those
mechanisms
might
transmit
the
virus
.
“
technically
,
it
’
s
very
hard
to
separate
them
and
see
which
one
is
causing
the
infection
,
”
marr
says
.
for
long-distance
infections
,
only
the
smallest
particles
could
be
to
blame
.
up
close
,
though
,
particles
of
all
sizes
were
in
play
.
yet
,
for
decades
,
droplets
were
seen
as
the
main
culprit.marr
decided
to
collect
some
data
of
her
own
.
installing
air
samplers
in
places
such
as
day
cares
and
airplanes
,
she
frequently
found
the
flu
virus
where
the
textbooks
said
it
shouldn
’
t
be—hiding
in
the
air
,
most
often
in
particles
small
enough
to
stay
aloft
for
hours
.
and
there
was
enough
of
it
to
make
people
sick.in
2011
,
this
should
have
been
major
news
.
instead
,
the
major
medical
journals
rejected
her
manuscript
.
even
as
she
ran
new
experiments
that
added
evidence
to
the
idea
that
influenza
was
infecting
people
via
aerosols
,
only
one
niche
publisher
,
the
journal
of
the
royal
society
interface
,
was
consistently
receptive
to
her
work
.
in
the
siloed
world
of
academia
,
aerosols
had
always
been
the
domain
of
engineers
and
physicists
,
and
pathogens
purely
a
medical
concern
;
marr
was
one
of
the
rare
people
who
tried
to
straddle
the
divide
.
“
i
was
definitely
fringe
,
”
she
says.thinking
it
might
help
her
overcome
this
resistance
,
she
’
d
try
from
time
to
time
to
figure
out
where
the
flawed
5-micron
figure
had
come
from
.
but
she
always
got
stuck
.
the
medical
textbooks
simply
stated
it
as
fact
,
without
a
citation
,
as
if
it
were
pulled
from
the
air
itself
.
eventually
she
got
tired
of
trying
,
her
research
and
life
moved
on
,
and
the
5-micron
mystery
faded
into
the
background
.
until
,
that
is
,
december
2019
,
when
a
paper
crossed
her
desk
from
the
lab
of
yuguo
li.an
indoor-air
researcher
at
the
university
of
hong
kong
,
li
had
made
a
name
for
himself
during
the
first
sars
outbreak
,
in
2003
.
his
investigation
of
an
outbreak
at
the
amoy
gardens
apartment
complex
provided
the
strongest
evidence
that
a
coronavirus
could
be
airborne
.
but
in
the
intervening
decades
,
he
’
d
also
struggled
to
convince
the
public
health
community
that
their
risk
calculus
was
off
.
eventually
,
he
decided
to
work
out
the
math
.
li
’
s
elegant
simulations
showed
that
when
a
person
coughed
or
sneezed
,
the
heavy
droplets
were
too
few
and
the
targets—an
open
mouth
,
nostrils
,
eyes—too
small
to
account
for
much
infection
.
li
’
s
team
had
concluded
,
therefore
,
that
the
public
health
establishment
had
it
backward
and
that
most
colds
,
flu
,
and
other
respiratory
illnesses
must
spread
through
aerosols
instead
.
their
findings
,
they
argued
,
exposed
the
fallacy
of
the
5-micron
boundary
.
and
they
’
d
gone
a
step
further
,
tracing
the
number
back
to
a
decades-old
document
the
cdc
had
published
for
hospitals
.
marr
couldn
’
t
help
but
feel
a
surge
of
excitement
.
a
journal
had
asked
her
to
review
li
’
s
paper
,
and
she
didn
’
t
mask
her
feelings
as
she
sketched
out
her
reply
.
on
january
22
,
2020
,
she
wrote
,
“
this
work
is
hugely
important
in
challenging
the
existing
dogma
about
how
infectious
disease
is
transmitted
in
droplets
and
aerosols.
”
even
as
she
composed
her
note
,
the
implications
of
li
’
s
work
were
far
from
theoretical
.
hours
later
,
chinese
government
officials
cut
off
any
travel
in
and
out
of
the
city
of
wuhan
,
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
contain
an
as-yet-unnamed
respiratory
disease
burning
through
the
11-million-person
megalopolis
.
as
the
pandemic
shut
down
country
after
country
,
the
who
and
the
cdc
told
people
to
wash
their
hands
,
scrub
surfaces
,
and
maintain
social
distance
.
they
didn
’
t
say
anything
about
masks
or
the
dangers
of
being
indoors
.
a
few
days
after
the
april
zoom
meeting
with
the
who
,
marr
got
an
email
from
another
aerosol
scientist
who
had
been
on
the
call
,
an
atmospheric
chemist
at
the
university
of
colorado
boulder
named
jose-luis
jimenez
.
he
’
d
become
fixated
on
the
who
recommendation
that
people
stay
3
to
6
feet
apart
from
one
another
.
as
far
as
he
could
tell
,
that
social
distancing
guideline
seemed
to
be
based
on
a
few
studies
from
the
1930s
and
’
40s
.
but
the
authors
of
those
experiments
actually
argued
for
the
possibility
of
airborne
transmission
,
which
by
definition
would
involve
distances
over
6
feet
.
none
of
it
seemed
to
add
up
.
marr
told
him
about
her
concerns
with
the
5-micron
boundary
and
suggested
that
their
two
issues
might
be
linked
.
if
the
6-foot
guideline
was
built
off
of
an
incorrect
definition
of
droplets
,
the
5-micron
error
wasn
’
t
just
some
arcane
detail
.
it
seemed
to
sit
at
the
heart
of
the
who
’
s
and
the
cdc
’
s
flawed
guidance
.
finding
its
origin
suddenly
became
a
priority
.
but
to
hunt
it
down
,
marr
,
jimenez
,
and
their
collaborators
needed
help
.
they
needed
a
historian.luckily
,
marr
knew
one
,
a
virginia
tech
scholar
named
tom
ewing
who
specialized
in
the
history
of
tuberculosis
and
influenza
.
they
talked
.
he
suggested
they
bring
on
board
a
graduate
student
he
happened
to
know
who
was
good
at
this
particular
form
of
forensics
.
the
team
agreed
.
“
this
will
be
very
interesting
,
”
marr
wrote
in
an
email
to
jimenez
on
april
13
.
“
i
think
we
’
re
going
to
find
a
house
of
cards.
”
the
graduate
student
in
question
was
katie
randall
.
covid
had
just
dealt
her
dissertation
a
big
blow—she
could
no
longer
conduct
in-person
research
,
so
she
’
d
promised
her
adviser
she
would
devote
the
spring
to
sorting
out
her
dissertation
and
nothing
else
.
but
then
an
email
from
ewing
arrived
in
her
inbox
describing
marr
’
s
quest
and
the
clues
her
team
had
so
far
unearthed
,
which
were
“
layered
like
an
archaeology
site
,
with
shards
that
might
make
up
a
pot
,
”
he
wrote
.
that
did
it
.
she
was
in.randall
had
studied
citation
tracking
,
a
type
of
scholastic
detective
work
where
the
clues
aren
’
t
blood
sprays
and
stray
fibers
but
buried
references
to
long-ago
studies
,
reports
,
and
other
records
.
she
started
digging
where
li
and
the
others
had
left
off—with
various
who
and
cdc
papers
.
but
she
didn
’
t
find
any
more
clues
than
they
had
.
dead
end.she
tried
another
tack
.
everyone
agreed
that
tuberculosis
was
airborne
.
so
she
plugged
“
5
microns
”
and
“
tuberculosis
”
into
a
search
of
the
cdc
’
s
archives
.
she
scrolled
and
scrolled
until
she
reached
the
earliest
document
on
tuberculosis
prevention
that
mentioned
aerosol
size
.
it
cited
an
out-of-print
book
written
by
a
harvard
engineer
named
william
firth
wells
.
published
in
1955
,
it
was
called
airborne
contagion
and
air
hygiene
.
a
lead
!
in
the
before
times
,
she
would
have
acquired
the
book
through
interlibrary
loan
.
with
the
pandemic
shutting
down
universities
,
that
was
no
longer
an
option
.
on
the
wilds
of
the
open
internet
,
randall
tracked
down
a
first
edition
from
a
rare
book
seller
for
$
500—a
hefty
expense
for
a
side
project
with
essentially
no
funding
.
but
then
one
of
the
university
’
s
librarians
came
through
and
located
a
digital
copy
in
michigan
.
randall
began
to
dig
in.in
the
words
of
wells
’
manuscript
,
she
found
a
man
at
the
end
of
his
career
,
rushing
to
contextualize
more
than
23
years
of
research
.
she
started
reading
his
early
work
,
including
one
of
the
studies
jimenez
had
mentioned
.
in
1934
,
wells
and
his
wife
,
mildred
weeks
wells
,
a
physician
,
analyzed
air
samples
and
plotted
a
curve
showing
how
the
opposing
forces
of
gravity
and
evaporation
acted
on
respiratory
particles
.
the
couple
’
s
calculations
made
it
possible
to
predict
the
time
it
would
take
a
particle
of
a
given
size
to
travel
from
someone
’
s
mouth
to
the
ground
.
according
to
them
,
particles
bigger
than
100
microns
sank
within
seconds
.
smaller
particles
stayed
in
the
air
.
randall
paused
at
the
curve
they
’
d
drawn
.
to
her
,
it
seemed
to
foreshadow
the
idea
of
a
droplet-aerosol
dichotomy
,
but
one
that
should
have
pivoted
around
100
microns
,
not
5
.
the
book
was
long
,
more
than
400
pages
,
and
randall
was
still
on
the
hook
for
her
dissertation
.
she
was
also
helping
her
restless
6-year-old
daughter
navigate
remote
kindergarten
,
now
that
covid
had
closed
her
school
.
so
it
was
often
not
until
late
at
night
,
after
everyone
had
gone
to
bed
,
that
she
could
return
to
it
,
taking
detailed
notes
about
each
day
’
s
progress.one
night
she
read
about
experiments
wells
did
in
the
1940s
in
which
he
installed
air-disinfecting
ultraviolet
lights
inside
schools
.
in
the
classrooms
with
uv
lamps
installed
,
fewer
kids
came
down
with
the
measles
.
he
concluded
that
the
measles
virus
must
have
been
in
the
air
.
randall
was
struck
by
this
.
she
knew
that
measles
didn
’
t
get
recognized
as
an
airborne
disease
until
decades
later
.
what
had
happened
?
part
of
medical
rhetoric
is
understanding
why
certain
ideas
take
hold
and
others
don
’
t
.
so
as
spring
turned
to
summer
,
randall
started
to
investigate
how
wells
’
contemporaries
perceived
him
.
that
’
s
how
she
found
the
writings
of
alexander
langmuir
,
the
influential
chief
epidemiologist
of
the
newly
established
cdc
.
like
his
peers
,
langmuir
had
been
brought
up
in
the
gospel
of
personal
cleanliness
,
an
obsession
that
made
handwashing
the
bedrock
of
us
public
health
policy
.
he
seemed
to
view
wells
’
ideas
about
airborne
transmission
as
retrograde
,
seeing
in
them
a
slide
back
toward
an
ancient
,
irrational
terror
of
bad
air—the
“
miasma
theory
”
that
had
prevailed
for
centuries
.
langmuir
dismissed
them
as
little
more
than
“
interesting
theoretical
points.
”
but
at
the
same
time
,
langmuir
was
growing
increasingly
preoccupied
by
the
threat
of
biological
warfare
.
he
worried
about
enemies
carpeting
us
cities
in
airborne
pathogens
.
in
march
1951
,
just
months
after
the
start
of
the
korean
war
,
langmuir
published
a
report
in
which
he
simultaneously
disparaged
wells
’
belief
in
airborne
infection
and
credited
his
work
as
being
foundational
to
understanding
the
physics
of
airborne
infection.how
curious
,
randall
thought
.
she
kept
reading.in
the
report
,
langmuir
cited
a
few
studies
from
the
1940s
looking
at
the
health
hazards
of
working
in
mines
and
factories
,
which
showed
the
mucus
of
the
nose
and
throat
to
be
exceptionally
good
at
filtering
out
particles
bigger
than
5
microns
.
the
smaller
ones
,
however
,
could
slip
deep
into
the
lungs
and
cause
irreversible
damage
.
if
someone
wanted
to
turn
a
rare
and
nasty
pathogen
into
a
potent
agent
of
mass
infection
,
langmuir
wrote
,
the
thing
to
do
would
be
to
formulate
it
into
a
liquid
that
could
be
aerosolized
into
particles
smaller
than
5
microns
,
small
enough
to
bypass
the
body
’
s
main
defenses
.
curious
indeed
.
randall
made
a
note.when
she
returned
to
wells
’
book
a
few
days
later
,
she
noticed
he
too
had
written
about
those
industrial
hygiene
studies
.
they
had
inspired
wells
to
investigate
what
role
particle
size
played
in
the
likelihood
of
natural
respiratory
infections
.
he
designed
a
study
using
tuberculosis-causing
bacteria
.
the
bug
was
hardy
and
could
be
aerosolized
,
and
if
it
landed
in
the
lungs
,
it
grew
into
a
small
lesion
.
he
exposed
rabbits
to
similar
doses
of
the
bacteria
,
pumped
into
their
chambers
either
as
a
fine
(
smaller
than
5
microns
)
or
coarse
(
bigger
than
5
microns
)
mist
.
the
animals
that
got
the
fine
treatment
fell
ill
,
and
upon
autopsy
it
was
clear
their
lungs
bulged
with
lesions
.
the
bunnies
that
received
the
coarse
blast
appeared
no
worse
for
the
wear.for
days
,
randall
worked
like
this—going
back
and
forth
between
wells
and
langmuir
,
moving
forward
and
backward
in
time
.
as
she
got
into
langmuir
’
s
later
writings
,
she
observed
a
shift
in
his
tone
.
in
articles
he
wrote
up
until
the
1980s
,
toward
the
end
of
his
career
,
he
admitted
he
had
been
wrong
about
airborne
infection
.
it
was
possible.a
big
part
of
what
changed
langmuir
’
s
mind
was
one
of
wells
’
final
studies
.
working
at
a
va
hospital
in
baltimore
,
wells
and
his
collaborators
had
pumped
exhaust
air
from
a
tuberculosis
ward
into
the
cages
of
about
150
guinea
pigs
on
the
building
’
s
top
floor
.
month
after
month
,
a
few
guinea
pigs
came
down
with
tuberculosis
.
still
,
public
health
authorities
were
skeptical
.
they
complained
that
the
experiment
lacked
controls
.
so
wells
’
team
added
another
150
animals
,
but
this
time
they
included
uv
lights
to
kill
any
germs
in
the
air
.
those
guinea
pigs
stayed
healthy
.
that
was
it
,
the
first
incontrovertible
evidence
that
a
human
disease—tuberculosis—could
be
airborne
,
and
not
even
the
public
health
big
hats
could
ignore
it
.
the
groundbreaking
results
were
published
in
1962
.
wells
died
in
september
of
the
following
year
.
a
month
later
,
langmuir
mentioned
the
late
engineer
in
a
speech
to
public
health
workers
.
it
was
wells
,
he
said
,
that
they
had
to
thank
for
illuminating
their
inadequate
response
to
a
growing
epidemic
of
tuberculosis
.
he
emphasized
that
the
problematic
particles—the
ones
they
had
to
worry
about—were
smaller
than
5
microns.inside
randall
’
s
head
,
something
snapped
into
place
.
she
shot
forward
in
time
,
to
that
first
tuberculosis
guidance
document
where
she
had
started
her
investigation
.
she
had
learned
from
it
that
tuberculosis
is
a
curious
critter
;
it
can
only
invade
a
subset
of
human
cells
in
the
deepest
reaches
of
the
lungs
.
most
bugs
are
more
promiscuous
.
they
can
embed
in
particles
of
any
size
and
infect
cells
all
along
the
respiratory
tract.what
must
have
happened
,
she
thought
,
was
that
after
wells
died
,
scientists
inside
the
cdc
conflated
his
observations
.
they
plucked
the
size
of
the
particle
that
transmits
tuberculosis
out
of
context
,
making
5
microns
stand
in
for
a
general
definition
of
airborne
spread
.
wells
’
100-micron
threshold
got
left
behind
.
“
you
can
see
that
the
idea
of
what
is
respirable
,
what
stays
airborne
,
and
what
is
infectious
are
all
being
flattened
into
this
5-micron
phenomenon
,
”
randall
says
.
over
time
,
through
blind
repetition
,
the
error
sank
deeper
into
the
medical
canon
.
the
cdc
did
not
respond
to
multiple
requests
for
comment
.
in
june
,
she
zoomed
into
a
meeting
with
the
rest
of
the
team
to
share
what
she
had
found
.
marr
almost
couldn
’
t
believe
someone
had
cracked
it
.
“
it
was
like
,
‘
oh
my
gosh
,
this
is
where
the
5
microns
came
from
?
!
’
”
after
all
these
years
,
she
finally
had
an
answer
.
but
getting
to
the
bottom
of
the
5-micron
myth
was
only
the
first
step
.
dislodging
it
from
decades
of
public
health
doctrine
would
mean
convincing
two
of
the
world
’
s
most
powerful
health
authorities
not
only
that
they
were
wrong
but
that
the
error
was
incredibly—and
urgently—consequential.while
randall
was
digging
through
the
past
,
her
collaborators
were
planning
a
campaign
.
in
july
,
marr
and
jimenez
went
public
,
signing
their
names
to
an
open
letter
addressed
to
public
health
authorities
,
including
the
who
.
along
with
237
other
scientists
and
physicians
,
they
warned
that
without
stronger
recommendations
for
masking
and
ventilation
,
airborne
spread
of
sars-cov-2
would
undermine
even
the
most
vigorous
testing
,
tracing
,
and
social
distancing
efforts
.
the
news
made
headlines
.
and
it
provoked
a
strong
backlash
.
prominent
public
health
personalities
rushed
to
defend
the
who
.
twitter
fights
ensued
.
saskia
popescu
,
an
infection-prevention
epidemiologist
who
is
now
a
biodefense
professor
at
george
mason
university
,
was
willing
to
buy
the
idea
that
people
were
getting
covid
by
breathing
in
aerosols
,
but
only
at
close
range
.
that
’
s
not
airborne
in
the
way
public
health
people
use
the
word
.
“
it
’
s
a
very
weighted
term
that
changes
how
we
approach
things
,
”
she
says
.
“
it
’
s
not
something
you
can
toss
around
haphazardly.
”
days
later
,
the
who
released
an
updated
scientific
brief
,
acknowledging
that
aerosols
couldn
’
t
be
ruled
out
,
especially
in
poorly
ventilated
places
.
but
it
stuck
to
the
3-
to
6-foot
rule
,
advising
people
to
wear
masks
indoors
only
if
they
couldn
’
t
keep
that
distance
.
jimenez
was
incensed
.
“
it
is
misinformation
,
and
it
is
making
it
difficult
for
ppl
to
protect
themselves
,
”
he
tweeted
about
the
update
.
“
e.g
.
50+
reports
of
schools
,
offices
forbidding
portable
hepa
units
because
of
@
cdcgov
and
@
who
downplaying
aerosols.
”
while
jimenez
and
others
sparred
on
social
media
,
marr
worked
behind
the
scenes
to
raise
awareness
of
the
misunderstandings
around
aerosols
.
she
started
talking
to
kimberly
prather
,
an
atmospheric
chemist
at
uc
san
diego
,
who
had
the
ear
of
prominent
public
health
leaders
within
the
cdc
and
on
the
white
house
covid
task
force
.
in
july
,
the
two
women
sent
slides
to
anthony
fauci
,
director
of
the
national
institutes
of
allergy
and
infectious
diseases
.
one
of
them
showed
the
trajectory
of
a
5-micron
particle
released
from
the
height
of
the
average
person
’
s
mouth
.
it
went
farther
than
6
feet—hundreds
of
feet
farther
.
a
few
weeks
later
,
speaking
to
an
audience
at
harvard
medical
school
,
fauci
admitted
that
the
5-micron
distinction
was
wrong—and
had
been
for
years
.
“
bottom
line
is
,
there
is
much
more
aerosol
than
we
thought
,
”
he
said
.
(
fauci
declined
to
be
interviewed
for
this
story
.
)
still
,
the
droplet
dogma
reigned
.
in
early
october
,
marr
and
a
group
of
scientists
and
doctors
published
a
letter
in
science
urging
everyone
to
get
on
the
same
page
about
how
infectious
particles
move
,
starting
with
ditching
the
5-micron
threshold
.
only
then
could
they
provide
clear
and
effective
advice
to
the
public
.
that
same
day
,
the
cdc
updated
its
guidance
to
acknowledge
that
sars-cov-2
can
spread
through
long-lingering
aerosols
.
but
it
didn
’
t
emphasize
them.that
winter
,
the
who
also
began
to
talk
more
publicly
about
aerosols
.
on
december
1
,
the
organization
finally
recommended
that
everyone
always
wear
a
mask
indoors
wherever
covid-19
is
spreading
.
in
an
interview
,
the
who
’
s
maria
van
kerkhove
said
that
the
change
reflects
the
organization
’
s
commitment
to
evolving
its
guidance
when
the
scientific
evidence
compels
a
change
.
she
maintains
that
the
who
has
paid
attention
to
airborne
transmission
from
the
beginning—first
in
hospitals
,
then
at
places
such
as
bars
and
restaurants
.
“
the
reason
we
’
re
promoting
ventilation
is
that
this
virus
can
be
airborne
,
”
van
kerkhove
says
.
but
because
that
term
has
a
specific
meaning
in
the
medical
community
,
she
admits
to
avoiding
it—and
emphasizing
instead
the
types
of
settings
that
pose
the
biggest
risks
.
does
she
think
that
decision
has
harmed
the
public
health
response
,
or
cost
lives
?
no
,
she
says
.
“
people
know
what
they
need
to
do
to
protect
themselves.
”
yet
she
admits
it
may
be
time
to
rethink
the
old
droplet-airborne
dichotomy
.
according
to
van
kerkhove
,
the
who
plans
to
formally
review
its
definitions
for
describing
disease
transmission
in
2021
.
for
yuguo
li
,
whose
work
had
so
inspired
marr
,
these
moves
have
given
him
a
sliver
of
hope
.
“
tragedy
always
teaches
us
something
,
”
he
says
.
the
lesson
he
thinks
people
are
finally
starting
to
learn
is
that
airborne
transmission
is
both
more
complicated
and
less
scary
than
once
believed
.
sars-cov-2
,
like
many
respiratory
diseases
,
is
airborne
,
but
not
wildly
so
.
it
isn
’
t
like
measles
,
which
is
so
contagious
it
infects
90
percent
of
susceptible
people
exposed
to
someone
with
the
virus
.
and
the
evidence
hasn
’
t
shown
that
the
coronavirus
often
infects
people
over
long
distances
.
or
in
well-ventilated
spaces
.
the
virus
spreads
most
effectively
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
a
contagious
person
,
which
is
to
say
that
most
of
the
time
it
looks
an
awful
lot
like
a
textbook
droplet-based
pathogen
.
for
most
respiratory
diseases
,
not
knowing
which
route
caused
an
infection
has
not
been
catastrophic
.
but
the
cost
has
not
been
zero
.
influenza
infects
millions
each
year
,
killing
between
300,000
and
650,000
globally
.
and
epidemiologists
are
predicting
the
next
few
years
will
bring
particularly
deadly
flu
seasons
.
li
hopes
that
acknowledging
this
history—and
how
it
hindered
an
effective
global
response
to
covid-19—will
allow
good
ventilation
to
emerge
as
a
central
pillar
of
public
health
policy
,
a
development
that
would
not
just
hasten
the
end
of
this
pandemic
but
beat
back
future
ones
.
to
get
a
glimpse
into
that
future
,
you
need
only
peek
into
the
classrooms
where
li
teaches
or
the
crossfit
gym
where
marr
jumps
boxes
and
slams
medicine
balls
.
in
the
earliest
days
of
the
pandemic
,
li
convinced
the
administrators
at
the
university
of
hong
kong
to
spend
most
of
its
covid-19
budget
on
upgrading
the
ventilation
in
buildings
and
buses
rather
than
on
things
such
as
mass
covid
testing
of
students
.
marr
reviewed
blueprints
and
hvac
schematics
with
the
owner
of
her
gym
,
calculating
the
ventilation
rates
and
consulting
on
a
redesign
that
moved
workout
stations
outside
and
near
doors
that
were
kept
permanently
open
.
to
date
,
no
one
has
caught
covid
at
the
gym
.
li

recorded
a
total
of
23
covid-19
cases

of

marr

small

and
the
university
benefited
from
the
fact
that
asian
countries
,
scarred
by
the
2003
sars
epidemic
,
were
quick
to
recognize
aerosol
transmission
.
but
marr

and
li

swift

have

their

now
states
that

posted
their
paper
on
the
origins
of
the
5-micron
error
to
a
public
preprint
server
.
in
early
may
,
the
cdc
made
similar
changes
to
its
covid-19
guidance
,
now
placing
the

of
aerosols
at

of

the

organization—is
spreading
rapidly
around
the
globe
,

in

it
is
estimated
to
be
even
more
contagious
than
the
worrisome
b.1.1.7
variant
first
seen
in
the
uk
.
that

is
estimated
to
be
about
50
percent
more
transmissible
than
the
original
coronavirus
that
mushroomed
out

,
at

.
delta
is
estimated
to
be
50
to
60
percent
more
contagious
than
alpha.in
the
uk
,
infections
with
the
delta
variant
began
popping
up
at
very
low
levels
in
early
april
and
then
rose
swiftly
.
by
early
june
,
the
delta
variant
was
accounting
for
more
than
60
percent
of
cases.earlier
this
year
,
alpha
out-spread
other
versions
of
the
virus
to
become
the
predominant
strain
in
the
us
.
now
,
experts
expect
delta
will
take
its
place
,
just
as
it
did
in
the
uk
.
the
us
centers
for
disease
control
and
prevention
on
monday
officially
dubbed
delta
a
``
variant
of
concern
.
``
``
right
now
,
in
the
united
states
,
[
delta
accounts
for
]
about
10
percent
of
infections
.
it
's
doubling
every
two
weeks
,
''
said
scott
gottlieb
,
former
commissioner
of
the
food
and
drug
administration
,
sunday
on
face
the
nation
.
``
so
it
’
s
probably
going
to
become
the
dominant
strain
here
in
the
united
states
.
that
does
n't
mean
that
we
're
going
to
see
a
sharp
uptick
in
infections
,
but
it
does
mean
that
this
is
going
to
take
over
.
and
i
think
the
risk
is
really
to
the
fall—that
this
could
spike
a
new
epidemic
heading
into
the
fall
.
``
adding
to
the
worry
is
new
data
that
suggests
delta
may
also
cause
more
severe
disease—in
addition
to
spreading
to
more
people
.
early
findings
out
of
scotland
suggest
infections
with
the
delta
variant
were
associated
with
nearly
double
the
risk
of
infected
persons
ending
up
hospitalized
compared
to
infections
with
the
alpha
variant
.
the
data
was
published
monday
as
correspondence
in
the
lancet
.
experts
say
they
’
ll
need
more
data
to
confirm
that
risk.the
good
news
in
all
of
this
is
that
being
fully
vaccinated
appears
to
protect
against
delta
.
at
the
end
of
may
,
researchers
at
public
health
england
posted
data
(
which
had
not
been
peer-reviewed
)
indicating
that
two
doses
of
the
pfizer-biontech
vaccine
were
88
percent
effective
at
preventing
a
symptomatic
infection
with
the
delta
variant
.
meanwhile
,
the
data
said
,
two
doses
of
the
oxford-astrazeneca
vaccine
were
60
percent
effective
.
(
notably
,
just
one
shot
of
either
vaccine
was
not
protective
,
offering
only
33
percent
efficacy
against
symptomatic
delta
infections
.
experts
emphasized
the
importance
of
not
skipping
the
second
dose
.
)
data
out
of
scotland
on
monday
likewise
suggested
that
two
doses
of
the
pfizer-biontech
vaccine
were
79
percent
effective
against
the
delta
variant
,
while
two
doses
of
oxford-astrazeneca
vaccine
were
again
60
percent
effective.also
on
monday
,
phe
released
another
analysis
(
also
not

that
finds
that
two
doses
of
the
pfizer-biontech
vaccine
were
96
percent
effective
against
hospitalization
,
and
two
doses
of
the
oxford-astrazeneca

were
92
percent
effective
against

“
so
we
have
the
tools
to
control
this
and
defeat
it
,
”
gottlieb
noted.but
experts
are
still
concerned
.
the
pace
of
vaccination
has
slowed
significantly
in
the
us
,
and
many
states—particularly
in
the
south—are
far
behind
the
goal
of
getting
70
percent
of
adults
at
least
one
vaccine
.
pockets
of
low
vaccination
are
fueling
fears
among
experts
,
including
gottlieb
,
that
cases
could
once
again
spike
as
delta
continues
its
spread.peter
hotez
,
director
of
the
texas

echoed
that
concern
tuesday
.
he
told
cnn
that
he
is
“
extremely
worried
”
about
the
delta
variant
.
he
emphasized
that
right
now
is
“
crunch
time
”
to
get
fully
vaccinated—which
takes
five
to
six
weeks—before
delta
spreads
further.in
a
press
briefing
last
week
,
top
infectious
disease
expert
anthony
fauci
made
a
similar
plea
,
pointing
to
the
rapid
spread
of
the
delta
variant
in
the
uk
.
“
we
can
not
let
that
happen

this
“
is

powerful
argument

was
left
to

uninhibited
,
its
r
number
could
be
between
five
and
seven.for
mckee
,
it
seemed
inevitable
that
new
cases
of
covid-19
–
which
had
been
steadily
declining
since
early
january
–
would
begin
to
rise
again
.
on

not
seen
since

february
when
the
uk
was
still
in
full
lockdown.but
the
third
wave
will
look
very
different
to
the
last
two
.
while
the
delta
variant
is
considered
to
be
more
virulent
than
any
that
have
previously
followed
,
the
uk
’
s
successful
vaccination
campaign
appears
to
have
broken
the
seemingly
inevitable
link
between
cases
,
hospitalisations
,
and
fatalities
.
the
current
hospitalisation
rate
remains
low

there

johnson
’
s
government
is
currently
intending
to
end
all
restriction
measures
on
july
19
,
but
exactly
what
this
will
mean
for
new
cases
of
covid-19
,
and
public
health
,
is
almost
impossible
to
predict
,
due
to
the
varying
degrees
of
immunity
to
the
virus
in
the
population.
“
the
third
wave
will
be
different
in
characteristics
to
before
,
but
the
situation
is
so
complex
to
model
,
”
says
ravi
gupta
,
professor
of
clinical
microbiology
at
the
university
of
cambridge
.
“
you
have
lots
of
vaccinated
people
,
those
who
are
semi-immune
because
they
’
ve
already
been
infected
,
unvaccinated
people
,
and
a
lot
of
young
people.
”
in
addition
,
intensive
care
wards
report
a
very
fragmented
picture
across
the
uk
,
making
it
far
more
difficult
for
policymakers
to
form
a
coherent
strategy
.
while
the
third
wave
has
already
intensified
in
the
north
west
,
where
there
have
been
17,496
new
cases
over
the
last
seven
days
,
other
regions
are
still
seeing
relatively
little
transmission
.
“
where
we
are
,
it
’

fine
,
”
says
matt
morgan
,
consultant
in
intensive
care
medicine
at

hospital
of
wales
.
“
wales
is
doing
really
well
.
but
in
some
areas
in
the
north
and
the
west
midlands
,
you
can
see
this
scooped
out
curve
of
hospital
numbers
climbing
which
is
the
big
concern.
”
morgan
thinks
that
this
variation
between
regions
is
making
it
hard
for
the
public
,
mentally
fatigued
by
the
toll
of
repeated
lockdowns
,
to
accept
the
potential
threat
posed
by
the
third
wave
.
“
waves
one
and
two
were
a
case
of
,
‘
we
're
all
in
it
together
,
’
to
some
extent
,
”
he
says
.
“
it
’
s
not
like
that
now
,
and
it
’
s
really
hard
for
people
to
get
the
narrative
that
the
vaccination
campaign
has
gone
so
well
,
yet
there
’
s
still
an
ongoing
risk.
”
while
the
nhs
continues
to
vaccinate
the
population
with
remarkable
efficiency
–
as
of
june
22
,
64
per
cent
of
the
country
had
received
at
least
one
dose
of
the
vaccine
–
there
remains
a
proportion
of
people
who
are
not
protected
.
martin
landray
,
a
professor
of
medicine
and
epidemiology
at
the
university
of
oxford
,
points
out
that
there
will
be
a
percentage
of
elderly
individuals
who
have
not
mounted
a
full
immune
response
to
the
vaccine
,
while
the
effects
may
begin
to
wear
off
in
others
who
received
the
jab
in
the
early
months
of
the
campaign.last
week
,
nadhim
zahawi
,
minister
for
covid
vaccine
deployment
,
said
that
nine
out
of
ten
people
eligible
for
a
vaccine
had
accepted
one
.
however
landray
points
out
that
this
still
means
that
one
tenth
of
those
who
should
have
received
the
jab
remain
unvaccinated
.
“
either
they
did
n't
want
it
,
didn
’
t
turn
up
,
or
they
couldn
’
t
have
it
for
some
sort
of
medical
reason
.
everyone
thinks
that
the
older
age
groups
are
covered
,
but
we
will
still
have
some
problems
with
unvaccinated
people

fears
that
if
case
numbers
continue
to
climb
,
the
virus
will
eventually
reach
those
vulnerable
individuals
in
the
months
to
come
,
potentially
causing
a
new
spike
in
hospitalisations
.
one
of
the
problems
is
that
people
who
have
been
fully
vaccinated
may
still
be
capable
of
transmitting
the
delta
variant
to
some
extent
.
gupta
points
to
a
study
of
indian
healthcare
workers
,
which
showed
that
even
people
who
had
received
two
vaccine
doses
were
still
contributing
to
transmission
chains
within
hospitals
,
fueling
the
pandemic.as
a
result
,
mckee
believes
the
government
needs
to
look
at
vaccinating
teenagers
as
a
way
of
mitigating
the
threat
of
the
third
wave
to
the
old
and
vulnerable
.
“
this
needs
to
happen
at
the
absolute
minimum
,
”
says
mckee
.
“
the
joint
committee
on
vaccination
and
immunisation
is
looking
very
much
at
the
risks
and
benefits
to
children
themselves
,
but
we
have
a
long
tradition
in
countries
of
vaccinating
people
for
the
wider
benefit
.
we
vaccinate
children
against
influenza
partly
because
we
don
’
t
want
them
to
get
it
,
but
primarily
because
we
don
’
t
want
them
to
infect
their
grandparents.
”
a
lot
has
changed
since
the
first
wave
of
the
pandemics
.
doctors
do
have
an
array
of
new
options
at
their
disposal
to
fight
the
virus
.
over
the
past
year
,
the
uk
’
s
groundbreaking
recovery
trial
–
a
program
which
launched
in
march
2020
enrolling
tens
of
thousands
of
patients
at
dozens
of
hospitals
for
clinical
trials
investigating
covid-19
therapies
–
has
provided
vital
information
on
treatments
which
work
,
and
those
that
do
not
.
morgan
says
that
the
latter
information
is
just
as
important
,
as
it
has
helped
streamline
care
pathways
on
wards
and
in
intensive
care.as
a
result
,
convalescent
plasma
,
hydroxychloroquine
,
aspirin
,
colchicine
,
and
azithromycin
have
all
been
ruled
out
.
but
dexamethasone
,
tocilizumab
,
and
monoclonal
antibodies
–
artificial
antibodies
which
can
be
administered
to
elderly
or
immunosuppressed
patients
who
can
not
mount
an
immune
response
against
the
virus
,
via
an
intravenous
drip
–
have
been
shown
to
be
effective
life-saving
therapies.dexamethasone
and
tocilizumab
,
both
help
to
dampen
the
deadly
cytokine
storm
which
has
been
widely
touted
as
the
driving
force
behind
many
of
the
fatalities
from
covid-19
.
the
latter
treatment
has
only
been
available
from
december
2020
,
while
various
monoclonal
antibody
therapies
have
been
newly
approved
in
recent
weeks
as
a
result
of
new
data
from
the
recovery
study.at
the
same
time
,
the
information
we
now
have
about
some
of
the
longer
term
impacts
of
the
virus
,
especially
long
covid
which
has
impacted
younger
,
previously
healthy
women
particularly
hard
,
means
that
the
risk
posed
by
the
third
wave
can
not
only
be
assessed
in
terms
of
hospitalisations
and
deaths.accumulating
evidence
now
shows
that
sars-cov-2
can
persist
in
the
brain
as
a
chronic
infection
,
causing
structural
changes
,
and
inducing
a
higher
risk
of
strokes
,
muscle
disorders
,
dementia
,
and
psychiatric
disorders
,
even
among
non-hospitalised
patients.the
third
wave
will
almost
certainly
look
very
different
to
before
.
there
will
inevitably
be
fatalities
,
but
not
of
the
levels
of
the
previous
two
waves
.
as
a
result
,
some
doctors
feel
that
any
decisions
on
re-implementing
restrictions
in
the
months
to
come
are
likely
to
be
moral
and
ethical
questions
,
rather
than
medical
necessity.
“
i
think
wave
one
,
wave
two
,
it
was
clear
that
there
was
a
huge
emerging
wave
of
infections
and
hospitalisations
and
deaths
,
”
says
morgan
.
“
now
,
it
’
s
different
.
i
don
’
t
think
these
are
medical
decisions
anymore
,
they
are
ethical
,
moral
and
societal
decisions
,
and
they
have
to
be
answered
by
society
,
governments
,
and
ethical
institutions.

the
recurring
theme
was
how

is
helping
—
or

—
the
fight

,
the
coronavirus
that
has
given

of
the
global
response
to

,
an
issue
of
paramount
importance
in
the
context
of
the
pandemic.prof
.
larson
noted
that
according
to
her
and
her
colleagues
’

—
which
appears
in
the
lancet
—
“
people
’
s
feelings
about

have
become
far
more
volatile.
”
“
it
’
s
a
lot
more
like
political
opinion

.
they
used
to
be
much
more
stable
10–20
years
ago
.
you
knew
who
agreed
and
who
was
less
confident
around

,
but
that
’
s
changing
very
frequently

”
she
observed.however
,
she
did
offer
some
positive
news
:
“
the
overall
picture
is
that
[
…
]
there
is
a
general
trend
where
people
are
becoming
a
little
more
confident
[
about
vaccines
]
than
they
were
5
years
ago.
”
according
to
prof.
larson
,
this
may
be
because
public
health
specialists
and
communicators
are
more
proactive
in
dismantling
pervasive
myths
about
vaccination
over
the
past
few
years.nevertheless
,
she
cautioned
,
“
we
do
see
that
europe
remains
the
lowest
in
confidence
,
the
most
skeptical
,
with
countries
like

only
19
%

the
most
significant
drop
in
confidence
in

”
she
noted.she
also
emphasized
these
fluctuations
in
confidence
in
vaccines
across
the
globe
occurred
before
the
pandemic
.
in
the
current
situation
,
prof.
larson
said
,
sentiments
surrounding
vaccinations
have
become
even
more
volatile.
“
because
of
the
hyper-uncertainty
and
the
whole
environment
of
trust
and
distrust
around
the
covid
vaccine
,
there
are
groups
that
have
gotten
together
to
resist
even
the
covid
vaccine
,
”
she
warned.the
danger
of
anti-vaccination
mentalities
can
only
be
mitigated
by
giving
science
more
of
a
“
human
face
,
”
prof
larson
argued
:
“
we
need
to
bring
together
the
scientific
,
technological
advances
that
are
so
valuable
,
and
not
lose
the
human
face
,
but
bring
that
back
together
[
with
the
scientific
perspective

.
this
isn

t
just
a
misinformation
problem

this
is
a
relationship
problem
.
this
is
a
cultural
revolution

saying
‘
we
need
to
change

more
efficiently
:
“
i

the
crucial
thing

you
need
to

turnaround
time

have

widely
available

also
[

a

on
to
speak

the
innovations
that
rwandan
authorities
implemented
to
curb
the
spread
of
the
new
coronavirus
in
the
country.prof
.
binagwaho
said
that
the
first
step
was
to
identify
both
the
obstacles
and
facilitators
when
it
came
to
stopping
the
spread
of
sars-cov-2.according
to
the
expert
,
having
a
clear
idea
of
these
factors
allowed
the
authorities
to
establish
the
best
strategy
for
containing
the
spread
of
the
virus.most
importantly
,
however
,
according
to
prof.
binagwaho
,
rwandan
authorities
made
sure
to
keep
its
citizens
up-to-date
with
all
the
daily
news
regarding
the
local
spread
of
the
virus
—
both
good
and
bad.
“
[
w
]
hen
you
need
the
population
to
do
something
to
protect
itself
[
…
]
that
is
not
usual
,
trust
counts
more
than
money
,
”
she
commented.some
of
the
technological
innovations
that
the
country
implemented
during
the
pandemic
were
robots
that
take
people
’
s
temperatures
in
airports
and
hospitals
,
to
limit
human
contact
,
and
drones
that
carry

its
original
purpose
was
helping

understand
what
health
conditions
their
genetic
makeup
might
predispose
them
to
,
so
they
could
make
healthier
choices.at
wired
,
the
researcher
and
his
colleagues
said
that
they
adapted
this
technology
to
detect
covid-19
,
creating
tests
with
a
turnaround
time
of
only
90
minutes.in
the
u.k.
,
the
government
ordered
5.8
million
such
tests
for
state
hospitals.
“
effectively
,
it
took
a
pandemic
for
us
to
get
a
technology
that
’
s
[
…
]
prepared
for
personalized
medicine
into
the
hospital
system
.
so
the
only
way
that
we
could
‘
bulldoze
’
this
was
through
covid
,
”
prof.
toumazou
noted.the
researcher
emphasized
just
how
important
this
step
may
be
for
health
,
particularly
for
people
with
mental
health
conditions
,
who
would
not
have
to
anxiously
“
wait
for
48
hours
in
isolation
”
for
their
test
results.in
a
panel
discussion
,
dr.
indra
joshi
—
director
of
artificial
intelligence
at
nhsx
,
the
u.k.
governmental
unit
responsible
for
developing
national
health
policies
—
also
went
on
to
stress
that
advanced
technology
may
help
not
just
to
better
understand
the
pathology
of
covid-19
,
but
also
to
identify
the
people
who
are
most
at
risk.this
,
she
added
,
could
allow
healthcare
professionals
to
provide
help
faster
to
those
who
are
likely
to
be
the
most
affected
by
infection
with
the
new
coronavirus.in
dr.
joshi
’
s
view
,
advances
in
technology
could
therefore
offer
a
“
holistic
view
”
of
a
person
’
s
health
status
and
risks
,
beyond
diagnosing
covid-19.another
panel
discussion
focused
on
recent
developments
in
finding
a
vaccine
against
the
new
coronavirus.the
two
participants
were
tal
zaks
,
chief
medical
officer
of
moderna
therapeutics
,
and
prof.
uğur
şahin
,
co-founder
and
ceo
of
biontech.both
moderna
and
biontech
are
testing
mrna
candidate
vaccines
,
which
use
genetic
information
rather
than
a
viral
base
to
train
the
immune
system
against
the
new
coronavirus.speaking
of
the
advantages
of
an
mrna
vaccine
versus
other
forms
of
vaccines
,
zaks
said
that
“
it
is
better
in
a
number
of
fundamental
ways.
”
“
the
first
is
that
because
we
start
with
genetic
information
,
there
is
a
component
of
speed
that
allows
you
to
get
into
the
clinic
and
then
,
once
you
’
re
in
the
clinic
,
scale-up
manufacturing
.
it
’
s
not
by
chance
that
the
two
leading
efforts
both
leverage
mrna
technologies
,
”
he
pointed
out.
“
i
think
the
second
one
[
…
]
is
the
biological
preciseness
—
so
,
when
you
make
a
recombinant
protein
,
or
you
otherwise
characterize
a
biologic
,
the
process
makes
a
lot
of
difference
and
a
lot
of
things
can
go
wrong
.
when
you
’
re
transmitting
the
[
genetic
]
information
,
there
’
s
no
way
for
the
cell
to
make
the
wrong
bit
.
so
the
biological
fidelity
,
if
you
will
,
has
a
higher
likelihood
to
then
translate
into
the
kind
of
immune
response
you
want.
”
–
tal
zaks
“
i
think
the
last
element
here
is
it
’
s
a
very
flexible
platform
,
and
this
takes
us
a
little
bit
beyond
covid
,
but
the
infrastructure
required
is
relatively
small
and
quick
,
which
means
,
in
the
manufacturing
space
,
you
have
tremendous
agility
that
usual
technologies
don
’
t
,
”
zaks
added.at
the
time
of
the
wired
conference
,
clinical
trials
for
the
moderna
and
biontech
candidate
vaccines
were
at
similar
stages
.
since
the
two
approaches
have
similar
premises
,
the
question
arises
:
does
this
create
a
sense
of
competition
between
the
two
companies
?
according
to
zaks
,
in
the
context
of
a
pandemic
,
this
is
not
a
valid
question
.
“
i
only
have
two
competitors
here
:
the
virus
and
the
clock
,
”
he
asserted.he
added
that
should
both
the
moderna
and
the
biontech
candidate
vaccines
demonstrate
safety
and
efficacy
,
this
would
be
an
ideal
situation.
“
the
world
needs
more
than
one
company
to
succeed
here
,
”
he
said
,
noting
that
,
if
the
virus
is
truly
here
to
stay
,
as
previous
research
suggests
,
more
than
one
vaccine
may
become
necessary
in
the
long
run.prof
.
şahin
agreed
:
“
the
way
[
in
which
]
the
whole
industry
developed
vaccines
against
covid-19
[
…
]
is
the
best
performance
of
collaboration
.
it
’
s
important
to
see
how
people
team
up
for
collaboration

up

we
teamed
up

.
so
there
are
several
models
of
collaboration

and
we
have
the
strongest
transparency
in
the
development
of
a
vaccine.
”
“

see
the

in

explained
that

—
not
a

”
he
explained.
“
this
is
based
on
minimizing
the

also
based

it

about
using

to
make
medicine
“
more
humanistic.
”
“
the
main
objective
of
ai
for

has
been
to
improve
accuracy
,
”
so
that
doctors
can
improve
how
they
diagnose

and
care
for
their
patients
,
he
observed.this
is
what
is
known
as
“
precision
medicine.
”
but
dr.
topol
believes
that
using
ai
in
medical
practice
could
bring
about
more
“
far-reaching
benefits.
”
this
could
include
freeing
healthcare
practitioners
from
tasks
,
such
as
filing
information
about
their
patients
into
digital
systems
,
so
that
they
can
pay
more
attention
to
their
patients.
“
medicine
has
eroded
terribly
—
it
’
s
a
rushed
job
,
”
dr.
topol
asserted
in
his
talk
.
“
we
see
patients
in
a
single-digit
number
of
minutes
,
and
that
’
s
not
enough.
”
“
you
need
the
gift
of
time
,
which
ai
can
give
back
so
that
people
don
’
t
feel
so
rushed
and
doctors
and
nurses
and
clinicians
don
’
t
feel
so
rushed
either
.
[

we
want
to
have

dr.

a

argument
,
stressing
that
so
many
people
are
affected

in

that
specialists

often
overwhelmed
by
the
sheer
amount
of

waiting
for

“
some

are
essentially
going
blind
because
they
can
not
be
seen

treated

enough
,
”
dr.

“
new

by
surprise
.
the
country
was
designated
an
“
amber
”
destination
rather
than
“
green
,
”
meaning
that
travelers
would
need
to
quarantine
for
10
days
upon
their
return
to
the
uk
.
officials
said
this
switch
stemmed
in
part
from
concern
that
travelers
could
bring
more
variants
into
the
country
when
they
returned
home
.
this
decision
comes
shortly
after
the
uk
announced
it
would
launch
a
new
“
global
pandemic
radar
”
system
to
track
covid
variants
and
new
emerging
diseases
more
effectively.finding
activities
the
whole
family
will
enjoy
can
be
tough
,
especially
when
everyone
is
differently
abled

but
adaptive
game
controllers
are
making
it
possible
for
everyone
to
play
video
games
together

1970s
,
hewlett-packard
came
out
with
an
oximeter
that
would
now
be
considered
a
technological
dinosaur
.
but
in
many
ways
,
it
’
s
more
advanced
than
those
on
the
market
today
:
it
worked
equitably
,
regardless
of
skin
color
,

,
or

so
why
don

has
the

changed
the
homeschooling
community
in
the
us
?
last
fall
,
parents
across
the
country
who
were
sick
of
remote
learning
but
wary
of
sending
their
kids
back
into
classrooms
opted
to
take
classes
into
their
own
hands
.
now
some
plan
to
stick
with
it
even
after
the
pandemic
.
though
homeschoolers
in
america
have
stereotypically
been
white
and
isolationist
,
a
diverse
swath
of
families
took
the
opportunity
to
customize
their
kids
’
learning
in
the
last
year
,
often
with
the
help
of
tech
.
virtual
communities
,
especially
those
based
on
cultural
and
racial
groups
,
have
been
key
to
attracting
and
informing
a
broader
set
of
families
about
educating
their
own
kids.we
know
this
because
swabs
of
pulmonary
secretions
taken
from
the
eight
malaysians
during
their
illness
were
stored
as
part
of
a
screening
project
,
and
then
analyzed
last
year
by
a
duke
university
team
seeking
to
validate
a
new
test
.
what
they
found
,
and
described
two
weeks
ago
in
clinical
infectious
diseases
,
may
show
a
novel
coronavirus
in
the
process
of
leaping
from
the
animal
world
into
people
,
as
the
virus
that
causes
covid
probably
did
in
2019.that
new
virus
might
have
been
an
accidental
bystander
in
the
airways
of
those
malaysian
patients
,
whose
swabs
variously
also
turned
up
evidence
of
adenoviruses
,
rhinoviruses
or
flu
.
or
it
might
have
been
a
cause
of
their
disease
.
it
’
s
too
soon
to
know
.
(
to
be
clear
:
it
wasn
’
t
covid
.
canine
coronaviruses
and
the
viral
cause
of
covid
belong
to
separate
genera
of
the
coronavirus
family
.
)
nevertheless
,
researchers
in
the
world
of
emerging
infections
are
absolutely
sure
about
this
:
it
should
have
been
found
much
sooner
.
covid
is
supposed
to
have
demonstrated
that
we
need
faster
detection
.
that
a
possible
novel
pathogen
could
lie
concealed
in
a
lab
freezer
since
as
early
as
2017
shows
how
much
work
we
still
have
to
do.
“
a
novel
coronavirus
reached
human
populations
and
we
did
not
find
out
about
it
until

prime

said
his

built
on

at

is

in

,
the
first
independent

published
two

called

the

is
one
reason
why
the

instead
proposes
to
create
a
hub
for
aggregating
and
analyzing

rather
than
creating
a
new
one
.
there
hasn

been
much
detail
released
about
the
new
british
effort
,
but
there
are
indications
that
the
uk

is
thinking
along
similar
lines.the
effort
is
supported
by
the
philanthropic
wellcome
trust
,
and
in
concept
documents
,
that
organization
recommends
creating
a
super-hub

on

”
but
let
’
s
get
to
details
:
what
should
a
successful
system
do
?
if
the
world
is
going
to
have
a
new
detection
and
response
network—or
a
network
of
networks
,
or
a
super-network—some
decisions
need
to
be
made
about
its
scope
.
that
way
it
doesn
’
t
end
up
as
just
another
monitoring
system
,
but
has
the
power
to
pinpoint
areas
of
risk
and
to
spin
up
predictions
about
how
the
risk
might
play
out.caitlin
rivers
,
an
epidemiologist
and
senior
scholar
at
the
johns
hopkins
center
for
health
security
,
has
been
thinking
about
this
issue
for
more
than
a
decade
,
since
working
on
pandemic-prediction
initiatives
for
the
obama
administration
.
(
yes
,
better
pandemic
prediction
has
been
under
discussion
at
least
that
long
.
)
she
laid
out
details
last
year
in
a
proposal
for
a
national
center
for
epidemic
forecasting
,
published
in
foreign
affairs
,
with
dylan
george
of
the
intelligence-focused
venture
capital
firm
in-q-tel.they
wrote
that
pandemic
prediction
suffers
from
relying
on
academics
who
have
to
justify
their
research
to
grantmakers
,
and
who
can
’
t
necessarily
step
away
when
public
service
needs
their
expertise
.
the
authors
proposed
giving
disease
modelers
financial
support
to
work
out
their
models
in
advance
of
emergencies
,
and
creating
formal
channels
between
them
and
federal
decisionmakers
who
could
call
on
their
work
as
needed—similar
to
what
the
national
weather
service
already
does.rivers

and
george

proposal
was
read
by
the
right
people
.
five
days
after
president
joe
biden
’
s
inauguration
,
the
new
administration
committed
to
creating
a
national
center
for
epidemic
forecasting
and
outbreak
analytics
.
in

,
they
designated
$
500

where
the
coming

the
hoped-for
international
effort
dovetail
:
their
successes
will
hinge
on
data
:
more
abundant
data
,
more
granular
data
,
just
more
.
in
the
mid-20th
century
,
the
inaccuracy
of
weather
forecasting
was
the
butt
of
late-night
tv
jokes
.
what
made
it
a
reliable
endeavor
was
deploying
data-collection
devices—satellites

achieving

a
matter
of

”
she
adds
.
“
it
's
hard
to
see
how
you
can
skip
to
the
end
and
have
an
advanced
radar
system
without
first
attending
to
those
basic
pieces

when
each
of

pieces
in

”
take
test
results
,
for
instance
.
it
would
be
desirable
to
plug
in
the
results
of
any
diagnostic
tests
done
during
health
care
visits
,
to
sort
out
whether
a
wave
of
respiratory
infections
is
being
caused
by
a
common
virus
or
a
new
strain
.
but
so
many
people
lack
access
to
health
care
that
diagnostic
data
might
have
limited
predictive
power
.
on
the
other
hand
,
most
people
use
sewage
systems—where
they
exist—and
wastewater
sampling
can
detect
pathogens
without
intruding
on
individual
privacy
or
forcing
the
construction
of
interoperable
record
systems.animal
data
is
another
gap
.
structures
already
exist
for
reporting
cases
of
human
disease
and
wildlife
and
livestock
diseases
,
but
they
are
separate
,
run
by
different
united
nations
agencies
.
reports
in
one
system
won
’
t
ring
an
alarm
bell
in
another—an
oversight
,
since
so
many
emerging
diseases
are
zoonotic
,
beginning
in
animals
and
then
leaping
to
humans.that
revelation
two
weeks
ago
that
a
coronavirus
carried
by
cats
and
dogs
had
been
found
in
old
throat
swabs
from
people
proves
the
point
.
it
came
to
light
belatedly
,
because
of
an
academic
project
.
these
detections
did
not
get
reported
through
a
notification
system
,
and
there
is
no
indication
that
anyone
has
set
up
anything
new
to
track
the
virus
.
“
we
don
’
t
have
systems
now
that
could
go
keep
an
eye
on
canine
coronaviruses
,
”
carlson
says
.
“
we
know
that
this
is
a
virus
that
can
recombine
in
such
a
way
that
it
can
transmit
to
humans
.
we
've
seen
it
do
it
,
in
a
really
limited
way
.
we
know
that
is
a
potential
threat
to
health
security
.
but
there
is
no
global
monitoring.
”
the
final
question
a
pandemic
radar
will
face
is
this
:
who
benefits
?
the
colonialist
model
of
resource
extraction—take
a
commodity
from
the
global
south
,
use
it
to
benefit
the
global
north—has
tripped
up
disease
surveillance
before
.
in
2007
,
in
the
midst
of
worldwide
concern
over
the
spread
of
h5n1
avian
flu
,
indonesia
stopped
sending
viruses
collected
within
its
borders
into
the
who
’
s
flu
surveillance
network
.
the
who
scolded
the
nation
,
saying
it
was
endangering
the
world
.
the
government
of
indonesia—which
,
at
the
time
,
had
experienced
more
bird
flu
deaths
than
any
other
country—responded
that
this
was
its
only
possible
leverage
against
inequity
.
if
affluent
countries
used
indonesian
viruses
to
develop
a
bird-flu
vaccine
,
indonesia
wanted
guaranteed
,
inexpensive
access—to
not
have
to
compete
to
buy
a
product
that
would
not
have
existed
without
its
help.that
immediate
crisis
faded
,
thanks
to
a
complex
negotiation
between
the
country
and
the
who
,
but
the
underlying
issue
of
viral
sovereignty
never
really
went
away
.
it
surfaced
again
after
the
ebola
epidemic
of
2014
and
in
the
early
days
of
covid
.
it
’
s
possible
that
fresh
attention
to
the
need
for
global
surveillance
could
become
a
moment
when
global
south
countries
get
the
assistance
they
deserve
,
not
just
to
collect
their
own
data
but
to
benefit
from
it
as
well.
“
what
we
really
need
is
a
broadly
distributed
,
high-fidelity
,
always-on
surveillance
system
that
empowers
local
organizations
to
collect
information
on
their
own
populations
that
is
relevant
to
them
,
that
generates
ownership
in
their
data
,
that
empowers
them
to
advocate
for
their
community
needs
,
”
says
samuel
v.
scarpino
,
an
assistant
professor
at
northeastern
university
who
directs
its
emergent
epidemics
lab
.
“
this
is
not
something
that
can
be
built
easily
.
but
we
have
a
narrow
window
right
now
,
where
basically
the
whole
planet
knows
that
we
need
to
solve
this.
”
but
that
binary
never
accounted
for
the
many
people
who
wanted
the
shot
but
couldn
’
t
obtain
it
:
because
vaccine
campaigns
didn
’
t
come
to
their
neighborhoods
,
or
lack
of
sick
leave
would
n't
let
them
risk
side
effects
,
or
they
did
n't
meet
eligibility
criteria
in
the
early
days
when
supply
was

.
now
it
’
s
becoming
clear
that
this
binary
also
excludes
another
enormous
group
:
people
who
received
the
shot
but
were
not
protected
by
it
,
because
their
immune
systems
didn
’
t
manufacture
an
adequate
defense.millions
of
americans
are
immunosuppressed
or
immune-compromised
.
that
is
,
they
take
drugs
to
make
sure
that
a
transplanted
organ
is
not
rejected
or
to
tamp
down
the
overactive
immunity
that
produces
rheumatoid
arthritis
and
lupus
;
or
,
alternatively
,
they
have
illnesses
that
undermine
their
ability
to
defend
against
pathogens
.
a
handful
of
research
papers
published
over
the
past
few
months
all
find
the
same
result
:
when
these
patients
receive
covid
vaccines
,
their
bodies
don
’
t
create
as
many
defensive
antibodies
as
those
of
healthy
people
.
some
have
contracted
the
disease
despite
being
fully
vaccinated—meaning
that
,
to
protect
themselves
,
they
must
continue
to
behave
as
though
their
vaccinations
never
occurred.as
a
result
,
some
are
seeking
extra
vaccinations
,
arranging
for
third
doses
that
they
hope
will
act
like

shots

a
study
published
monday
in
the
annals
of
internal
medicine
by
a
team
at
johns
hopkins
university
school
of
medicine
documents
the
experience
of
30
people
living
with
organ
transplants
who
sought
out
a
third
shot
in
hopes
of
boosting
their
immune
responses
.
after
their
second
shots
,
none
of
the
30
had
high
antibody
levels
;
in
fact
,
only
six
showed
any
antibody
response
at
all
.
after
the
third
shot
,
14
out
of
30
saw
some
improvement
,
and
12
of
30
had
antibody
levels
that
the
researchers
considered
protective.this
is
an
important
finding—even
though
it
was
made
in
a
small
group
of
self-selected
volunteers
,
something
that
’
s
typically
thought
of
as
a
weak
study
design—because
it
might
point
the
way
to
letting
still-vulnerable
people
rejoin
a
post-covid
society
.
it
might
also
help
explain
some
of
the
rare
and
not-well-explained
“
breakthrough
”
infections
that
occur
in
a
small
fraction
of

“
a

to
understand
why
the
possibility
is
so
alluring—and
sticky
,
in
a
regulatory
sense—it
’
s
worth
looking
first
at
what
researchers
have
sussed
out
about
how
chronic
immune
conditions
complicate
protections
against
covid.segev
’
s
team
was
among
the
first
to
tackle
this
issue
.
last
december
,
one
day
after
the
food
and
drug
administration
issued
emergency
use
authorizations
for
the
pfizer
and
moderna
vaccines
,
the
hopkins
group
put
out
a
call
on
social
media
.
they
asked
immune-suppressed
people
to
enroll
in
a
trial
that
would
keep
track
of
their
health
and
document
their
responses
to
the
vaccines
.
they
signed
up
almost
1,000
people
in
the
first
week
,
segev
says
,
and
have
almost
4,000
in
a
registry
now.in
march
,
the
group
published
the
first
data
from
those
sign-ups
:
among
436
transplant
recipients
,
only
17
percent
showed
detectable
antibodies
after
one
dose
of
the
pfizer
or
moderna
vaccines
.
that
was
discouragingly
low
.
by
contrast
,
every
participant
in
the
mrna
vaccines
’
clinical
trials—100
percent—demonstrated
antibody
production
by
the
15th
or
21st
day
after
their
first
dose
of
the
vaccine
,
according
to
data
from
the
manufacturers
and
academic
researchers.a
follow-up
hopkins
study
evaluated
antibody
responses
after
two
doses
in
658
transplant
recipients
from
the
social
media
volunteers
,
396
of
them
participants
from
the
first
group
.
it
yielded
both
good
and
bad
news
.
good
:
259
members
of
the
study
group
,
39
percent
,
had
no
antibodies
after
their
first
dose
but
gained
them
after
their
second
.
bad
:
46
percent
of
the
participants
had
no
antibody
responses
at
all.the
hopkins
group
wasn
’
t
the
only
academic
team
thinking
about
this
problem
.
soon
after
the
vaccines
became
available
,
physicians
at
columbia
university
medical
center
in
new
york
who
were
taking
care
of
kidney
transplant
patients
became
worried
.
several
of
their
patients
qualified
for
the
earliest
doses
,
yet
after
completing
their
vaccine
courses
and
passing
their
“
immune
by
”
dates
,
several
of
them
still
came
down
with
covid
.
worried
,
the
nephrology
department
staff
began
asking
any
kidney
transplant
recipients
who
received
the
vaccines
to
have
their
antibody
levels
tested
two
weeks
after
their
second
shot
.
by
the
end
of
march
,
28
patients
went
through
that
testing
.
only
25
percent
of
them
showed
any
antibody
response.this
was
disappointing
,
but
,
immunologically
,
it
makes
sense
.
after
all
,
the
purpose
of
vaccination
is
to
induce
the
body
to
develop
a
protective
response—expressed
in
antibodies
,
along
with
other
immune
system
cells—that
defends
it
against
an
infection
.
but
the
drug
regimens
that
transplant
recipients
take
,
to
keep
their
bodies
from
rejecting
donated
organs
,
suppress
antibody
production
.
that
goal
works
against
what
the
vaccine
is
intended
to
do.
“
patients
’
immunosuppression
regimens
are
designed
to
blunt
their
immune
response
to
a
new
pathogen
,
because
typically
the
biggest
pathogen
they
're
being
exposed
to
,
so
to
speak
,
is
the
new
kidney
,
”
says
syed
ali
husain
,
an
assistant
professor
of
medicine
at
columbia
and
first
author
of
an
account
of
the
findings
,
published
in
april
.
“
their
immunosuppression
regimen
is
designed
to
prevent
antibody
production.
”
it
’
s
important
to
say
here
that
all
these
findings
are
mapping
new
territory
.
in
order
to
get
the
cleanest
,
fastest
authorization
,
people
with
immune
deficits
were
excluded
from
covid
vaccine
clinical
trials
.
there
was
a
broad
assumption
among
physicians
that
those
patients
would
have
less
response
to
the
vaccines—but
vaccine
manufacturers
didn
’
t
attempt
to
gather
that
data
.
the
run
of
studies
that
began
this
spring
represents
the
first
attempts
to
define
vaccine
effectiveness
,
or
continued
vulnerability
,
for
this
patient
pool.organ
transplant
patients
aren
’
t
the
only
people
bedeviled
by
low
antibody
counts
after
covid
vaccination
.
for
instance
,
an
april
analysis
submitted
as
a
preprint
(
so
not
yet
peer-reviewed
or
published
in
a
journal
)
of
how
people
with
blood
and
bone
marrow
cancers
responded
to
two
doses
of
covid
vaccines
showed
that
46
percent
of
them
made
no
antibodies
.
some
of
those
patients
had
their
immune
systems
suppressed
by
drug
regimens
,
and
in
others
their
cancers
were
to
blame
for
their
immune
status
.
patients
with
one
particular
blood
cancer
,
known
as
b-cell
chronic
lymphocytic
leukemia
,
were
even
less
likely
to
make
an
immune
response
:
only
23
percent
had
detectable
antibodies
,
even
though
most
of
them
were
not
taking
immune-suppressing
drugs
at
the
time.these
low
percentages
feel
unnerving
,
but
they
may
not
tell
the
whole
story
.
ghady
haidar
,
the
senior
author
on
that
analysis
and
a
transplant
infectious
diseases
physician
at
university
of
pittsburgh
medical
center
,
says
a
frustration
in
translating
risk
to
patients
is
that
we
still
don
’
t
have
good
metrics—
”
correlates
of
immunity
”
is
the
technical
term—for
what
constitutes
protection
against
covid
.
that
is
,
researchers
know
what
protective
antibody
counts
look
like
in
healthy
patients
;
but
how
far
below
that
range
an
immune-compromised
person
can
drop
and
still
be
protected
isn
’
t
yet
known.plus
,
antibodies
are
not
the
only
defense
the
body
deploys
to
create
immunity
:
we
also
make
t
cells
,
memory
b
cells
,
and
others
.
the
vaccine
clinical
trials
didn
’
t
attempt
to
measure
the
cell
counts
required
to
create
an
effective
defense
against
the
virus
.
they
reported
only
clinical
endpoints
,
such
as
whether
someone
became
seriously
ill
or
died
from
the
disease
.
so
focusing
on
antibodies
alone
may
miss
important
parts
of
the
immune
response.
“
i
try
not
to
use
words
like
‘
you
didn
’
t
respond
’
to
the
vaccine
when
someone
isn
’
t
making
antibodies
,
”
says
haidar
,
who
is
principal
investigator
on
a
larger
study
that
is
recruiting
people
with
a
range
of
immune
deficits
,
including
hiv
,
in
order
to
study
covid
vaccine
response
.
“
i
worry
that
it
might
drive
vaccine
hesitancy
if
the
messaging
is
that
the
vaccine
is
n't
working
for
you
.
i
think
we
have
to
be
a
little
more
nuanced
to
account
for
the
complexities
that
other
elements
of
the
immune
system
could
have
been
revved
up
by
the
vaccines.
”
even
in
the
few
studies
done
so
far
,
it
’
s
clear
that
immune
response
to
the
vaccines
varies
,
depending
on
the
age
of
the
patient
,
the
type
of
immune
deficit
they
are
experiencing
,
the
type
of
transplant
they
received
,
the
specific
drugs
they
take
,
the
length
of
time
since
transplant
or
last
dose
,
and
a
host
of
other
factors
.
the
likelihood
of
abundant
antibody
production
appears
higher
,
for
instance
,
in
patients
who
take
immune-suppressing
medications
to
treat
chronic
inflammatory
diseases
than
it
does
in
transplant
and
cancer
patients
.
studies
done
by
segev
and
team
show
better
rates
of
antibody
production
in
those
patients
after
one
and
two
doses
.
but
a
separate
preprint
,
done
by
washington
university
school
of
medicine
in
st.
louis
and
uc
san
francisco
,
shows
a
wide
range
of
responses
depending
on
which
drug
regimen
a
patient
is
taking.that
may
provide
a
clue
for
managing
patients
’
vulnerability
,
so
that
they
can
get
closer
to
the
kind
of
immune
protection
that
otherwise
healthy
people
receive
from
covid
vaccines
.
“
one
thing
we
are
telling
patients
who
are
in
suppression
,
who
have
n't
gotten
vaccinated
yet
,
is
to
consider
holding
their
medicine
,

alfred

kim
,
that
study
’
s
senior
author
and
an
assistant
professor
of
rheumatology
and
immunology
at
washington
university
.
“
obviously
,
if
you
hold
medicines
,
you
risk
flares
.
and
if
you
're
going
to
flare
,
this
could
make
your
vaccine
side
effects
worse
,
or
it
could
make
the
vaccine
itself
less
effective
.
it
’
s
a
really
tricky
situation.
”
and
,
legally
,
doctors
currently
can
’
t
advise
patients
to
seek
extra
doses
of
the
covid
vaccine
.
the
fda
has
authorized
only
one
or
two
doses
for
all
the
vaccines
it
has
let
enter
the
us
market
.
for
segev
’
s
team
’
s
study
,
the
doctors
didn
’
t
prescribe
third
doses—the
patients
found
third
doses
on
their
own
,
in
ways
the
study
did
not
specify
.
the
hopkins
team
tracked
the
results.still
,
there
’
s
some
evidence
in
medical
literature
to
support
the
utility
of
additional
doses
.
for
instance
,
the
french
government
has
recommended
a
third
dose
for
anyone
who
is
immunocompromised
.
and
in
the
us
,
it
’
s
been
understood
for
years
that
a
second
dose
of
seasonal
flu
vaccine
and
larger
doses
of
hepatitis
b
vaccine
are
required
to
create
immunity
in
them.but
it
will
be
necessary
to
gather
more
data
to
be
sure
.
the
hopkins
team
is
contemplating
a
larger
trial
in
which
immunosuppressed
patients
seeking
third
doses
would
be
enrolled
and
tracked
in
a
formal
way
.
and
despite
the
allure
of
higher
protection
,
they
’
re
not
urging
immune-damaged
patients
to
start
freelancing
their
own
third
shots
.
“
there
are
risks
to
taking
third
doses
,
”
segev
says
.
“
there
is
a
risk
the
third
dose
will
activate
your
immune
system
and
cause
either
an
overt
rejection
or
some
sort
of
subclinical
thing
,
where
you
start
to
develop
a
little
more
antibodies
against
your
transplanted
organ
.
it
's
important
that
people
who
do
go
out
and
get
third
doses
are
either
part
of
research
protocols
or
are
doing
this
in
collaboration
with
their
doctors
who
have
evaluated
the
risks
and
benefits.
”
if
trials
like
this
can
yield
data—another
one
,
recently
announced
,
is
being
conducted
by
the
national
institutes
of
health—they
could
do
more
than
let
the
immunocompromised
get
back
to
everyday
life
.
they
could
also
illuminate
aspects
of
the
immune
system
and
its
interaction
with
vaccines
that
are
still
not
very
well
understood
.
and
that
will
be
of
benefit
not
just
during
this
pandemic

for
whatever
we
need
to
protect
ourselves
against
next.more
than

easy
to
dismiss
all
this

swag
as
opportunistic
profiteering
,

joyful
,
and

homegrown
vaccination
signals
serve
an
important
purpose.for
more
than

face
masks
were
the
first
line
of
protection
we
had
against
a
deadly
disease
,
and
refusing
to
wear
one

a
political
signal
.
when
we
see
another

we
have
to
just
trust
that

obscure
the
fact

more
than
131
million
people
in
the
us
have
been
vaccinated
,
and
that
number
is
still
rising
,
though
the
pace
has
slowed.a
few
months
ago
,
signaling
that
you
'd
been
vaccinated
could
backfire
or
open
you
to
scorn
and
charges
that
you
got
the
vaccine
before
other
,
perhaps
more
deserving
people
.
but
now
that
vaccination
appointments
are
much
easier
to
come
by
,
wearing
a
pin
,
sticker
,
or
t-shirt
contributes
to
creating
a
new
social
norm.
“
you
have
to
have
public
support
,
not
public
confusion
,
”
viswanath
says
.
if
you
live
in
an
area
where
80
percent
of
the
population
has
been
vaccinated
and
you
walk
into
a
room
full
of
“
i
'm
vaccinated
”
pins
,
you
might
feel
a
lot
better
about
taking
off
your
mask
.
it
helps
that
a
lot
of
the
swag
is
cute
,
and
it
’
s
a
low-key
,
affordable
way
to
commemorate
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
a
life-changing
year
.
i
picked
up
an
enamel
pin
from
etsy
,
where
small
,
adorable
vaccination
merch
has
proliferated
.
the
cdc
has
printable
stickers
,
as
well
as
digital
resources
for
posting
your
vaccination
status
on
social
media
.
you
might
also
want
to
check
local
businesses
for
apparel
options
too.when
shopping
for
pins
or
t-shirts
,
try
to
avoid
sporting
slogans
that
are
scolding
or
aggressive
.
“
i
don
’
t
think
being
snarky
helps
,
”
says
susan
krenn
,
executive
director
for
the
johns
hopkins
center
for
communication
programs
.
“
it
can
be
off-putting
and
just
furthers
the
divides
that
we
’
re
already
feeling
around
masking
and
vaccination
,
and
how
politics
has
come
into
that.
”
krenn
’
s
job
is
to
work
with
governments
and
communities
to
encourage
people
to
adopt
healthy
behaviors
.
during
the
covid-19
pandemic
,
those
behaviors
included
masking
and
vaccination
.
“
this
timeline
has
been
incredibly
challenging
,
because
things
change
so
quickly
,
”
krenn
says
.
“
even
if
it
’
s
a
year
and
a
half
old
,
it
’
s
a
new
pandemic
.
we
have
to
be
flexible
or
adaptable
as
we
move
forward
.
the
ambiguity
makes
all
of
this
harder.
”
it
’
s
ok
to
err
on
the
side
of
caution
,
krenn
says
.
there
are
still
many
settings
where
the
mask
mandate
remains
clear
,
such
as
public
transportation
,
health
care
,
and
places
where
large
groups
of
people
congregate
indoors
,
like
churches
.
in
more
ambiguous
areas
,
we
're
all
learning
to
navigate
a
respectful
,
comfortable
language
of
consent
.
i
’
m
vaccinated
,
are
you
?
do
you
feel
comfortable
taking
off
your
mask
,
or
do
you
feel
comfortable
if
i
do
?
whichever
way
you
choose
to
talk
about
vaccination
,
stay
respectful
and
remember
that
there
are
valid
reasons
why
people
are
staying
masked
.
maybe
they
’
re
immunocompromised
or
they
don
’
t
want
to
risk
infecting
unvaccinated
young
children
at
home.everyone
i
spoke
to
says
there
are
many
instances
where
they
will
continue
wearing
masks
,
especially
in
health
care
or
crowded
settings
.
even
as
the
cdc
’
s
guidelines
relax
,
wearing
a
mask
doesn
’
t
mean
a
person
is
unnecessarily
paranoid
or
doesn
’
t
believe
in
science.
“
mask
wearing
shouldn
’
t
necessarily
go
away
,
”
krenn
says
.
“
continued
mask-wearing
signals
that
even
if
i
’
m
vaccinated
,
there
may
be
people
around
us
who
aren
’
t
.
this
is
a
preventative
measure
that
we
take
for
people
who
can
’
t
get
vaccinated
.
and
the
pandemic
is
not
over
.
we
’
re
in
great
shape
from
where
we
were
a
while
back
,
but
it
’
s
not
over.
”
when
i
related
my
story
about
my
neighbor
and
our
mask
confusion
,
the
researchers
i
spoke
with
laughed
and
said
that
situation
was
not
as
bad
,
nor
as
uncomfortable
,
as
it
felt
at
the
time
.
“
it
’
s
actually
a
good
thing
that
we
are
being
cautious
about
it
,
”
viswanath
says
.
“
most
people
are
like
you
and
this
person
.
we
are
complying
with
public
health
regulations
.
the
messages
have
reached
us
.
we
focus
on
the
fighting
on
airplanes
,
but
most
people
are
doing
the
right
things
.
i
think
it
will
take
some
time
to
get
over
that
discomfort
,
and
that
’
s
perfectly
fine.
”
and
even
if
many
of
us
are
confused
by
the
cdc
’
s
guidance
,
that
does
not
necessarily
mean
it
is
wrong
,
or
that
mask-shaming
anyone—for
wearing
or
not
wearing
one—will
help
move
us
closer
to
the
goal
of
reducing
infections.
“
i
believe
that
the
cdc
's
guidance
was
grounded
in
science
,
”
says
neil
maniar
,
director
of
urban
health
in
the
master
of
public
health
program
at
northeastern
university
.
“
there
’
s
been
a
good
amount
of
recent
research
coming
out
showing
that
the
vaccines
are
far
more
effective
than
even
what
we
initially
believed
,
and
there
is
evidence
that
we
can
start
to
relax
some
of
the
restrictions
for
fully
vaccinated
individuals.
”
but
as
krenn
stressed
,
the
pandemic
is
n't
over
yet
.
maniar
says
people
should
not
let
down
their
guard
too
soon
or
there
will
be
another
surge
.
“
the
more
that
we
can
communicate
the
importance
of
the
vaccine
in
an
honest
and
transparent
way
that
can
address
the
concerns
and
try
to
reduce
the
divisiveness
around
this
,
the
greater
the
likelihood
that
we
’
ll
be
able
to
put
this
pandemic
behind
us
once
and
for
all
,
”
he
says.no
,
i
'm
not
angry
,
i
'm
just
disappointed
.
actually
,
let
's
just
use
this
as
an
opportunity
to
talk
about
magnets
.
pretty
much
everywhere
you
look
,
there
is
some
device
that
uses
them
,
so
it
's
important
to
at
least
have
a
basic
understanding
of
how
they
work.you
might
think
that
the
magnet
stuck
on
your
refrigerator
is
the
simplest
example
.
nope
.
those
are
actually
quite
complicated
.
the
most
basic
magnet
is
an
electromagnet
.
electric
charges
(
like
positive
protons
and
negative
electrons
)
create
electric
fields
.
but
a
moving
electric
charge
creates
a
magnetic
field
.
you
can
make
electric
charges
move
with
just
a
battery
and
a
wire
.
by
connecting
the
wire
from
one
end
of
the
battery
to
the
other
,
an
electric
current
will
flow
,
which
is
moving
the
charges.if
you
want
to
see
that
this
electric
current
creates
a
magnetic
field
,
next
put
the
wire
over
the
top
of
a
magnetic
compass
.
you
will
see
that
the
needle
will
point
in
a
new
direction
,
like
this
:
you
can
make
the
magnetic
field
even
stronger
by
wrapping
the
wire
around
something
made
of
iron
.
now
it
’
s
an
electromagnet
.
here
's
how
to
build
the
whole
thing.if
you
consider
the
magnet
that
's
stuck
on
your
fridge
,
it
does
n't
look
like
it
has
a
battery
or
electrical
current
.
so
how
does
it
create
a
magnetic
field
?
i
'll
be
honest
,
things
start
to
get
complicated
here
.
in
order
to
figure
out
how
this
solid
object
makes
a
magnetic
field
,
we
have
to
go
down
to
the
atomic
level.all
matter
is
made
of
atoms
,
and
atoms
are
made
of
electrons
,
protons
,
and
neutrons
.
all
three
of
these
act
like
tiny
little
magnets
,
and
physicists
characterize
their
properties
using
the
term
“
magnetic
moment.
”
(
yes
,
even
the
neutral
neutron
has
a
magnetic
moment
.
)
the
total
magnetic
moment
of
an
atom
is
the
vector
sum
of
the
moments
from
all
the
particles
within
it
.
as
an
example
,
let
's
consider
two
different
atoms
,
each
with
two
particles
.
in
the
atom
on
the
left
,
the
magnetic
moments
are
in
opposite
directions
.
they
essentially
cancel
to
make
a
magnetic
field
that
is
,
overall
,
pretty
small
.
but
on
the
right
,
the
magnetic
moments
are
in
the
same
direction
,
so
they
add
together.most
atoms
have
a
very
low
magnetic
moment
,
but
there
are
some
that
do
produce
a
significant
magnetic
field
.
these
elements
are
called
ferromagnetic
materials—some
examples
are
iron
,
nickel
,
and
cobalt
.
some
alloys
and
ceramics
(
which
are
not
pure
elements
)
are
also
ferromagnetic.however
,
just
having
a
ferromagnetic
material
does
n't
make
something
a
magnet
.
if
you
grab
an
iron
nail
,
it
might
not
act
like
a
bar
magnet
,
but
it
can
be
turned
into
one
fairly
easily
.
that
’
s
because
in
small
regions
of
a
piece
of
iron
,
nearby
atoms
interact
magnetically
and
cause
their
magnetic
moments
to
align
.
this
region
of
aligned
moments
is
called
a
magnetic
domain
.
if
you
get
all
the
magnetic
domains
pointed
in
the
same
direction
,
the
iron
will
then
act
like
a
magnet.so
,
how
do
you
make
it
happen
?
simple
:
you
use
another
magnet
.
putting
a
strong
magnet
near
those
unaligned
domains
will
force
them
to
line
up
.
it
's
actually
possible
to
find
rocks
in
the
ground
that
are
both
ferromagnetic
and
have
their
domains
aligned
.
we
call
these
lodestones
.
they
may
have
been
magnetized
by
the
strong
magnetic
fields
created
during
a
lightning
strike.if
you
grab
a
bunch
of
metal
stuff
around
your
house
,
most
of
it
is
probably
steel
(
an
alloy
made
from
iron
)
or
aluminum
,
copper
,
or
brass
.
oh
,
and
your
cast
iron
pot
is
of
course
made
of
iron
.
of
these
,
only
the
iron
and
some
of
the
steel
is
attracted
to
magnets.it
's
important
to
remember
that
magnets
only
interact
with
ferromagnetic
materials
.
if
you
were
indeed
a
magnetic
human
,
only
a
steel
or
iron
spoon
would
stick
to
your
head
.
silver
ones
would
n't
work.one
of
the
arguments
the
people
in
these
spoon
videos
are
making
is
that
covid-19
vaccines
have
metal
in
them
.
in
the
center
for
disease
control
and
prevention
’
s
list
of
ingredients
for
the
three
covid
vaccines
given
emergency
use
authorization
in
the
united
states
,
the
agency
specifically
points
out
:
“
all
covid-19
vaccines
are
free
from
metals
such
as
iron
,
nickel
,
cobalt
,
lithium
,
rare
earth
alloys
or
any
manufactured
products
such
as
microelectronics
,
electrodes
,
carbon
nanotubes
,
or
nanowire
semiconductors.
”
but
the
list
does
show
that
all
three
contain
some
form
of
sodium
,
including
sodium
chloride
or
sodium
acetate
,
and
one
of
them
contains
potassium
chloride
.
both
potassium
and
sodium
can
be
metals—does
that
mean
there
’
s
some
kind
of
metal
in
there
after
all
?
no
,
writes
naomi
ginsberg
,
an
associate
professor
of
chemistry
and
physics
at
uc
berkeley
.
``
potassium
and
sodium
are
only
metallic
in
solid
form
,
but
they
are
not
solid
as
additives
in
the
injected
solution
,
”
she
told
wired
in
an
email
.
“
the
individual
ions
are
dispersed
in
the
solution
,
a
liquid
composed
of
mostly
water
and
sparse
,
individual
potassium
and
sodium
ions
,
in
addition
to
the
active
components
of
the
vaccine
.
the
ions
in
this
solution
are
basically
like
dissolved
salts
,
like
are
in
gatorade
or
pedialyte
,
which
our
body
needs
to
work
properly
but
which
get
depleted
during
exercise
.
``
and
,
of
course
,
neither
potassium
nor
sodium
is
ferromagnetic
.
they
could
n't
cause
a
magnetic
interaction
with
normal
objects.don
’
t
those
videos
of
someone
with
a
spoon
on
their
head
prove
that
they
are
magnetic
?
no
,
they
don
’
t
.
you
can
get
an
object—metal
or
not—to
stick
to
human
skin
just
because
our
sweat
makes
us
a
little
sticky
.
(
some
of
us
are
stickier
than
others
.
)
an
object
with
a
large
,
flat
surface
that
has
a
greater
contact
area
with
the
skin
will
be
more
likely
to
stay
stuck
.
but
no
magnets
are
involved.ok
,
let
’
s
take
iron
.
it
’
s
a
ferromagnetic
material
that
many
people
put
in
their
body
every
day
through
fortified
breakfast
cereals
.
yes
,
there
’
s
actually
iron
in
most
of
them
,
and
to
prove
it
,
here
is
a
classic
at-home
science
experiment
that
you
can
try

get
your
favorite
cereal
and
grind
it
up
.
put
it
in
a
cup
with
some
water
.
then
put
a
magnet
in
.
the
magnet
will
attract
the
bits
of
iron
in
the
cereal
and
you
can
pull
them
out
.
if
you
have
a
super
strong
magnet
,
it
will
work
much
better.here

the

(
i
put

for
you

writer
cody
cassidy
has
a
few
ideas.you
can
’
t
always
get
what
you
want
.
here
are
some
tips
for
returning
or
exchanging
gifts
and
purchases
that
missed
the
mark.how
will
the
world
change
if
more
people
permanently
work
remotely
?
according
to
one
economist
’
s
predictions
,
22
percent
of
workdays
are
likely
to
take
place
remotely
post-pandemic
,
compared
to
5
percent
beforehand
.
in
response
,
a
spate
of
startups
are
cropping
up
to
serve
a
new
class
of
permanently
remote
and
potentially
nomadic
workers
.
these
ventures
offer
short-term
living
situations
with
full-blown
home
offices
and
schooling
for
kids
who
are
moving
from
place
to
place
.
but
the
truth
is
we
won
’
t
know
what
a
more
remote
post-pandemic
world
looks
like
until
more
people
start
to
return
to
the
office—and
the
ones
who
don
’
t
return
have
a
better
sense
of
what
they
’
re
missing
.
in
the
early
days
of
the
covid-19
pandemic
in
the
us
,
officials
focused
limited
testing
capacity
on
symptomatic
people
who
had
recently
traveled
to
or
been
in
close
contact
with
someone
who
had
traveled
to
places
with
confirmed
outbreaks
of
sars-cov-2
.
a
year
later
,
it
’
s
clear
that
some
proportion
of
viral
transmission—perhaps
as
high
as
50
percent—comes
from
presymptomatic
or
asymptomatic
individuals
,
making
it
difficult
to
trace
transmission
.
in
a
study
published
in
clinical
infectious
diseases
june
15
,
researchers
analyzed
blood
collected
between
january
2
and
march
18
,
2020
,
and
found
antibodies
to
sars-cov-2
in
samples
from
nine
people
in
five
us
states
,
meaning
that
the
virus
was
likely
present
in
the
us
in
late
2019
.
“
we
suspected
that
there
were
probably
cases
that
preceded
the
ones
that
were
diagnosed
and
confirmed
.
this
is
very
suggestive
that
there
were
probably
multiple
exposures
prior
to
those
initial
cases
,
”
says
ashley
st.
john
,
an
infectious
disease
researcher
at
duke-nus
medical
school
in
singapore
who
was
not
involved
in
the
study
.
the
findings
also
indicate
“
that
we
can
probably
use
serology
to
find
potentially
even
earlier
exposures
in
a
similar
way.
”
in
2018
,
researchers
at
the
national
institutes
of
health
and
their
collaborators
across
the
us
started
recruiting
volunteers
for
the
all
of
us
research
program—the
aim
of
which
is
to
collect
individualized
health
data
from
lots
of
people
over
many
years
with
the
ultimate
goal
of
making
medicine
more
individualized
.
the
study
was
therefore
trekking
along
,
gathering
participants
’
medical
history
and
blood
samples
across
the
us
in
early
2020
when
sars-cov-2
showed
up.as
public
health
shutdowns
started
and
recruitment
and
testing
for
longitudinal
studies
paused
,
keri
althoff
,
an
epidemiologist
at
the
johns
hopkins
bloomberg
school
of
public
health
,
and
her
colleagues
on
the
all
of
us
team
talked
about
if
they
could
look
in
previously
collected
specimens
to
see
whether
or
not
there
were
antibodies
present
that
would
target
sars-cov-2
.
this
line
of
investigation
could
“
help
us
put
together
the
puzzle
about
the
early
days
,
because
that
can
help
us
understand
where
we
can
improve
upon
for
preparedness
for
future
outbreaks
,
”
she
says
.
researchers
across
the
country
were
simultaneously
developing
tests
to
detect
these
antibodies
,
so
the
all
of
us
team
created
a
partnership
with
a
group
at
quest
diagnostics
and
sent
samples
to
their
clinical
lab
for
antibody
testing
.
they
requested
two
tests
for
each
sample
:
one
for
antibodies
that
target
the
protein
that
surrounds
the
sars-cov-2
genome
and
one
for
antibodies
that
target
the
viral
spike
protein
.
out
of
the
24,079
people
who
gave
blood
specimens
between
january
2
and
march
18
,
2020
,
147
were
positive
for
antibodies
directed
toward
the
nucleocapsid
.
just
nine
participants
tested
positive
for
antibodies
on
both
tests
.
the
earliest
positive
sample—from
a
participant
in
illinois
taken
on
january
7—was
collected
more
than
two
weeks
before
the
first
official
case
report
in
the
state
on
january
24
.
the
researchers
also
found
sars-cov-2
antibodies
in
people
from
massachusetts
,
wisconsin
,
pennsylvania
,
and
mississippi
in
samples
collected
before
these
states
had
official
cases
.
“
on
average
,
it
takes
about
two
weeks
for
[
immunoglobulin
g
]
antibodies
to
be
detectable
.
.
.
so
now
we
’
re
talking
about
a
december
24
potential
infection
or
sometime
even
prior
to
that
,
”
explains
althoff
.
she
adds
that
the
results
corroborate
and
extend
findings
from
a
november
2020
study
led
by
researchers
at
the
centers
for
disease
control
that
found
sars-cov-2
antibodies
in
blood
collected
from
donors
in
december
2019
and
january
2020
in
california
,
connecticut
,
iowa
,
massachusetts
,
michigan
,
oregon
,
rhode
island
,
washington
,
and
wisconsin
.
“
that
there
were
some
cases
of
covid-19
prior
to
the
documented
cases
[
is
]
a
reasonable
conclusion
,
based
on
the
fact
that
it
’
s
unlikely
that
we
caught
the
very
first
case
in
many
of
these
locations
,
”
says
saahir
khan
,
a
clinician-scientist
at
the
university
of
california
,
irvine
,
who
did
not
participate
in
the
work
.
because
the
authors
found
a
very
small
number
of
antibody-positive
individuals
in
this
relatively
large
sample
that
they
tested
,
he
adds
,
it
’
s
possible
that
the
number
of
antibody
positives
that
they
detected
here
are
not
true
positives.
“
when
you
have
a
situation
where
it
’
s
a
very
low
prevalence
,
false
positives
are
something
that
you
wrestle
with
,
”
acknowledges
althoff
,
but
the
sequential
testing
strategy
of
two
positives
,
the
subsequent
quantification
of
the
antibodies
in
those
samples
,
and
the
simulation
models
that
the
researchers
ran
to
predict
healthcare
use
,
cases
,
and
deaths
all
indicate
that
it
’
s
very
unlikely
that
the
results
are
due
to
error
.
other
lines
of
evidence
they
could
pursue
in
the
future
,
according
to
st.
john
,
are
neutralization
assays
,
in
which
researchers
mix
antibody-positive
serum
or
antibodies
isolated
from
blood
samples
with
live
virus
and
see
what
happens
.
as
it
is
,
the
results
are
“
very
strongly
suggestive
,
but
a
neutralization
test
would
have
just
really
sealed
the
deal
for
me
,
”
she
says
.
as
for
what
the
results
mean
for
the
origins
of
sars-cov-2
in
the
us
,
“
it
’
s
important
to
remember
this
is
a
very
small
sampling
of
what
’
s
happening
in
the
country
at
that
time
,
”
st.
john
explains
.
“
it
could
be
many
more
infections
than
we
anticipated
,
”
she
adds
.
“
it
’
s
a
wake-up
call
in
some
sense
that
we
need
to
improve
our
surveillance
for
detection
of
these
types
of
emerging
infectious
diseases
,
so
that
we
can
catch
more
of
the
early
cases
,
because
it
really
emphasizes
that
we
have
a
small
view
of
what
was
happening.

the

to
anastasia
vlasova
,
an
expert
in
animal
coronaviruses
at
the
ohio

,
and
she
found
that
the

a
chimera—portions

,
the

fatality

in

has
been
reported
to

this
may
either
be
due
to
selection
bias
wherein
the
cases
reporting
from

included
only
the

or
due

is
defined
as
one

however
cases
may
be
asymptomatic

.
a
confirmed
case
is
a
suspect
case
with
a
positive
molecular
test.specific
diagnosis
is
by
specific
molecular
tests
on
respiratory
samples
(

may
also
be
detected
in

.
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
multiplex
pcr
panels
currently
available
do
not
include
the
covid-19
.
commercial
tests
are
also
not
available
at
present
.
in
a
suspect
case
in
india
,
the
appropriate
sample
has
to
be
sent
to
designated
reference
labs
in
india
or
the
national
institute
of
virology
in
pune
.
as
the
epidemic
progresses
,
commercial
tests
will
become
available.other
laboratory
investigations
are
usually
non
specific
.
the
white
cell
count
is
usually
normal

low
.
there
may
be
lymphopenia
;
a
lymphocyte
count
<

been
associated
with
severe

the
platelet
count
is
usually
normal
or
mildly
low
.
the
crp
and
esr
are
generally
elevated

procalcitonin
levels
are
usually
normal

a
high
procalcitonin

may
indicate
a
bacterial
co-infection
.
the
alt/ast
,
prothrombin
time
,
creatinine
,
d-dimer
,
cpk
and
ldh
may
be
elevated
and
high
levels
are
associated
with
severe
disease.the
chest
x-ray
(
cxr
)
usually
shows
bilateral
infiltrates
but
may
be
normal
in
early
disease
.
the
ct
is
more
sensitive
and
specific
.
ct
imaging
generally
shows
infiltrates
,
ground
glass
opacities

sub
segmental
consolidation
.
it
is
also
abnormal
in
asymptomatic
patients/
patients
with
no
clinical
evidence
of
lower
respiratory
tract
involvement
.
in
fact
,
abnormal
ct
scans
have
been
used
to
diagnose
covid-19
in
suspect
cases
with
negative
molecular
diagnosis
;
many
of
these
patients
had
positive
molecular
tests
on
repeat
testing
[
22
]
.the
differential
diagnosis
includes
all
types
of
respiratory
viral
infections
[
influenza
,
parainfluenza
,
respiratory
syncytial
virus
(

,
atypical

bacterial
infections
.
it
is
not
possible
to
differentiate
covid-19
from
these
infections
clinically
or
through
routine
lab
tests
.
therefore
travel
history
becomes
important
.
however
,
as
the
epidemic
spreads
,
the
travel
history
will
become
irrelevant.treatment
is
essentially
supportive
and
symptomatic.the
first
step
is
to
ensure
adequate
isolation
(
discussed
later
)
to
prevent
transmission
to
other
contacts
,
patients
and
healthcare
workers
.
mild
illness
should
be
managed
at
home
with
counseling
about
danger
signs
.
the
usual
principles
are
maintaining
hydration
and
nutrition
and
controlling
fever
and

.
routine

[

.since
at
this
time
there
are
no
approved
treatments
for
this
infection
,
prevention
is
crucial
.
several
properties
of
this
virus
make
prevention
difficult
namely
,
non-specific
features
of
the
disease
,
the
infectivity
even
before
onset
of
symptoms
in
the
incubation
period
,
transmission
from
asymptomatic
people
,
long
incubation
period
,
tropism
for
mucosal
surfaces
such
as
the
conjunctiva
,
prolonged
duration
of
the
illness
and
transmission
even
after
clinical
recovery.isolation
of
confirmed
or
suspected
cases
with
mild
illness
at
home
is
recommended
.
the
ventilation
at
home
should
be
good
with
sunlight
to
allow
for
destruction
of
virus
.
patients
should
be
asked
to
wear
a
simple
surgical
mask
and
practice
cough
hygiene
.
caregivers
should
be
asked
to
wear
a
surgical
mask
when
in
the
same
room
as
patient
and
use
hand
hygiene
every
15–20
min.the
greatest
risk
in
covid-19
is
transmission
to
healthcare
workers
.
in
the
sars
outbreak
of
2002
,
21
%
of
those
affected
were
healthcare
workers
[
31
]
.
till
date
,
almost
1500
healthcare
workers
in
china
have
been
infected
with
6
deaths
.
the
doctor
who
first
warned
about
the
virus
has
died
too
.
it
is
important
to
protect
healthcare
workers
to
ensure
continuity
of
care
and
to
prevent
transmission
of
infection
to
other
patients
.
while
covid-19
transmits
as
a
droplet
pathogen
and
is
placed
in
category
b
of
infectious
agents
(
highly
pathogenic
h5n1
and
sars
)
,
by
the
china
national
health
commission
,
infection
control
measures
recommended
are
those
for
category
a
agents
(
cholera
,
plague
)
.
patients
should
be
placed
in
separate
rooms
or
cohorted
together
.
negative
pressure
rooms
are
not
generally
needed
.
the
rooms
and
surfaces
and
equipment
should
undergo
regular
decontamination
preferably
with
sodium
hypochlorite
.
healthcare
workers
should
be
provided
with
fit
tested
n95
respirators
and
protective
suits
and
goggles
.
airborne
transmission
precautions
should
be
taken
during
aerosol
generating
procedures
such
as
intubation
,
suction
and
tracheostomies
.
all
contacts
including
healthcare
workers
should
be
monitored
for
development
of
symptoms
of
covid-19
.
patients
can
be
discharged
from
isolation
once
they
are
afebrile
for
atleast
3
d
and
have
two
consecutive
negative
molecular
tests
at
1
d
sampling
interval
.
this
recommendation
is
different
from
pandemic
flu
where
patients
were
asked
to
resume
work/school
once
afebrile
for
24
h
or
by
day
7
of
illness
.
negative
molecular
tests
were
not
a
prerequisite
for
discharge.at
the
community
level
,
people
should
be
asked
to
avoid
crowded
areas
and
postpone
non-essential
travel
to
places
with
ongoing
transmission
.
they
should
be
asked
to
practice
cough
hygiene
by
coughing
in
sleeve/
tissue
rather
than
hands
and
practice
hand
hygiene
frequently
every
15–20
min
.
patients
with
respiratory
symptoms
should
be
asked
to
use
surgical
masks
.
the
use
of
mask
by
healthy
people
in
public
places
has
not
shown
to
protect
against
respiratory
viral
infections
and
is
currently
not
recommended
by
who
.
however
,
in
china
,
the
public
has
been
asked
to
wear
masks
in
public
and
especially
in
crowded
places
and
large
scale
gatherings
are
prohibited
(
entertainment
parks
etc
)
.
china
is
also
considering
introducing
legislation
to
prohibit
selling
and
trading
of
wild
animals
[
32
]
.the
international
response
has
been
dramatic
.
initially
,
there
were
massive
travel
restrictions
to
china
and
people
returning
from
china/
evacuated
from
china
are
being
evaluated
for
clinical
symptoms
,
isolated
and
tested
for
covid-19
for
2
wks
even
if
asymptomatic
.
however
,
now
with
rapid
world
wide
spread
of
the
virus
these
travel
restrictions
have
extended
to
other
countries
.
whether
these
efforts
will
lead
to
slowing
of
viral
spread
is
not
known.a
candidate
vaccine
is
under
development.at
the
time
of
writing
this
article
,
the
risk
of
coronavirus
in
india
is
extremely
low
.
but
that
may
change
in
the
next
few
weeks
.
hence
the
following
is
recommended
:
healthcare
providers
should
take
travel
history
of
all
patients
with
respiratory
symptoms
,
and
any
international
travel
in
the
past
2
wks
as
well
as
contact
with
sick
people
who
have
travelled
internationally.they
should
set
up
a
system
of
triage
of
patients
with
respiratory
illness
in
the
outpatient
department
and
give
them
a
simple
surgical
mask
to
wear
.
they
should
use
surgical
masks
themselves
while
examining
such
patients
and
practice
hand
hygiene
frequently.suspected
cases
should
be
referred
to
government
designated
centres
for
isolation
and
testing
(
in
mumbai
,
at
this
time
,
it
is
kasturba
hospital
)
.
commercial
kits
for
testing
are
not
yet
available
in
india.patients
admitted
with
severe
pneumonia
and
acute
respiratory
distress
syndrome
should
be
evaluated
for
travel
history
and
placed
under
contact
and
droplet
isolation
.
regular
decontamination
of
surfaces
should
be
done
.
they
should
be
tested
for
etiology
using
multiplex
pcr
panels
if
logistics
permit
and
if
no
pathogen
is
identified
,
refer
the
samples
for
testing
for
sars-cov-2.all
clinicians
should
keep
themselves
updated
about
recent
developments
including
global
spread
of
the
disease.non-essential
international
travel
should
be
avoided
at
this
time.people
should
stop
spreading
myths
and
false
information
about
the
disease
and
try
to
allay
panic
and
anxiety
of
the
public.this

has
challenged
the
economic

some
of
the
severe

symptoms
of
covid-19
seem
to
result
from
the
activity
of
specific
immune
cells
,
which
can
cause
long-term
inflammation
of
the
lungs
.
alexander

at

his

.
most
of
these

had
high
numbers
of
a
certain
type
of
t
cell
,
a
class
of
immune
cells
,
in
their
lungs
.
the
researchers
also
found
that
nearly
70
%
of
alveolar
macrophages
,
a
type
of
immune
cell
that
is
located
in
the
tiny
air
sacs
of
the
lungs
,
contained
sars-cov-2
.
the
cells
harbouring
the
virus
showed
relatively
high
expression
of
genes
involved
in
inflammation
.
the
findings
suggest
that
,
once
the
virus
reaches
the
lungs
,
it
can
infect
macrophages
,
which
respond
by
producing
inflammatory
molecules
that
attract

could
lead

the
2019
coronavirus
is
one
of
hundreds
we
know
of
,
and
one
of
seven
known
to
infect
humans
.
these
viruses
affect
the
lungs
and
also
cause
fever
and
sometimes
gastrointestinal
problems
.
the
world
health
organization
declared
the
coronavirus
situation
a
global
emergency
in
january
2020
and
a
pandemic
in
mid-march
.
the
pandemic
will
likely
end
,
but
some
experts
now
say
it
's
possible
the
virus
will
become
endemic
and
stick
around
in
a
less
lethal
form
.
we
do
n't
know
exactly
when
and
how
the
virus
jumped
from
bats
to
humans
,
though
efforts
are
underway
to
trace
sars-cov-2
back
to
its
origins.the
most
common
symptoms
of
covid-19
are
dry
cough
,
fever
,
and
shortness
of
breath
.
others
include
diarrhea
and
loss
of
smell
or
taste
.
some
people
develop
severe
blood
clots
.
the
disease
is
mercurial—fairly
mild
for
some
and
fatal
for
others
.
scientists
can
’
t
say
definitively
why
,
but
women
are
less
likely
to
die
than
men
.
we
know
that
older
people
,
especially
those
with
underlying
health
issues
,
are
more
at
risk
.
and
children
fare
better
than
adults
,
but
for
babies
,
toddlers
,
and
kids
with
other
conditions
the
disease
can
be
severe
.
on
the
long
road
to
recovery
,
people
have
experienced
``
brain
fog
''
,
heart
issues
,
and
a
spate
of
other
long-haul
problems.social
distancing
is
about
staying
away
from
other
people
for
long
enough
to
slow
the
spread
of
the
virus
.
when
you
do
have
to
be
near
others
,
like
at
the
grocery
store
,
while
delivering
food
,
or
going
for
a
walk
,
the
centers
for
disease
control
and
prevention
recommends
staying
6
feet
away
.
to
enforce
this
,
many
states
have
implemented
shelter-in-place
orders
at
points
throughout
the
pandemic
.
as
places
have
started
to
reopen—and
rolled
back
reopening
plans—everyone
has
questions
about
what
's
safe
.
you
should
still
avoid
travel
,
especially
by
airplane
.
scientists
are
still
trying
to
figure
out
exactly
how
the
virus
spreads
through
air
,
especially
in
dense
cities
.
to
navigate
life
amidst
the
pandemic
,
some
public
health
experts
have
also
made
color-coded
guides
.
but
there
's
no
foolproof
way
to
calculate
risk
.
the
only
way
to
avoid
spreading
covid-19
is
to
follow
all
of
the
public
health
guidelines
we
have
as
much
as
possible.we
now
know
that
you
're
far
more
likely
to
get
coronavirus
from
shared
air
than
a
shared
surface
.
that
said
,
it
's
not
a
bad
idea
to
regularly
clean
and
disinfect
high-touch
belongings
and
surfaces
like
doorknobs
,
remote
controls
,
and
counters
.
one
of
the
most
important
things
you
can
do
,
of
course
,
is
wash
your
hands
!
you
’
ll
want
soap
or
disinfectant
.
you
can
also
make
your
own
sanitizer
at
home.the
cdc
recommends
wearing
a
mask
if
not
doubling
up
in
public
places
where
social
distancing
measures
are
hard
to
maintain
.
they
're
a
must-have
,
and
here
area
few
of
our
favorites

when
you
're
stocking
up
,
remember
that
not
all

were
created

you
should
layer
a

news
is
that
,
so
far
,
the
vaccines
we
have
are
still
effective
enough
at
protecting
against
these
new
variants
.
and
not
all
variants
are
cause
for
alarm
.
as
scientists
boost
genetic
sequencing
to
trace
these
and
other
mutations
more
effectively
and
vaccination
drives
continue
,
the
advent
of
these
strains
means
it
's
more
important
than
ever
to
abide
by
social
distancing
guidelines.at
times
,
especially
over
the
holidays
,
many
people
have
operated
on
the
assumption
that
a
negative
test
means
it
's
safe
to
gather
with
others
.
but
as
we
know
from
last
fall
's
superspreader
event
at
the
white
house
,
we
need
to
do
more
than
just
test
to
keep
the
virus
from
spreading
.
and
even
the
test
results
themselves
do
n't
necessarily
account
for
the
nuances
of
the
disease.at
the
moment
,
there
’
s
no
definitive
treatment
for
covid-19
.
some
researchers
investigated
chloroquine
,
the
malaria
drug
touted
by
president
trump
,
but
there
's
no
evidence
that
it
's
a
viable
treatment
.
others
looked
into
using
an
anti-influenza
drug
and
crispr
to
treat
the
disease
.
the
antiviral
remdesivir
may
also
be
helpful
,
though
expensive
.
the
hope
is
that
research
will
find
old
drugs
effective
for
treating
covid-19
,
thereby
simplifying
the
drug
discovery
process
.
all
in
all
,
though
,
covid-19
drug
research
has
proven
to
be
pretty
messy.for
the

,
generic
drugs
could
be
helpful
for
those
battling
covid-19
.
blood
from
recovered
patients
is
also
promising
.
though
we
do
n't
know
exactly
how
effective
it
is
,
and
getting
it
to
those
in
need
is
a
challenge
,
the
food
and
drug
administration
has
ok
'd
its
emergency

.
researchers
are
also
investigating
antibodies
from
the
rare
people
who
seem
to
have
strong
defenses
naturally
in

.
and
ai
is
being
used
to
accelerate
everything
from

to
drug
discovery
.
most
of
all
,
it
’
s
important
to
remember
that
finding
treatments
takes
time
,
and
there
are
a

december
,
the
us
approved
its
first
two
covid-19
vaccines
,
from
pfizer-biontech
and
moderna
.
this
was
a
blazingly
fast
scientific
achievement
,
all
the
more
so
when
you
consider
that
both
are
the
first-ever
approved
vaccines
that
use
mrna
to
train
the
immune
system
to
recognize
and
fight
off
sars-cov-2
.
though
very
few
serious
adverse
reactions
have
been
reported
,
many
people
experience
side
effects
,
typically
a
day
or
two
of
feverlike
symptoms
.
the
fact
that
these
vaccines
were
authorized
for
emergency
use
could
have
some
bearing
on
the
fate
of
their
ongoing
trials
.
and
now
that
they
've
been
approved
for
use
in
adults
,
trials
for
use
in
teens
and
tweens
are
underway
.
in
late
february
,
the
fda
also
approved
a
third
vaccine
,
from
johnson
&
johnson
.
though
it
paused
the
vaccine
's
use
for
a
short
time
in
april
due
to
concerns
about
rare
blood
clots
,
the
shot
is
now
back
in
use
,
as
its
benefits
outweigh
the
risks.meanwhile
,
trials
for
a
number
of
other
vaccines
are
ongoing
.
this
is
a
good
thing
:
we
'll
need
many
vaccines
to
inoculate
everyone
,
and
it
's
always
possible
that
vaccines
in
trials
now
may
prove
even
better
than
the
ones
we
already
have
.
now
that
more
and
more
new
variants
are
emerging
,
research
has
also
begun
to
figure
out
how
to
update
existing
shots.where
rollout
is
concerned
,
two
questions
have
loomed
large
:
what
order
should
people
get
the
vaccine
in
,
and
how
can
they
get
vaccinated
as
efficiently
as
possible
?
two
of
the
three
shots
approved
for
use
in
the
us
right
now
,
from
pfizer-biontech
and
moderna
,
require
two
doses
and
must
be
stored
at
very
cold
temperatures
,
two
factors
that
have
complicated
distribution
.
there
's
also
the
issue
of
supply
.
so
far
,
many
americans
have
had
difficulty
figuring
out
when
they
're
eligible
and
scheduling
an
appointment
.
some
experts
have
floated
the
idea
of
setting
up
mass
vaccination
clinics
,
but
even
this
would
n't
fully
address
issues
of
equity
and
access
.
distribution
plans
disproportionately
favor
people
with
time
and
internet
access
,
often
sidelining
those
most
in
need
.
on
top
of
all
this
,
there
's
the
importance
of
building
trust
among
the
vaccine-hesitant
,
especially
within
communities
that
have
historically
borne
the
brunt
of
medical
racism
.
for

truly

,
even

need
to
take

emergence

this
worrying

comes
at
a
pivotal
moment
in

course

:
public

are
just
now
trying

reports
that
so
many
mutations
have
arisen
all
at
once
in
the
new
coronavirus—and
that
these
mutations
could
have
epidemiological
consequences—add
an
important
,
but
so
far
unappreciated
,
wrinkle
to
these
deliberations
.
the
pathogen
likely
has
more
opportunity
to
develop
mutations
in
immunocompromised
individuals
than
in
other
carriers
.
as
a
result
,
to
guard
against
the
emergence
of
new
and
more
dangerous
variants
of
sars-cov-2
,
we
should
consider
moving
immunocompromised
people—who
are
themselves
at
higher
risk
of
dying
from
covid-19—closer
to
the
front
of
the
vaccination
line.scientists
are
still
puzzling
over
how
the
streak
of
new
mutations
arose
in
the
uk
variant
.
it
could
just
be
a
fluke
of
how
the
virus
has
been
tracked
,
where
they
somehow
missed
a
gradual
accumulation
of
changes
as
it
passed
from
person
to
person
through
the
population
.
but
the
abruptness
with
which
the
suite
of
new
mutations
cropped
up
has
left
researchers
worried
that
all
or
most
of
the
changes
developed
in
a
single
person
.
when
an
active
infection
lingers
in
someone
’
s
body
,
an
arms
race
may
develop
between
the
virus
and
the
immune
system
.
over
time
,
mutations
that
allow
the
virus
to
evade
successive
waves
of
defenses
such
as
antibodies
could
stack
up
;
and
the
longer
an
infection
lasts
in
a
person
,
the
more
opportunities
the
virus
has
to
add
such
variants.since
early
in
the
pandemic
,
doctors
have
suspected
that
people
who
are
immunocompromised
are
particularly
prone
to
just
that
kind
of
extended
illness
.
most
people
with
covid-19
are
thought
to
stop
shedding
infectious
virus
after
around
10
days
from
the
time
they
were
infected
,
but
numerous
outlier
cases
have
been
identified
.
these
tend
to
involve
people
with
weakened
immune
systems
.
a
71-year-old
woman
who
became
infected
with
the
virus
at
a
washington
nursing
home
in
february
,
and
who
had
a
kind
of
cancer
that
limited
her
antibody
production
,
ended
up
harboring
the
coronavirus
for
at
least
105
days
and
being
infectious
for
at
least
70.could
the
virus
mutate
rapidly
under
such
conditions
?
it
’
s
certainly
pretty
stable
over
the
course
of
a
normal
,
shorter
bout
of
covid
.
a
study
posted
online
,
which
has
not
yet
been
formally
reviewed
and
published
in
a
journal
,
found
very
little
viral
mutation
occurring
in
a
general
sampling
of
more
than
1,000
people
with
the
disease
.
at
the
same
time
,
studies
that
have
closely
followed
immunocompromised
individuals
have
been
less
reassuring
.
michigan
researchers
followed
a
60-year-old
man
with
cancer
who
was
on
medication
to
suppress
his
immune
system
’
s
b
cells
,
which
normally
produce
antibodies
.
over
the
four
months
that
they
tracked
him
,
the
researchers
found
that
sars-cov-2
’
s
spike
protein
,
which
is
the
principal
target
of
covid
vaccines
,
remained
unchanged
.
however
they
did
observe
other
mutations
that
popped
up
elsewhere
in
the
virus
,
unrelated
to
the
spike
protein.meanwhile
,
scientists
who
studied
the
immunocompromised
woman
from
the
washington
nursing
home
“
observed
marked
within-host
genomic
evolution
of
sars-cov-2
with
continuous
turnover
of
dominant
viral
variants.
”
in
other
words
,
the
virus
was
definitely
evolving
variants—including
those
with
changes
to
the
spike
protein
sequence—during
the
course
of
her
infection.another
group
,
writing
in
the
new
england
journal
of
medicine
earlier
this
month
,
detailed
the
trajectory
of
the
virus
in
a
45-year-old
man
with
an
autoimmune
disorder
for
which
he
was
receiving
immunosuppressants
.
in
this
case
they
found
there
was
“
accelerated
”
evolution
of
the

in
the
individual

and

of

were
in

they

,
but
“

the
potential
for

and
accelerated
viral
evolution
associated
with

state.
”
the
same
phenomenon
has
been
observed
in
other
conditions
where
the
immune
system
is
hampered
.

,
which
allows
it
to

astoundingly
high
rate
,
making
it
even
harder
for
the
body
to
keep
producing
antibodies
that
bind
and
neutralize
the

.
by
the

mechanism
,
hiv

,
we
need
a
better
understanding
of
exactly
which
immunocompromised
patients
are
most
vulnerable
to
long-lasting
sars-cov-2
infection
.
the
category
of

confer

brian
wasik
,
a
virologist
at
cornell
university
,
points
out
that
the
term
may
include
people
born
with
rare
disorders
that
diminish
their
ability
to
fight
off
pathogens
,
as
well
as
those
who
are
taking
immunosuppressants
to
allow
for
a
transplant
or
quell
an
autoimmune
disease.evidence
for
the
links
between
immunocompromised
individuals
and
persistent
sars-cov-2
infections
,
and
between
persistent
infections
and
viral
evolution
,
is
compelling
enough
to
be
considered
in
discussions
about
vaccine
priority
.
on
sunday
,
a
panel
from
the
us
centers
for
disease
control
and
prevention
recommended
that
immunocompromised
people
be
placed
in
“
phase
1c
”
—the
third
wave—of

rollout
.

the
injections
at
the
same
time
as
those
with
cancer
,
coronary
heart
disease
,
or

,
among
other
conditions
.
that
decision
was
meant
to
address
the
particular
risks
posed
by
covid-19
to
people
with
immune
system
issues
,
but
it
left
out
the
possibility
that
vaccinating
these
individuals
could
help
prevent
the
development
of
new
sars-cov-2
variants
that
would
make
this
pandemic
even
worse
than
it
already
is
.
for
that
reason
,
even
though
there
are
only
a
handful
of
directly
relevant
case
reports
,
public
health
officials
should
consult
with
virologists
about
whether
it
might
be
wise
to
move
immunocompromised
people
into
the
earlier
phase

group.at
the
very
least
,
we
need

of

the

should

more
to

that
has
tried
to
capture

data
during

it

falling
short

where
the

adam
lauring
of
the
university
of
michigan
medical
school
,
who
adds
that
his
team
has
uploaded
around
2
percent
of

data
in

.
“
there
are
vast

on
this
task
.
better
monitoring
of
viral
evolution
might
also
help
to
clarify
the
question
of
exactly
where—in
which
sick
people—these
changes
are
most
likely
to
accumulate.as
we
monitor
for
sars-cov-2
mutations
,
we
have
to
acknowledge
that
understanding
their
epidemiological
and
clinical
significance
requires
further
work
.
meanwhile
,
the
virus
is
still
rampant
,
which
provides
more
opportunities
for
it
to
mutate
even
as
it
spreads
from
person
to
person
.
but
the
long-lasting
infections
in
some
immunocompromised
individuals
,
and
the
associated
potential
for
viral
evolution
,
should
be
a
focus
of
attention.but
retreat
does
not
always
mean
defeat
.
and
the
emergence
of
several
worrisome
new
coronavirus
variants
with
new
tricks
for
spreading
faster
or
evading
immune
responses
presents
another
possibility
:
that
the
current
reprieve
will
only
be
temporary
.
public
health
experts
are
urging
governments
to
prepare
for
a
possible
new
wave
of
infections
driven
by
variants
like
b.1.1.7
,
which
has
already
been
identified
in
more
than
1,200
us
cases
and
in
nearly
every
state
,
according
to
data
from
the
us
centers
for
disease
prevention
and
control.that
’
s
more
than
double
the
number
reported
two
weeks
earlier
.
but
the
real
number
is
likely
far
higher
.
how
much
higher
?
no
one
knows
.
that
’
s
because
the
only
way
to
tell
which
version
of
the
coronavirus
is
causing
an
infection
is
to
sequence
its
genome
.
in
this
country
,
that
should
be
easy
enough—the
us
is
a
sequencing
superpower
.
it
has
dozens
of
academic
institutions
and
massive
commercial
labs
with
the
capacity
to
crank
out
genomes
at
a
rapid
clip
.
but
the
federal
government
’
s
response
through
much
of
the
pandemic
didn
’
t
include
a
plan
to
mobilize
america
’
s
dna-mappers
into
a
coordinated
coronavirus-monitoring
corps
.
sars-cov-2
surveillance
,
well
,
sucked.at
the
end
of
last
year
,
the
cdc
finally
got
the
green
light
to
roll
out
additional
programs
and
funding
aimed
at
changing
that
.
since
then
,
the
us
has
boosted
its
sequencing
from
about
3,000
viral
genomes
per
week
to
more
than
7,000
.
but
scientists
say
it
’
s
still
not
close
to
enough
.
and
we
’
re
running
out
of
time
to
catch
up
.
because
while
congress
debates
a
bill
that
could
provide
the
necessary
infusion
of
funds
for
building
out
the
genomic
surveillance
system
the
us
should
have
had
all
along
,
variants—both
the
ones
scientists
know
to
be
worried
about
and
the
ones
they
haven
’
t
discovered
yet—are
expanding
their
territory.
“
across
the
us
right
now
,
we
’
re
seeing
a
doubling
of
b.1.1.7
every
10
days
,
”
says
karthik
gangavarapu
,
a
computational
biologist
at
the
scripps
institute
in
la
jolla
,
california
.
he
’
s
part
of
a
team
of
researchers
that
has
been
tracking
the
rapid
spread
of
the
extra-contagious
lineage
,
which
is
still
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
“
uk
variant
,
”
in
a
study
posted
online
earlier
this
month
,
the
team
analyzed
more
than
200
viral
genomes
of
the
b.1.1.7
lineage
collected
from
around
the
country
,
and
they
found
that
the
variant
most
likely
arrived
in
the
us
in
november
,
a
month
before
it
was
first
detected
here
.
then
they
calculated
how
fast
the
variant
spread
during
the
months
of
december
and
january
:
between
35
and
45
percent
faster
than
existing
us
strains
.
though
it
has
not
yet
been
published
in
a
peer-reviewed
journal
,
the
data
provides
the
first
hard
evidence
bolstering
a
forecast
issued
in
january
by
the
cdc
,
projecting
that
b.1.1.7
would
become
the
dominant
variant
in
the
us
by
late
march.
“
what
we
’
ve
seen
over
the
last
few
weeks
is
that
things
are
basically
trending
the
way
we
thought
they
would
,
”
says
william
lee
,
the
vice
president
of
science
at
helix
and
a
coauthor
on
the
study
.
helix
,
a
san
diego-based
dna
testing
lab
in
partnership
with
illumina
,
is
one
of
three
commercial
labs
contracted
by
the
cdc
to
conduct
genomic
surveillance
of
sars-cov-2
.
technically
,
illumina
does
the
sequencing
and
helix
provides
the
viral
material
,
recovered
from
nasal
swabs
the
company
uses
to
test
for
coronavirus
.
and
because
of
a
quirk
in
the
test
’
s
design
,
helix
can
easily
flag
the
samples
most
likely
to
contain
b.1.1.7.it
’
s
not
a
unique
quirk
,
but
like
many
other
covid-19
tests
,
helix
’
s
hunts
for
three
snippets
of
the
virus
’
s
genome
.
one
of
those
snippets
is
on
the
s
gene
,
which
codes
for
the
virus
’
s
infection-enabling
spike
protein
.
the
b.1.1.7
variant
happens
to
have
a
six-letter
deletion
on
that
section
of
the
s
gene
.
so
the
test
for
a
person
infected
with
it
still
comes
back
positive
,
but
missing
the
s
gene
signal
.
scientists
have
dubbed
it
“
s
gene
dropout
”
or
“
s
gene
target
failure
,
”
sgtf
for
short
.
it
can
be
a
useful
shortcut
for
estimating
how
widely
b.1.1.7
is
circulating
in
an
area
,
but
because
other
innocuous
variants
also
have
the
same
deletion
,
the
only
way
to
know
for
sure
is
to
sequence.after
the
uk
sounded
the
alarm
over
b.1.1.7
in
late
december
,
helix
began
sending
every
sgtf
sample
off
to
illumina
for
sequencing
.
back
then
,
they
’
d
find
about
100
instances
of
s
gene
dropout
every
day
.
and
most
of
them
didn
’
t
turn
out
to
be
b.1.1.7
.
but
now
,
says
lee
,
in
places
like
florida
and
southern
california
,
all
the
s
gene
dropouts
are
b.1.1.7
.
it
’
s
no
longer
feasible
to
sequence
them
all
,
because
there
are
just
too
many—at
least
in
those
two
locations
,
which
represent
about
50
percent
of
the
tests
helix
conducts
.
“
in
florida
,
we
’
re
seeing
b.1.1.7
now
representing
about
15
percent
of
all
new
covid-19
cases
,
”
says
lee
.
“
six
weeks
ago
,
it
was
less
than
1
percent.
”
the
florida
department
of
health
did
not
respond
to
wired
’
s
questions
.
but
the
fate
of
that
state
over
the
next
few
weeks
may
be
a
bellwether
of
what
’
s
to
come
for
the
rest
of
the
us
.
according
to
the
cdc
,
b.1.1.7
prevalence
is
still
low—approaching
1
percent—across
the
country
.
but
helix
’
s
data
suggests
other
hot
spots
are
beginning
to
emerge
,
including
in
georgia
,
texas
,
and
pennsylvania
.
that
means
the
decisions
government
officials
in
those
areas
make
in
the
coming
days
and
weeks
regarding
reopening
schools
and
businesses
will
be
critical
.
actions
to
slow
the
spread
of
more
contagious
variants
are
most
effective
during
the
earliest
phases
of
circulation.
“
because
we
’
ve
detected
this
early
,
that
gives
us
precious
time
to
try
to
bring
down
current
levels
of
transmission
and
vaccinate
as
many
people
as
possible
,
”
says
gangavarapu
.
those
two
metrics
,
he
says
,
are
what
will
dictate
whether
or
not
the
us
sees
a
big
spike
due
to
the
new
lineages
.
“
it
’
s
a
race
against
time
,
”
he
continues
.
“
if
we
don
’
t
do
those
things
,
an
even
bigger
wave
than
what
we
saw
this
winter
is
possible
.
if
you
open
up
everything
right
now
,
that
’
s
almost
guaranteed
to
happen.
”
gangavarapu
says
his
team
of
collaborators
has
found
plenty
of
b.1.1.7
in
circulation
.
but
so
far
,
their
sequencing
efforts
haven
’
t
captured
either
of
the
two
variants
that
are
suspected
to
be
the
best
immune
evasion
artists—the
b.1.351
and
p.1
variants
,
discovered
in
south
africa
and
brazil
,
respectively
.
according
to
cdc
data
,
only
a
handful
of
those
have
been
reported
in
the
us
so
far
,
mostly
in
people
who
recently
returned
from
traveling
.
but
imports
aren
’
t
the
only
thing
to
worry
about
.
there
are
homegrown
variants
too.jeremy
kamil
is
one
of
the
people
looking
for
them
.
a
virologist
at
louisiana
state
university
health
sciences
center
shreveport
,
kamil
normally
studies
the
cytomegalovirus
family
,
but
starting
last
spring
,
he
combined
forces
with
vaughn
cooper
,
the
director
of
the
center
for
evolutionary
biology
and
medicine
at
the
university
of
pittsburgh
who
runs
a
microbial
sequencing
startup
,
to
set
up
genomic
surveillance
for
sars-cov-2
in
louisiana
.
for
months
,
they
sequenced
hundreds
of
samples
from
coronavirus
tests
randomly
collected
from
around
the
state
,
watching
for
anything
unusual
.
on
january
27
,
kamil
noticed
exactly
that—a
batch
of
samples
that
all
contained
a
mutation
he
hadn
’
t
seen
before
.
when
he
looked
closer
,
he
saw
that
each
of
the
mutant
viruses
were
closely
related—they
all
belonged
to
the
same
genetic
lineage
.
and
though
that
lineage
was
quite
young
,
dating
back
only
to
the
beginning
of
december
in
his
data
,
it
was
growing
more
common
every
day.kamil
uploaded
the
genomes
to
an
online
database
called
gisaid
,
used
by
researchers
around
the
world
.
the
next
day
,
scientists
at
the
university
of
new
mexico
contacted
him
.
they
had
found
the
same
variant
in
their
state
.
meanwhile
,
cooper
was
scouring
the
database
looking
for
more
viruses
with
the
same
mutation—a
genetic
alteration
which
changes
the
677th
amino
acid
in
the
coronavirus
’
s
spike
protein
.
he
found
more
,
and
not
just
in
louisiana
and
new
mexico
,
but
also
north
carolina
,
massachusetts
,
and
eight
other
states
.
the
researchers
realized
they
needed
a
phylogenist
to
get
their
viral
family
tree
in
order
,
so
they
enlisted
the
help
of
emma
hodcroft
at
the
university
of
bern
in
switzerland
.
within
a
week
,
her
team
had
traced
the
emergence
of
seven
new
variants
in
the
us
,
each
of
which
had
evolved
the
same
mutation
independently.the
researchers
described
this
pattern
as
an
example
of
“
convergent
evolution
”
in
a
preprint
posted
sunday
.
“
it
’
s
a
pretty
strong
indication
of
an
adaptation
,
even
if
we
don
’
t
yet
know
what
that
adaptation
is
,
”
says
cooper
,
a
coauthor
of
the
study
,
which
has
not
yet
been
peer-reviewed.we
tend
to
use
the
singular
word
“
coronavirus
”
when
referring
to
the
bug
that
causes
covid-19
.
but
a
more
accurate
way
to
think
about
sars-cov-2
is
as
a
population
of
viruses
.
and
that
population
is
in
a
state
of
constant
flux—expanding
and
contracting
,
mutating
,
and
evolving
new
lineages
as
it
spreads
from
person
to
person
.
genetic
epidemiologists
can
track
those
minute
changes
,
following
them
like
the
branches
of
a
family
tree
to
identify
clusters
of
cases
all
linked
to
one
another
.
with
enough
viral
genomes
,
they
can
also
zoom
out
to
compare
how
fast
different
branches
are
growing
.
if
one
branch
starts
to
take
off
,
it
can
indicate
that
the
genetic
changes
those
viruses
have
acquired
provide
some
kind
of
competitive
advantage
.
and
if
a
bunch
of
different
branches
independently
acquire
the
same
mutation
,
and
they
all
start
to
take
off
,
well
,
that
’
s
convergent
evolution.though
the
seven
variants
identified
by
cooper
,
kamil
,
hodcroft
,
and
company
appear
to
have
become
more
common
in
recent
months—accounting
for
up
to
15
percent
of
the
transmission
in
some
places
where
they
have
been
found—there
’
s
still
much
the
researchers
don
’
t
understand
about
them
.
where
did
they
first
emerge
?
are
they
spreading
faster
because
the
677
mutation
changes
the
virus
’
s
behavior
,
as
is
the
case
with
the
other
major
variants
of
concern
first
detected
abroad
?
or
did
holiday
travel
and
family
gatherings
in
the
us
spread
it
farther
and
faster
than
other
domestic
strains
?
even
basic
questions
about
the
real
prevalence
of
each
new
variant
are
hard
to
answer
,
because
the
nation
is
still
so
far
behind
on
sequencing.
“
what
we
’
ve
discovered
is
just
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
,
”
says
cooper
.
currently
the
us
has
sequenced
the
genomes
of
just
0.4
percent
of
all
coronavirus
cases
,
according
to
a
wired
analysis
of
gisaid
data
.
by
comparison
,
the
uk
is
doing
about
10
percent
.
denmark
,
the
world
leader
,
has
surpassed
the
50
percent
mark.the
good
news
is
that
all
the
sequencing
being
done
elsewhere
in
the
world
is
finding
that
the
virus
keeps
settling
on
the
same
genetic
changes
in
its
hunt
for
an
advantage
.
that
suggests
it
has
chanced
upon
a
run
of
good
cards
,
but
there
might
not
be
many
better
ones
left
in
the
deck
.
“
in
that
sense
,
”
says
cooper
,
“
convergence
is
actually
our
friend
here
,
because
it
limits
the
roster
of
mutations
we
have
to
pay
attention
to.
”
that
’
s
not
just
good
for
surveillance
and
testing
,
but
also
for
vaccine
makers
trying
to
future-proof
their
shots
.
any
constraints
on
the
number
and
placement
of
useful
mutations
should
make
it
easier
to
develop
an
arsenal
of
boosters
that
will
be
effective
against
whatever
variants
are
yet
to
emerge.but
that
doesn
’
t
change
the
fact
that
the
us
is
still
disastrously
unprepared
to
spot
them
when
they
do
.
as
wired
has
previously
reported
,
scaling
up
a
national
sars-cov-2
monitoring
network
involves
coordinating
a
patchwork
of
players—academics
like
kamil
and
gangavarapu
,
industry
players
like
helix
,
and
labs
on
the
front
lines
,
operated
by
public
health
departments
and
hospitals
.
connecting
sequencing
facilities
to
patient
samples
and
data
requires
coordination—both
in
terms
of
logistics
and
of
agreeing
to
do
things
in
a
standardized
way.all
of
that
takes
time
and
money
.
each
viral
sequence
costs
between
$
25
and
$
400
to
generate
.
so
far
,
the
cdc
has
funded
seven
universities
to
the
tune
of
$
14.5
million
;
signed
contracts
with
illumina
,
helix
,
and
medical
testing
behemoths
labcorp
and
quest
diagnostics
for
$
12.5
million
;
and
released
a
further
$
15
million
to
public
health
labs
.
but
this
week
,
the
biden
administration
announced
it
is
providing
a
much
needed
infusion
of
cash—almost
$
200
million—intended
to
ramp
up
the
nation
’
s
sequencing
capacity
from
7,000
to
25,000
samples
per
week
.
that
would
put
the
us
on
track
to
capture
about
5
percent
of
new
coronavirus
cases
,
provided
they
continue
to
decline
.
it
’
s
a
threshold
scientists
at
illumina
estimate
the
country
needs
to
hit
in
order
to
detect
a
new
variant
before
it
grows
to
more
than
1
percent
of
total
cases.a
spokesperson
for
the
cdc
declined
to
say
whether
the
agency
was
setting
specific
targets
.
“
there
is
currently
no
consensus
in
the

or
globally
on
the
optimal

coauthor

from

center
for

,
outlining

for
what
an
effective
sars-cov-2

program
should
look
like
.
in
the
short
term
,
she
says
,
labs
need
money
to
buy
reagents
and
sequencers
,
and
to
hire
and
train
personnel
to
run
them
.
that
includes
building
up
a
bioinformatics
workforce
in
public
health
labs—people
who
can
sort
,
clean
,
and
interpret
the
reams
of
genomic
data
produced
by
surveillance
sequencing.
“
the
much
bigger
barrier
is
the
informatics
side
,
”
says
warmbrod
.
in
addition
to
people
,
that
also
means
computational
firepower
.
she
and
her
colleagues
suggest
that
cpu-strapped
public
health
departments
could
partner
with
the
department
of
energy
,
which
operates
supercomputers
around
the
country
,
to
process
increasing
loads
of
genomic
data
.
“
we
have
the
capacity
and
the
expertise
in
this
country
,
”
she
says
.
“
we
just
need
to
incentivize
it
and
put
resources
where
it
’
ll
be
most
efficient.
”
she
and
her
colleagues
recommend
that
funds
should
go
toward
coordinating
the
characterization
of
variants—which
ones
should
be
studied
and
what
experiments
scientists
should
perform
.
right
now
,
the
old
standards
of
science
are
still
largely
being
applied
.
whoever
discovers
a
variant
gets
to
hold
onto
it
and
study
it
.
but
when
those
discoveries
could
have
such
a
huge
effect
on
human
health
,
warmbrod
argues
,
the
government
might
want
to
step
in
to
make
sure
studies
are
being
done
swiftly
,
safely
,
and
in
the
public
eye
.
in
the
longer
term
,
she
also
believes
the
us
should
invest
some
of
those
congressional
funds
in
a
national
pandemic
prediction
agency
to
safeguard
against
emerging
threats
even
after
the
covid
crisis
subsides.but
for
now
,
building
up
sequencing
capacity
in
whatever
way
gets
it
done
the
fastest
should
be
the
highest
priority
,
says
warmbrod
.
“
we
know
variants
are
here
.
we
know
they
’
re
going
to
keep
coming
as
long
as
there
’
s
transmission
.
these
variants
could
pop
up
anywhere
,
”
she
says
.
“
and
right
now
,
in
most
places
in
the
country
,
a
new
variant
could
be
popping
up
in
your
backyard
,
and
we
’
d
have
no
idea
because
we
can

does
it

positive
for
covid-19
?
when
you
receive

covid-19
test
,
it
comes
back
either
positive
or
negative
.
but
some
experts
say
we
’

benefit
from
developing
a
more
nuanced
approach
that
takes
into
account
the
sensitivity
of
different
kinds
of
tests
and
how
much
virus
they
detect
.
even
the
way
labs
analyze
tests
can
have
an
impact
on
your
results
:
not
all
of
them
use
the
same
thresholds
for
figuring
out
if
a
sample
is
positive
for
the
presence
of
the
virus
.
and
a
patient
’
s
viral
load
rises
and
falls
over
the
course
of
a
few
days
,
which
means
some
people
who
receive
positive
tests
may
actually
be
nearing
the
end
of
their
illness
,
and
some
who
receive
negative
results
may
in

have
the
virus

the

administration
investigates
the
contested
origins

the

neither
strengthens
nor
discounts
the
hypothesis
that
the

leaked
out
of
a
famous
wuhan
lab
.
but
it
does
raise
questions
about
why
original
sequences
were
deleted
,
and
suggests
that
there
may
be
more
revelations
to
recover
from
the
far
corners
of
the
internet.
“
this
is
a
great
piece
of
sleuth
work
for
sure
,
and
it
significantly
advances
efforts
to
understand
the

wrote
the

called
the
deletion
of

it
“
seems
likely

bloom
and
dr.
worobey
belong
to
an
outspoken
group
of
scientists
who
have
called
for
more
research
into
how
the
pandemic
began
.
in
a
letter
published
in
may
,
they
complained
that
there
wasn
’
t
enough
information
to
determine
whether
it
was
more
likely
that
a
lab
leak
spread
the
coronavirus
,
or
that
it
leapt
to
humans
from
contact
with
an
infected
animal
outside
of
a
lab.the
genetic
sequences
of
viral
samples
hold
crucial
clues
about
how
sars-cov-2
shifted
to
our
species
from
another
animal
,
most
likely
a
bat
.
most
precious
of
all
are
sequences
from
early
in
the
pandemic
,
because
they
take
scientists
closer
to
the
original
spillover
event.as
dr.
bloom
was
reviewing
what
genetic
data
had
been
published
by
various
research
groups
,
he
came
across
a
march
2020
study
with
a
spreadsheet
that
included
information
on
241
genetic
sequences
collected
by
scientists
at
wuhan
university
.
the
spreadsheet
indicated
that
the
scientists
had
uploaded
the
sequences
to
an
online
database
called
the

,
managed
by
the
u.s.
government
’
s
national
library
of

when
dr.
bloom
looked
for
the
wuhan
sequences
in
the
database
earlier
this
month
,
his
only
result
was
“
no
item
found.
”
puzzled
,
he
went
back
to
the
spreadsheet
for
any
further
clues
.
it
indicated
that
the
241
sequences
had
been
collected
by
a
scientist
named
aisi
fu
at
renmin
hospital
in
wuhan
.
searching
medical
literature
,
dr.
bloom
eventually
found
another
study
posted
online
in
march
2020
by
dr.
fu
and
colleagues
,
describing
a
new
experimental
test
for
sars-cov-2
.
the
chinese
scientists
published
it
in
a
scientific
journal
three
months
later.in
that
study
,
the
scientists
wrote
that
they
had
looked
at
45
samples
from
nasal
swabs
taken
“
from
outpatients
with
suspected
covid-19
early
in
the
epidemic.
”
they
then
searched
for
a
portion
of
sars-cov-2
’
s
genetic
material
in
the
swabs
.
the
researchers
did
not
publish
the
actual
sequences
of
the
genes
they
fished
out
of
the
samples
.
instead
,
they
only
published
some
mutations
in
the
viruses.but
a
number
of
clues
indicated
to
dr.
bloom
that
the
samples
were
the
source
of
the
241
missing
sequences
.
the
papers
included
no
explanation
as
to
why
the
sequences
had
been
uploaded
to
the
sequence
read
archive
,
only
to
disappear
later.perusing
the
archive
,
dr.
bloom
figured
out
that
many
of
the
sequences
were
stored
as
files
on
google
cloud
.
each
sequence
was
contained
in
a
file
in
the
cloud
,
and
the
names
of
the
files
all
shared
the
same
basic
format
,
he
reported.dr
.
bloom
swapped
in
the
code
for
a
missing
sequence
from
wuhan
.
suddenly
,
he
had
the
sequence
.
all
told
,
he
managed
to
recover
13
sequences
from
the
cloud
this
way.with
this
new
data
,
dr.
bloom
looked
back
once
more
at
the
early
stages
of
the
pandemic
.
he
combined
the
13
sequences
with
other
published
sequences
of
early
coronaviruses
,
hoping
to
make
progress
on
building
the
family
tree
of
sars-cov-2.working
out
all
the
steps
by
which
sars-cov-2
evolved
from
a
bat
virus
has
been
a
challenge
because
scientists
still
have
a
limited
number
of
samples
to
study
.
some
of
the
earliest
samples
come
from
the
huanan
seafood
wholesale
market
in
wuhan
,
where
an
outbreak
occurred
in
december
2019.but
those
market
viruses
actually
have
three
extra
mutations
that
are
missing
from
sars-cov-2
samples
collected
weeks
later
.
in
other
words
,
those
later
viruses
look
more
like
coronaviruses
found
in
bats
,
supporting
the
idea
that
there
was
some
early
lineage
of
the
virus
that
did
not
pass
through
the
seafood
market.dr
.
bloom
found
that
the
deleted
sequences
he
recovered
from
the
cloud
also
lack
those
extra
mutations
.
“
they
’
re
three
steps
more
similar
to
the
bat
coronaviruses
than
the
viruses
from
the
huanan
fish
market
,
”
dr.
bloom
said.this
suggests
,
he
said
,
that
by
the
time
sars-cov-2
reached
the
market
,
it
had
been
circulating
for
awhile
in
wuhan
or
beyond
.
the
market
viruses
,
he
argued
,
aren
’
t
representative
of
full
diversity
of
coronaviruses
already
loose
in
late
2019.
“
maybe
our
picture
of
what
was
present
early
in
wuhan
from
what
has
been
sequenced
might
be
somewhat
biased
,
”
he
said.in
his
report
,
dr.
bloom
acknowledged
that
this
conclusion
would
have
to
be
confirmed
with
a
deeper
analysis
of
the
virus
sequences
.
dr.
worobey
said
that
he
and
his
colleagues
are
working
on
a
large-scale
study
of
sars-cov-2
genes
to
better
understand
its
origin
and
that
they

now

“
these
additional

will
play
a
big
role
in

”
dr.

said.it
’

not
clear
why
this
valuable

the
national

that

removed
last
summer.
“
these
sars-cov-2

,
a

said
that
the

dr.

has
searched

has

to
find
them

“
obviously

can

rule
out

looked

”
he
said.three
of
the
co-authors
of
the
2020
testing
study
that
produced
the
13
sequences
did
not
immediately
respond
to
emails
inquiring
about

that

co-author
,
dr.

,
who
was
also
named
on
the
spreadsheet
from
the

scientists
are
skeptical
that
there
is
anything
sinister
behind
the
removal
of
the
sequences
.
“
i
don
’
t
really
understand
how
this
points
to
a
cover-up
,
”
said
stephen
goldstein
,
a
virologist
at
the
university
of
utah.dr
.
goldstein
noted
that
the
testing
paper
listed
the
individual
mutations
the
wuhan
researchers
found
in
their
tests
.
although
the
full
sequences
are
no
longer
in
the
archive
,
the
key
information
has
been
public
for
over
a
year
,
he
said
.
it
was
just
tucked
away
in
a
format
that
is
hard
for
researchers
to
find.
“
we
all
missed
this
relatively
obscure
paper

”
dr.
goldstein
said.
“
you
can
’
t
really
say
why
they
were
removed
,
”
dr.
bloom
acknowledged
in
an
interview
.
“
you
can
say
that
the
practical
consequence
of
removing
them
was
that
people
didn
’
t
notice
they
existed.
”
he
also
noted
that
the
chinese
government
ordered
the
destruction
of
a
number
of
early
samples
of
the
virus
and
barred
the
publication
of
papers
on
the
coronavirus
without
its
approval.for
his
part
,
dr.
worobey
still
wants
answers
.
“
i
hope
we
hear
from
the
authors
who
generated
,
but
then
deleted
,
these
crucial
sequences
so
we
can
understand
more
about
their
motivation
for
doing
so
,
”
he
said
.
“
it
certainly
is
strange
at
face
value
and
really
demands
an
explanation.
”
regardless
of
what
happened
to
these
13
sequences
,
dr.
bloom
now
wonders
what
other
clues
might
be
discovered
online
.
in
order
to
reconstruct
the
origin
of
covid-19
,
all
those
clues
potentially
matter.
“
ideally
,
we
need
to
try
to
find
as
many
other
early
sequences
as
possible
,
”
he
said
.
“
and
i
think
this
study
suggests
that
we
should
look
everywhere.
”
the
super-contagious
delta
variant
of

is
now
responsible
for
about
one
in

five
covid-19

it

appearance
in

is
not
surprising

and
with

ticking
up
and

falling
,
it
’

unclear
how
much
of

cause
here

still
,
its
swift
rise
has
prompted
concerns
that
it
might
jeopardize
the

progress
in
beating
back
the

“
the
delta

is
currently
the
greatest

”
dr.
anthony
s.
fauci
,
the

leading
infectious
disease
expert
,
said
at
the
briefing
.
the
good
news
,
he
said
,
is
that
the
vaccines
authorized
in
the
united

work
against
the
variant
.
“
we
have
the
tools

”
he
said

“
so
let

use
them

and
crush

”
here
are
answers
to
some
common
questions
about
the
delta
variant.delta
,
formerly
known
as
b.1.617.2
,
is
believed
to
be
the
most
transmissible
variant
yet
,
spreading
more
easily
than
both
the
original
strain
of
the
virus
and
the
alpha
variant
first
identified
in
britain
.
public
health
officials
there
have
said
that
delta
could
be
50
percent
more
contagious
than
alpha
,
though
precise
estimates
of
its
infectiousness
vary.other
evidence
suggests
that
the
variant
may
be
able
to
partially
evade
the
antibodies
made
by
the
body
after
a
coronavirus
infection
or
vaccination
.
and
the
variant
may
also
render
certain
monoclonal
antibody
treatments
less
effective
,
the
c.d.c
.
notes.delta
may
also
cause
more
severe
illness
.
a
recent
scottish
study
,
for
instance
,
found
that
people
infected
by
the
delta
variant
were
roughly
twice
as
likely
to
be
hospitalized
than
were
those
infected
with
alpha
.
but
uncertainties
remain
,
scientists
said.
“
the
severe
disease
piece
i
think
is
the
one
question
that
really
hasn
’
t
been
answered
yet
,
”
said
dr.
michael
osterholm
,
director
of
the
center
for
infectious
disease
research
and
policy
at
the
university
of
minnesota.delta
has
been
reported
in
80
countries
.
it
is
now
the
most
common
variant
in
india
and
britain
,
where
it
accounts
for
more
than
90
percent
of
cases.delta
was
first
identified
in
the
united
states
in
march
.
although
alpha
remains
the
most
prevalent
variant
here
,
delta
has
spread
quickly
.
in
early
april
,
delta
represented
just
0.1
percent
of
cases
in
the
united
states
,
according
to
the
c.d.c
.
by
early
may
,
the
variant
accounted
for
1.3
percent
of
cases
,
and
by
early
june
,
that
figure
had
jumped
to
9.5
percent
.
as
of
a
few
days
ago
,
the
estimate
hit
20.6
percent
,
dr.
fauci
said
at
the
briefing.the
delta
variant
is
unlikely
to
pose
much
risk
to
people
who
have
been
fully
vaccinated
,
experts
said.
“
if
you
’
re
fully
vaccinated
,
i
would
largely
not
worry
about
it
,
”
said
dr.
ashish
k.
jha
,
dean
of
the
brown
university
school
of
public
health.according
to
one
recent
study
,
the
pfizer-biontech
vaccine
was
88
percent
effective
at
protecting
against
symptomatic
disease
caused
by
delta
,
nearly
matching
its
93
percent
effectiveness
against
the
alpha
variant
.
but
a
single
dose
of
the
vaccine
was
just
33
percent
effective
against
delta
,
the
study
found.
“
fully
immunized
individuals
should
do
well
with
this
new
phase
of
the
epidemic
,
”
said
dr.
peter
hotez
,
dean
of
the
national
school
of
tropical
medicine
at
baylor
college
of
medicine
.
“
however
,
the
protection
offered
by
a
single
dose
appears
low
,
and
of
course
if
you
are
not
at
all
vaccinated
,
consider
yourself
at
high
risk.
”
delta
is
likely
to
infect
“
large
numbers
”
of
unvaccinated
people
,
he
said.the
pandemic
is
waning
in
the
united
states
,
with
cases
,
hospitalizations
and
deaths
all
on
the
decline
.
the
seven-day

,
is
the
lowest
since

2020
,
dr.
rochelle
walensky
,
director
of
the
c.d.c.
,
said
at
the
briefing
on
tuesday
.
“
these
numbers
demonstrate
the
extraordinary
progress
we
’

made
against
a
formidable
foe
,
”
she
said.so
while
delta
may
account
for
an
increasing
percentage
of
cases
,
it
is
not
yet
clear
whether
it
will
drive
the
total
number
of
cases
higher.
“
i
think
we
are
not
going
to
see
another
big
,
national
surge
in
the
united
states
because
we
have
enough
vaccination
to
prevent
that
,
”
dr.
osterholm
said.still
,
vaccination
rates
have
been
highly
uneven
,
and
are
lower
in
certain
states
and
demographic
groups
.
delta
could
fuel
outbreaks
in
the
south
,
where
vaccinations
lag
,
or
among
young
people
,
who
are
less
likely
to
be
vaccinated
than
their
elders.
“
in
places
where
there
’
s
still
a
lot
of
susceptibility
to
the
virus
,
it
opens
a
window
for
cases
to
start
going
up
again
,
”
said
justin
lessler
,
an
infectious
disease
epidemiologist
at
johns
hopkins
university
.
“
but
even
in
those
states
,
and
certainly
nationally
,
we
’
re
probably
not
getting
back
to
the
numbers
we
were
seeing
last
winter.
”
still
,
he
said
,
it

”
at
a
senate
hearing
on
efforts
to
combat
covid-19
last
month
,
senator
rand
paul
of
kentucky
asked
dr.
anthony
s.
fauci
whether
the
national
institutes
of
health
had
funded
“
gain-of-function
”
research
on
coronaviruses
in
china.
“
gain-of-function
research
,
as
you
know
,
is
juicing
up
naturally
occurring
animal
viruses
to
infect
humans
,
”
the
senator
said.dr
.
fauci
,
the
nation
’
s
top
infectious
disease
expert
,
flatly
rejected
the
claim
:
“
senator
paul
,
with
all
due
respect
,
you
are
entirely
and
completely
incorrect
,
that
the
n.i.h
.
has
not
ever
and
does
not
now
fund
gain-of-function
research
in
the
wuhan
institute.
”
this
exchange
,
and
the
bit
of
scientific
jargon
at
the
heart
of
it
,
has
gained
traction
in
recent
weeks
,
usually
by
people
suggesting
that
the
coronavirus
was
engineered
,
rather
than
having
jumped
from
animals
to
humans
,
the
explanation
favored
by
most
experts
on
coronaviruses
.
the
uproar
has
also
drawn
attention
back
to
a
decade-long
debate
among
scientists
over
whether
certain
gain-of-function
research
is
too
risky
to
allow.spurred
by
some
contested
bird
flu
experiments
in
2012
,
the
u.s.
government
adjusted
its
policies
for
oversight
of
certain
types
of
pathogen
studies
.
but
some
critics
in
the
scientific
community
say
that
the
policy
is
overly
restrictive
and
that
its
enforcement
has
been
far
from
transparent.the
stakes
of
the
debate
could
not
be
higher
.
too
little
research
on
emerging
viruses
will
leave
us
unprepared
for
future
pandemics
.
but
too
little
attention
to
the
safety
risks
will
increase
the
chances
that
an
experimental
pathogen
may
escape
a
lab
through
an
accident
and
cause
an
outbreak
of
its
own.sorting
out
the
balance
of
risks
and
benefits
of
the
research
has
proved
over
the
years
to
be
immensely
challenging
.
and
now
,
the
intensity
of
the
politics
and
rhetoric
over
the
lab
leak
theory
threatens
to
push
detailed
science
policy
discussions
to
the
sidelines.
“
it
’
s
just
going
to
make
it
harder
to
get
back
to
a
serious
debate

”
said
marc
lipsitch
,
an
epidemiologist
at
the
harvard
t.h

chan
school
of
public
health
who
has
urged
the
government
to
be
more
transparent
about
its
support
of
gain-of-function
research.in
the
1970s
,
researchers
were
learning
for
the
first
time
to
move
genes
from
one
organism
to
another
to
make
bacteria
produce
human
insulin
.
from
the
start
,
critics
worried
that
such
experiments
could
accidentally
create
deadly
pathogens
if
they
escaped
from
labs.tinkering
with
genes
isn
’
t
the
only
way
that
a
scientist
can
give
an
organism
new
abilities
.
researchers
can
also
stage
evolutionary
experiments
,
in
which
pathogens
are
grown
in
the
cells
of
an
unfamiliar
host
species
.
at
first
,
they
don
’
t
replicate
well
.
but
new
mutations
can
help
them
adapt
,
gradually
improving
their
performance.a
decade
ago
,
researchers
used
serial
passage
,
as
this
procedure
is
known
,
to
learn
how
new
strains
of
influenza
evolve
.
flu
strains
start
off
in
the
guts
of
birds
,
and
sometimes
manage
to
mutate
into
a
form
that
can
spread
among
people.two
teams
of
researchers
—
one
from
the
university
of
wisconsin
in
madison
and
the
other
at
erasmus
medical
center
in
rotterdam
,
the
netherlands
—
designed
experiments
to
identify
which
genetic
mutations
were
essential
for
a
successful
jump
from
birds
to
people
.
they
injected
bird
flu
viruses
into
the
noses
of
ferrets
,
waited
for
the
viruses
to
replicate
,
and
then
transferred
the
new
viruses
to
new
ferrets
.
soon
the
viruses
evolved
to
become
better
at
replicating
in
the
ferrets.when
news
of
the
experiments
broke
in
late
2011
,
a
controversy
exploded
.
some
critics
said
the
research
was
reckless
and
shouldn
’
t
be
published
,
for
fear
that
other
researchers
would
copy
the
work
and
accidentally
release
a
new
pandemic
strain
of
flu.a
year
later
,
the
u.s.
department
of
health
and
human
services
held
a
meeting
to
consider
what
it
called
“
gain-of-function
research.
”
the
name
took
hold
,
but
scientific
experts
have
grown
increasingly
frustrated
with
it
ever
since.
“
it
’
s
a
horribly
imprecise
term
,
”
said
gigi
gronvall
,
a
senior
scholar
at
the
johns
hopkins
center
for
health
security.many
gain-of-function
experiments
could
never
pose
an
existential
threat
;
instead
,
they
have
provided
huge
benefits
to
humanity
.
in
1937
,
researchers
found
that
when
they
passed
the
yellow
fever
virus
through
chicken
cells
,
it
lost
the
ability
to
cause
disease
in
humans
—
a
discovery
that
led
to
a
vaccine
for
yellow
fever
.
likewise
,
herpes
viruses
have
been
engineered
to
gain
a
new
function
of
their
own
:
attacking
cancer
cells
.
they
’
re
now
an
approved
treatment
for
melanoma.but
the
bird
flu
experiments
raised
concerns
that
certain
gain-of-function
studies
could
pose
a
tiny
but
real
risk
of
dangerous
outbreaks
.
in
2014
,
u.s.
officials
announced
that
18
such
studies
would
be
paused
.
the
experiments
were
not
just
on
influenza
viruses
,
but
on
the
coronaviruses
that
caused
sars
and
mers.three
years
later
,
the
government
rolled
out
a
new
policy
—
the
“
p3co
framework
”
—
for
research
on
“
enhanced
potential
pandemic
pathogens.
”
the
rule
requires
the
agencies
under
the
h.h.s

umbrella
,
like
n.i.h
.
and
its
several
institutes
,
to
carry
out
a
special
review
of
grant
applications
for
any
research
on
“
a
credible
source
of
a
potential
future
human
pandemic.
”
in
2019
,
after
conducting
such
a
scientific
review
,
the
agency
gave
the
green
light
for
two
influenza
projects
to
restart
,
triggering
more
debate
about
whether
its
policy
was
thorough
enough.when
questioning
dr.
fauci
last
month
,
senator
paul
brought
up
one
of
the
most
cited
examples
of
gain-of-function
research
,
a
study
of
coronaviruses
done
by
ralph
baric
at
the
university
of
north
carolina
published
in
nature
medicine
in
2015
.
working
with
data
sent
from
shi
zhengli
,
the
director
of
the
wuhan
institute
of
virology
,
dr.
baric
and
his
colleagues
built
a
new
coronavirus
from
an
existing
one
.
all
of
the
work
was
done
in
the
north
carolina
lab
,
and
neither
dr.
shi
nor
members
of
her
lab
participated.the
so-called
chimeric
virus
that
resulted
was
not
more
pathogenic
than
the
parental
virus
,
dr.
baric
said
.
“
this
work
was
approved
by
the
n.i.h
..
,
was
peer-reviewed
,
p3co
reviewed
and
approved
,
”
dr.
baric
wrote
in
an
email
last
month
.
the
work
also
“
involved
a
very
different
strain
of
beta
coronavirus
than
the
one
that
causes
covid-19
,
”
he
said
,
and
was
considered
low
risk
because
of
the
particular
strain
in
question.in
the
paper
,
he
and
his
colleagues
cautioned
others
about
similar
research
.
“
the
potential
to
prepare
for
and
mitigate
future
outbreaks
must
be
weighed
against
the
risk
of
creating
more
dangerous

,
”
they
wrote.the
p3co
policy
has
a
significant
shortcoming
,
according
to
david
relman
,
a
member
of
the
u.s.
national
science
advisory
board
for
biosecurity
and
a
microbiologist
at
stanford
university
:

grants
from
the
national
science
foundation
,
the
pentagon
or
other
agencies
could
include
dangerous
research
and
also
need
oversight
,
he
said
.
then
there
is
the
even
thornier
question
of
private
research
,
not
funded
by
the
government.dr
.
relman
has
also
criticized
the
government
’
s
process
for
screening
and
approving
gain-of-function
research
.
at
a
january
2020
meeting
of
the
advisory
board
,
he
objected
to
the
lack
of
information
released
about
how
two
research
proposals
were
approved.rozanne
sandri-golin
,
editor
in

of

,
a
scientist
who
works
on
the
herpes

and
a
fellow
member
of
the
board
,
said
dr.
relman
made
a
strong
case
about
the
lack
of
transparency
in
the
grant-screening
process
.
the
board
was
told
that
a
committee
made
the
decision
but
“
their
names
weren
’
t
published
,
their
backgrounds
weren
’
t
published
and
the
process
that
they
used
for
deciding
whether
or
not
it
was
going
to
be
all
right
to
now
proceed
with
this
research
was
not
clearly
defined
,
”
she
said.the
secrecy
of
the
screening
process
was
the
most
worrisome
part
of
government
oversight
of
potentially
dangerous
research
,
according
to
angela
rasmussen
,
a
virologist
at
university
of
saskatchewan
’

vaccine
and
infectious
disease
organization
,
who
was
doing
research
in
the
united

at
that
time
.
“
it

not
clear
how
they
decide
what

and
what
’
s
not

”
she
said.however
,
the
“

”
nature
of
the
process
was
not
its
biggest
problem
,
said
richard
ebright
,
a
molecular
biologist
at
rutgers
who
has
also
been
one
of
the
most
vocal
proponents
of
the
lab
leak
theory
,
and
a
longtime
advocate
of
stricter
control
of
research
on
dangerous
pathogens
.
an
even
bigger
issue
,
he
said
,
was
that
gain-of-function
research
was
simply
not
being
screened
in
accordance
with
the
policy
established
by
h.h.s.
,
which
includes
the
national
institute
of
allergy
and
infectious
diseases
,
run
by
dr.
fauci.the
ideal
solution
,
he
said
,
would
be
the
creation
of
an
independent
body
to
provide
the
oversight
of
dangerous
pathogen
research
,
similar
to
what
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
does
for
studies
of
radioactive
materials.in
the
united
states
,
“
there
are
no
biosafety
rules
or
regulations
that
have
the
force
of
law
,
”
he
said
.
“
and
this
is
in
contrast
to
every
other
aspect
of
biomedical
research.
”
there
are
enforceable
rules
,
for
example
,
for
experiments
with
human
subjects
,
vertebrate
animals
,
radioactive
materials
and
lasers
,
but
none
for
research
with
disease-causing
organisms.dr
.
relman
,
who
also
supports
the
need
for
independent
regulation
,
cautioned
that
legal
restrictions
,
as
opposed
to
guidelines
or
more
flexible
regulations
,
could
also
pose
problems
.
“
the
law
is
cumbersome
and
slow

”
he
said
.
at
one
point
in
the
evolution
of
laws
relating
to
biological
warfare
,
for
example
,
congress
prohibited
the
possession
of
smallpox
.
but
the
rule
’
s
language
,
dr.
relman
said
,
also
seemed
to
ban
possession
of
the
vaccine
because
of
its
genetic
similarity
to
the
virus
itself
.
“
to
try
to
fix
it
took
forever
,
”
he
said.the
current
h.h.s

policy
also
doesn
’
t
offer
much
guidance
about
working
with
scientists
in
other
countries
.
some
have
different
policies
about
gain-of-function
research
,
while
others
have
none
at
all.dr
.
gronvall
of
johns
hopkins
argued
that
the
u.s.
government
can
not
dictate
what
scientists
do
in
other
parts
of
the
world
.
“
you
have
to
embrace
self-governance

”
she
said
.
“
you

to
sit

”
even
if
other
countries
fall
short
on
gain-of-function
research
policies
,
dr.

said
that
shouldn

stop
the
united

from
developing
better
ones
.
as
the
world

leader
in
biomedical
research
,
the
country
could
set
an
example
.
“
the
united

is
sufficiently
central
,
”
dr.
lipsitch
said
.
“
what
we
do
really
does
matter.
”
ironically
,
the
pandemic
put
deliberations
over
such
issues
on
hold
.
but
there
’

no
question
the
coronavirus
will
influence
the
shape
of
the
debate
.
jesse
bloom
,
a
virologist
at
the
fred
hutchinson
cancer
research
center
,
said
that
before
the
pandemic
,
the
idea
of
a
new
virus
sweeping
the
world
and
causing
millions
of
deaths
felt
hypothetically
plausible
.
now
he
has
seen
what
such
a
virus
can
do.
“
you
have
to
think
really
carefully
about
any
kind
of
research
that
could
lead
to
that
sort
of
mishap
in
the
future
,
”
dr.
bloom
said.in
december
,
british
researchers
discovered
that
a
new
variant
was
sweeping
through
their
country
.
when
it
arrived
in
other
countries
,
the
variant
,
now
known
as
alpha
,
tended
to
become
more
common
in
its
new
homes
as
well
.
by
april
,
it
had
become
the
dominant
variant
in
the
united
states
,
and
it
has
remained
so
ever
since.alpha
’
s
swift
success
has
left
scientists
wondering
how
the
variant
conquered
the
world
.
a
new
study
points
to
one
secret
to
its
success
:
alpha
disables
the
first
line
of
immune
defense
in
our
bodies
,
giving
the
variant
more
time
to
multiply.
“
it
’
s
very
impressive
,
”
said
dr.
maudry
laurent-rolle
,
a
physician
and
virologist
at
the
yale
school
of
medicine
who
was
not
involved
in
the
new
study
.
“
any
successful
virus
has
to
get
beyond
that
first
defense
system
.
the
more
successful
it
is
at
doing
that
,
the
better
off
the
virus
is.
”
the
report
was
posted
online
on
monday
and
has
not
yet
been
published
in
a
scientific
journal.alpha
has
23
mutations
that
set
it
apart
from
other
coronaviruses
.
when
the
variant
started
to
surge
in
britain
,
researchers
began
inspecting
these
genetic
tweaks
to
look
for
explanations
as
to
why
it
was
spreading
faster
than
other
variants.a
lot
of
researchers
focused
their
attention
on
the
nine
mutations
that
alter
the
so-called
spike
protein
that
covers
the
coronavirus
and
allows
it
to
invade
cells
.
one
of
those
mutations
helps
the
virus
bind
more
tightly
to
cells
,
potentially
improving
its
chances
of
a
successful
infection.but
other
scientists
have
focused
on
how
alpha
affects
the
human
immune
response
.
gregory
towers
,
a
virologist
at
the
university
college
london
,
and
his
colleagues
grew
coronaviruses
in
human
lung
cells
,
comparing
alpha-infected
cells
with
those
infected
with
earlier
variants
of
the
coronavirus.they
found
that
lung
cells
with
alpha
made
drastically
less
interferon
,
a
protein
that
switches
on
a
host
of
immune
defenses
.
they
also
found
that
in
the
alpha
cells
,
the
defensive
genes
normally
switched
on
by
interferon
were
quieter
than
in
cells
infected
with
other
variants.somehow
,
the
immune
system
’
s
most
important
alarm
bells
were
barely
ringing
in
the
presence
of
the
alpha
variant
.
“
it
’
s
making
itself
more
invisible
,
”
dr
.
towers
said.to
investigate
how
alpha
achieved
this
invisibility
,
the
researchers
looked
at
how
the
coronavirus
replicated
inside
of
infected
cells
.
they
found
that
alpha-infected
cells
make
a
lot
of
extra
copies
—
some
80
times
more
than
other
versions
of
the

—
of
a

,
a
molecular
biologist
at

san

,
and
a
co-author
of
the
new
study.in
previous
research
,
dr.
krogan
and
his
colleagues
had
found
that
orf9b
makes
a
viral
protein
that
locks
onto
a
human
protein
called
tom70
.
and
it
just
so
happens
that
tom70
is
essential
for
a
cell
’
s
release
of
interferon
in
the
face
of
an
invading
virus.putting
all
of
the
evidence
together
,
dr.
krogan
and
his
colleagues
argue
that
the
alpha
variant
carries
a
mutation
that
forces
the
production
of
a
lot
more
orf9b
proteins
.
those
proteins
swarm
the
human
tom70
proteins
,
dampening
the
production
of
interferon
and
a
full
immune
response
.
the
virus
,
protected
from
attack
,
has
better
odds
of
making
copies
of
itself.an
infected
cell
can
gradually
remove
the
orf9b
proteins
from
its
tom70
molecules
,
however
.
by
about
12
hours
after
infection
,
the
alarm
system
starts
coming
back
online

and
because
of
that
immune
response
,
dr

towers
said
,
“
all
hell
breaks
loose.
”
dr
.
towers
speculated
that
when
the
delayed
immune
response
finally
happens
,
people
infected
with
alpha
have
a
more
robust
reaction
than
they
would
with
other
variants
,
coughing
and
shedding
virus-laden
mucus
from
not
only
their
mouths
,
but
also
their
noses
—
making
alpha
even
better
at
spreading.
“
what
they
’
re
showing
makes
sense
,
”
dr.
laurent-rolle
said
.
but
she
would
like
to
see
more
lines
of
evidence
in
support
of
their
conclusion
.
for
example
,
the
scientists
did
not
run
a
standard
test
to
measure
the
number
of
orf9b
proteins.
“
that
’
s
one
thing
that
could
be
concerning
,
”
she
said
.
dr.
krogan
said
he
and
his
colleagues
were
developing
that
test
now.dr
.
krogan
’
s
team
has
also
started
similar
experiments
on
other
variants

the
variant
first
identified
in
south
africa
,
known
as
beta
,
and
the
one
first
identified
in
india
,
known
as
delta

the
preliminary
results
surprised
them.both
beta
and
delta
drive
down
interferon
in
infected
cells
.
but
there
’
s
no
sign
that
they
do
so
by
flooding
the
cells
with
orf9b
proteins
.
they
may
have
independently
evolved
their
own
tricks
for
manipulating
our
immune
system.

know
that
the
best
time
to
try
to
block
the
coronavirus
is
in
the
first
few
days
of
the
disease
,
when
the
virus
is
replicating
rapidly
and
the
immune
system
has
not
yet
mounted
a
defense.many
people
crush
their
infection
and
recuperate
,
but
in
others
,
the
immune
system
misfires
and
starts
damaging
tissues
instead
of
viruses
.
it
’
s
this
self-inflicted
damage
that
sends
many
people
with
covid-19
to
the
hospital
,
as
the
coronavirus
replication
is
tapering
off
.
so
a
drug
that
blocks
replication
early
in
an
infection
might
very
well
fail
in
a
trial
on
patients
who
have
progressed
to
later
stages
of
the
disease.so
far
,
only
one
antiviral
has
demonstrated
a
clear
benefit
to
people
in
hospitals
:
remdesivir
.
originally
investigated
as
a
potential
cure
for
ebola
,
the
drug
seems
to
shorten
the
course
of
covid-19
when
given
intravenously
to
patients
.
in
october
,
it
became
the
first
—
and
so
far
,
the
only
—
antiviral
drug
to
gain
full
f.d.a
.
approval
to
treat
the
disease.yet
remdesivir
’
s
performance
has
left
many
researchers
underwhelmed
.
in
november
,
the
world
health
organization
recommended
against
using
the
drug.remdesivir
might
work
more
effectively
if
people
could
take
it
earlier
in
the
course
of
covid-19
as
a
pill
.
but
in
its
approved
formulation
,
the
compound
doesn
’
t
work
orally
.
it
can
’
t
survive
the
passage
from
the
mouth
to
the
stomach
to
the
circulatory
system.researchers
from
around
the
world
are
testing
other
antivirals
already
known
to
work
in
pill
form
.
one
such
compound
,
called
molnupiravir
,
was
developed
in
2019
by
researchers
at
emory
university
and
has
been
tested
against
viruses
including
influenza
and
venezuelan
equine
encephalitis
virus.in
partnership
with
ridgeback
biotherapeutics
of
miami
,
the
emory
team
carried
out
experiments
in
mice
that
were
so
impressive
that
merck
approached
them
to
bring
the
drug
into
human
clinical
trials
for
covid-19.
“
we
thought
this
molecule
was
really
amazing
,
”
said
daria
hazuda
,
vice
president
of
infectious
disease
and
vaccine
research
at
merck.in
a
trial
of
hospitalized
patients
,
however
,
molnupiravir
seemed
to
have
no
effect
on
the
disease
.
in
april
,
the
companies
announced
they
were
scrapping
the
trial.
“
i
see
that
,
and
i
’
m
like
,
‘
yeah
,
no
duh
,
’
”
said
dr.
tim
sheahan
,
a
virologist
at
the
university
of
north
carolina
.
“
it
’
s
not
surprising
to
me
that
those
kinds
of
medications
would
not
make
a
dramatic
improvement
in
someone
’
s
outcome
when
they
’
ve
been
sick
for
several
days.
”
the
companies
began
a
second
study
last
fall
,
this
time
testing
the
drug
on
people
recently
diagnosed
with
covid-19
.
that
trial
is
continuing
,
and
merck
is
recruiting
volunteers
with
a
higher
risk
of
infection
,
such
as
older
people
with
obesity
and
diabetes
.
dr.
hazuda
said
the
trial
should
deliver
clear
results
by
october.last
year
,
the
government
’
s
funding
of
covid-19
treatments
focused
on
a
handful
of
candidates
,
such
as
monoclonal
antibodies
and
remdesivir
.
many
other
studies
on
antivirals
were
small
and
underfunded
.
in
january
,
the
incoming
biden
administration
began
designing
a
new
program
dedicated
to
antiviral
pills.last
week
saw
the
first
results
of
this
planning
.
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
announced
that
it
would
purchase
from
merck
1.7
million
doses
of
molnupiravir
at
a
cost
of
$
1.2
billion
,
provided
that
the
current
trial
leads
to
authorization
by
the
food
and
drug
administration
.
the
government
may
seek
similar
deals
for
two
other
antivirals
far
along
in
clinical
trials
,
according
to
dr.
david
kessler
,
the
chief
science
officer
of
the
biden
administration
’
s
covid-19
response
team.the
hope
“
is
that
we
can
get
an
antiviral
by
the
end
of
the
fall
that
can
help
us
close
out
this
chapter
of
the
epidemic
,
”
dr.
kessler
said
in
an
interview.one
of
the
drugs
the
government
is
considering
is
at-527
,
developed
by
atea
pharmaceuticals
.
the
compound
has
already
proven
safe
and
effective
as
a
treatment
for
hepatitis
c
,
and
early
studies
suggested
it
might
also
work
against
covid-19
.
roche
has
partnered
with
atea
to
test
it
in
people
,
and
the
companies
are
currently
running
a
late-stage
clinical
trial.the
other
drug
on
the
government
’
s
radar
was
created
by
scientists
at
pfizer
,
adapted
from
a
molecule
initially
designed
in
the
early
2000s
as
a
potential
drug
for
sars
.
that
drug
had
sat
on
the
shelf
for
years
,
but
last
spring
,
the
scientists
decided
to
modify
its
structure
so
that
it
would
work
against
the
new
coronavirus
’
s
protease
.
more
than
200
pfizer
researchers
joined
forces
on
the
effort
on
the
molecule
,
known
for
now
as
pf-07321332.the
drug
had
been
designed
to
be
taken
intravenously
,
but
the
pfizer
researchers
succeeded
in
altering
its
structure
to
work
as
a
pill
.
when
mice
were
given
the
drug
orally
,
it
reached
high
enough
levels
in
the
body
to
block
the
coronavirus
.
pfizer
launched
a
clinical
trial
in
march
to
study
its
safety
in
people
,
and
expects
to
move
to
later-stage
testing
next
month.dr
.
kessler
acknowledged
that
there
will
be
challenges
in
using
such
pills
to
drive
down
hospitalizations
and
deaths
from
covid-19
.
people
will
need
to
gain
access
to
the
drugs
as
soon
as
they
test
positive
.
“
your
testing
programs
are
going
to
have
to
be
linked
to
your
treatment
,
”
he
said.and
if
the
history
of
antiviral
research
is
any
guide
,
the
first
drugs
for
covid-19
will
probably
only
offer
modest
benefit
against
the
disease
,
dr.
fauci
said
.
but
that
would
be
a
good
start.
“
with
all
of
these
drugs
that
we
’
ve
dealt
with
over
the
years
,
we
’
ve
never
hit
a
home
run
the
first
time
at
bat
,
”
dr.
fauci
said
.
“
a
line
drive
off
the
left-field
wall
to
start
would
be
really
good.
”
the
government
will
also
spend
up
to
$
1.2
billion
on
research
centers
where
scientists
will
carry
out
early-stage
studies
on
drugs
that
block
the
coronavirus
in
other
ways
.
some
drugs
may
interfere
with
other
essential
viral
proteins
,
while
others
may
make
it
impossible
to
copy
the
virus
’
s
genes.even
if
the
next
generation
of
pills
doesn
’
t
arrive
for
a
few
years
,
many
scientists
say
that
the
research
will
be
a
good
investment
.
“
it
could
help
with
this
pandemic
and
potentially
provide
a
first
line
of
defense
for
the
next
one
,
”
said
mark
namchuk
,
the
director
of
therapeutic
translation
at
harvard
medical
school.the
program
will
support
not
only
research
on
pills
that
work
against
coronaviruses
,
but
also
against
other
high-risk
pathogens
,
such
as
flaviviruses
,
which
cause
diseases
such
as
dengue
fever
and
west
nile
fever
,
and
togaviruses
,
which
cause
mosquito-borne
diseases
like
chikungunya
and
eastern
equine
encephalitis.
“
there
will
always
be
a
threat
,
”
dr.
fauci
said
.
“
i
think
there
’
s
going
to
be
a
long-range
need
for
drugs.
”
on
the
heels
of
president
biden
’
s
abrupt
order
to
u.s.
intelligence
agencies
to
investigate
the
origins
of
the
coronavirus
,
many
scientists
reacted
positively
,
reflecting
their
push
in
recent
weeks
for
more
information
about
the
work
of
a
virus
lab
in
wuhan
,
china
.
but
they
cautioned
against
expecting
an
answer
in
the
three-month
time
frame
of
the
president
’
s
request.after
long
steering
clear
of
the
debate
,
some
influential
scientists
have
lately
become
more
open
to
expressing
uncertainties
about
the
origins
of
the
virus
.
if
the
two
most
vocal
poles
of
the
argument
are
natural
spillover
vs.
laboratory
leak
,
these
new
voices
have
added
a
third
point
of
view
:
a
resounding
undecided.
“
in
the
beginning
,
there
was
a
lot
of
pressure
against
speaking
up
,
because
it
was
tied
to
conspiracies
and
trump
supporters
,
”
said
akiko
iwasaki
,
an
immunologist
at
yale
university
.
“
there
was
very
little
rational
discussion
going
on
in
the
beginning.
”
virologists
still
largely
lean
toward
the
theory
that
infected
animals
—
perhaps
a
bat
,
or
another
animal
raised
for
food
—
spread
the
virus
to
humans
outside
of
a
lab
.
there
is
no
direct
evidence
for
the
“
lab
leak
”
theory
that
chinese
researchers
isolated
the
virus
,
which
then
infected
a
lab
worker.but
china
’
s
integral
role
in
a
joint
inquiry
with
the
world
health
organization
made
its
dismissal
of
the
lab
leak
theory
difficult
to
accept
,
dr.
iwasaki
and
17
other
scientists
argued
in
the
journal
science
this
month.
“
i
typically
only
speak
about
a
topic
publicly
if
i
have
some
new
scientific
result
that
makes
me
confident
about
a
new
discovery
or
conclusion
,
”
said
one
of
the
organizers
of
that
letter
,
jesse
bloom
,
who
studies
the
evolution
of
viruses
at
the
fred
hutchinson
cancer
research
center
.
“
in
the
case
of
sars-cov-2
origins
,
i
still
am
not
confident
about
what
happened.
”
but
“
as
time
went
on
,
it
became
clear
that
not
saying
anything
about
the
origins
was
being
interpreted
as
agreeing
with
the
idea
that
the
virus
definitely
originated
from
a
zoonosis
,
”
he
said
,
referring
to
an
animal
spillover.on
wednesday
,
two
weeks
after
that
letter
was
published
,
president
biden
called
on
intelligence
agencies
to
“
redouble
their
efforts
”
and
deliver
a
report
to
him
within
90
days
.
on
thursday
mr.
biden
said
he
expected
to
release
the
report
to
the
public.while
researchers
generally
welcome
a
sustained
search
for
answers
,
some
warn
that
those
answers
may
not
arrive
any
time
soon
—
if
ever.
“
at
the
end
of
this
process
,
i
would
not
be
surprised
if
we
did
not
know
much
more
than
we
know
now
,
”
said
w.
ian
lipkin
,
a
virologist
at
the
mailman
school
of
public
health
at
columbia
university
who
was
one
of
the
first
u.s.
scientists
to
visit
china
in
early
2020
and
consult
with
public
health
authorities
there.china
’
s
lack
of
cooperation
with
the
w.h.o
.
has
long
fueled
suspicions
about
how
the
coronavirus
,
known
as
sars-cov-2
,
had
emerged
seemingly
from
nowhere
to
seize
the
world.in
february
2020
,
the
chinese
government
agreed
to
host
a
scientific
mission
,
but
it
came
under
fire
from
critics
because
it
was
constructed
as
a
cooperative
study
with
international
experts
and
chinese
scientists
,
and
the
chinese
controlled
access
to
data
.
in
addition
,
the
mission
had
no
mandate
to
investigate
laboratories
where
research
on
viruses
was
conducted.in
early
days
,
speculations
even
circulated
that
a
chinese
biological
warfare
program
had
produced
the
virus
.
in
march
2020
,
dr.
lipkin
and
colleagues
published
a
letter
in
which
they
dismissed
that
possibility.
“
there
was
no
evidence
to
suggest
this
had
been
weaponized
,
”
dr.
lipkin
said
.
“
i
haven
’
t
changed
my
view
on
that.
”
evolution
was
more
than
capable
of
brewing
a
new
pandemic
virus
,
he
and
other
experts
said
.
bats
and
many
other
animals
are
hosts
to
coronaviruses
.
when
an
animal
is
infected
by
two
strains
of
coronaviruses
,
they
can
swap
genetic
material
in
a
process
called
recombination.as
scientists
find
more
animal
coronaviruses
,
they
can
recognize
more
and
more
pieces
of
sars-cov-2
spread
out
among
them
.
researchers
have
also
been
able
to
reconstruct
some
of
the
evolutionary
steps
by
which
sars-cov-2
evolved
into
a
potential
human
pathogen
while
it
was
still
infecting
animals.this
pattern
is
probably
one
that
’
s
been
followed
by
many
viruses
that
are
now
major
burdens
on
human
health
.
h.i.v.
,
for
example
,
most
likely
had
its
origin
in
the
early
1900s
,
when
hunters
in
west
africa
got
infected
with
viruses
that
infected
chimpanzees
and
other
primates.but
some
scientists
thought
it
was
too
soon
to
conclude
something
similar
happened
in
the
case
of
sars-cov-2
.
after
all
,
the
coronavirus
first
came
to
light
in
the
city
of
wuhan
,
home
to
the
wuhan
institute
of
virology
,
where
researchers
study
dozens
of
strains
of
coronaviruses
collected
in
caves
in
southern
china.still
,
that
a
top
lab
studying
this
family
of
viruses
happens
to
be
located
in
the
same
city
where
the
epidemic
emerged
could
very
well
be
a
coincidence
.
wuhan
is
an
urban
center
larger
than
new
york
city
,
with
a
steady
flow
of
visitors
from
other
parts
of
china
.
it
also
has
many
large
markets
dealing
in
wildlife
brought
from
across
china
and
beyond
.
when
wild
animals
are
kept
in
close
quarters
,
viruses
have
an
opportunity
to
jump
from
species
to
species
,
sometimes
resulting
in
dangerous
recombinations
that
can
lead
to
new
diseases.that
lab
’
s
research
began
after
another
coronavirus
led
to
the
sars
epidemic
in
2002
.
researchers
soon
found
relatives
of
that
virus
,
called
sars-cov
,
in
bats
,
as
well
as
civet
cats
,
which
are
sold
in
chinese
markets
.
the
discovery
opened
the
eyes
of
scientists
to
all
the
animal
coronaviruses
with
the
potential
of
spilling
over
the
species
line
and
starting
a
new
pandemic.virologists
can
take
many
measures
to
reduce
the
risk
of
getting
infected
with
the
viruses
they
study
.
but
over
the
years
,
some
accidents
have
happened
.
researchers
have
gotten
sick
,
and
they
’
ve
infected
others
with
their
experimental
viruses.in
2004
,
for
example
,
a
researcher
at
the
national
institute
of
virology
in
beijing
got
infected
with
the
coronavirus
that
causes
sars
.
she
passed
it
on
to
others
,
including
her
mother
,
who
died
from
the
infection.in
2020
,
the
origins
of
the
covid-19
pandemic
became
a
new
front
in
a
long-running
debate
over
lab
security
,
one
that
turns
on
the
question
of
whether
the
risks
of
studying
and
sometimes
manipulating
animal
viruses
outweigh
the
potential
for
that
work
to
help
guard
against
future
outbreaks.
“
this
kind
of
research
has
been
controversial
,
”
said
filippa
lentzos
,
a
biosecurity
researcher
at
king
’
s
college
london.chinese
scientists
and
government
officials
have
denied
that
the
covid-19
pandemic
was
the
result
of
a
lab
leak
.
and
a
number
of
outside
scientists
also
dismissed
the
idea.robert
garry
,
a
virologist
at
tulane
medical
school
and
a
co-author
of
dr.
lipkin
’
s
letter
,
observed
that
chinese
scientists
would
have
to
have
collected
sars-cov-2
and
then
grown
it
in
a
colony
of
cells
,
but
somehow
never
publish
any
details
of
it
even
as
they
published
reports
on
other
coronaviruses
for
years.
“
it
makes
no
sense
to
me
.
why
did
they
hold
onto
the
virus
?
”
dr.
garry
said.other
scientists
felt
that
,
at
the
very
least
,
the
possibility
of
a
lab
leak
should
be
explored
.
but
when
trump
administration
officials
claimed
the
virus
might
be
a
bioweapon
,
some
researchers
said
,
it
cast
a
shadow
over
the
idea
of
a
lab
leak.those
researchers
pinned
their
hopes
on
a
joint
inquiry
by
the
w.h.o
.
and
china
,
even
as
the
chinese

bend
the

its
advantage.at
the

believers
in
the
possibility
of
a

leak
were
trying
to
prepare
the
ground
for
scientists
to
speak
more
openly
about
their
misgivings
.
in
a
series
of
open
letters
,
a
collection
of
researchers
that
became
known
as
the
paris
group
took
pains
to
express
concerns
about
the
joint
inquiry
and
uncertainty
over
the
virus
’
s
origins
without
overtly
selling
the
lab
leak
theory.
“

toned
down

of

nikolai

“
the
minute
we
went
too
far
down
the
path
that
we
think
it

a

it
was
just
going
to
be
crucified.
”
in
march
2021
,
the
w.h.o.-china
team
released
a
report
that
dedicated
only
four
out
of
313
pages
to
the
possibility
of
a
lab
leak
,
without
any
substantial
data
to
back
up
their
conclusion
that
it
was
highly
unlikely.dr
.
iwasaki
and
like-minded
scientists
decided
they
had
to
push
back
with
their
own
letter
.
“
we
feel
that
it

really

to
speak
up
about

get
more
science
behind

going
on

”
she
said.yet
dr.
iwasaki
stressed
that
she
did
not
see
a
clear
case
for
a

leak
.
“
i
’
m
completely
open-minded
about
the
possibilities

”
she
said
.
“
there
’
s
so
little

almost

dr.
lipkin
said
he
was
dismayed
to
learn
of
two
coronavirus
studies
from
the
wuhan
institute
of
virology
that
had
been
carried
out
with
only
a
modest
level
of
safety
measures
,
known
as
bsl-2.in
an
interview
with
the
times
,
dr.
lipkin
said
this
fact
wasn
’
t
proof
in
itself
that
sars-cov-2
spread
from
the
lab
.
“
but
it
certainly
does
raise
the
possibility
that
must
be
considered
,
”
he
said.a
bsl-2
level
of
research
would
also
add
to
the
difficulty
researchers
will
face
trying
to
pin
down
clear
evidence
that
a
coronavirus
infected
the
staff
.
at
higher
levels
of
security
,
staff
regularly
give
blood
samples
that
can
be
studied
later
for
genetic
material
from

and
antibodies
against
them
.
there
may
be
no
such
record
for
sars-cov-2.a
number
of
researchers
remain
unpersuaded
by
the
possibility
of
a
lab
leak
.
“
this
pathway
remains
the
least
likely
of
all
for
the
origin
of
covid-19
,
”
said
peter
daszak
,
a
virologist
at
ecohealth
alliance
who
has
worked
frequently
with
the
wuhan
virologists.
“
on
the
other
hand
,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
evidence
that
these
viruses
originate
in
wildlife
,
and
have
previously
and
repeatedly
infected
people
who
are
highly
exposed
to
these
animals
,
work
in
the
wildlife
trade

in
wildlife
farms

markets
,
”
dr.
daszak
said.earlier
this
month
,
dr.
garry
of
tulane
argued
that
the
genetic
variations
in
early
cases
of
covid-19
in
wuhan
could
be
explained
by
wild
animals
being
brought
to
animal
markets
in
the
city
.
“
if
you
suppose
that
the
viruses
came
in
through
the
wildlife
trade
,
then
it
’
s
pretty
simple
and
straightforward
,
”
he
said.even
if
sars-cov-2
jumped
from
bats
or
other
animals
to
humans
outside
of
a
lab
,
as
dr.
garry
suspects
,
it
will
be
hard
to
find
airtight
proof
for
that
pathway
.
when
animals
die
,
they
take
their
viruses
with
them.while
scientists
have
fairly
good
evidence
for
how
two
coronaviruses
—
the
cause
of
sars
and
mers
—
jumped
from
bats
to
humans
,
the
origins
of
the
other
four
coronaviruses
that
infect
humans
remain
a
mystery.
“
sometimes
you
get
lucky
,
sometimes

”
dr.
garry
said
.
“
it
can
take
decades.
”
when
the
coronavirus
vaccines
were
first
authorized
in
december
,
scientists
knew
little
about
how
well
they
might
work
in
pregnant

,
who
had
been
excluded
from
the
clinical

then
,
scientists
have
accumulated
a
small

of
evidence
that
the
vaccines
are
safe
and
effective
during

preliminary
results
from
two
continuing

provide
additional
encouraging
news.the
pfizer-biontech

are
likely
to
provide

some
protection
against

dangerous

,
according
to
a

also
pass

found
no

covid
presents
serious
risks
during

research
has
shown
,
for
instance
,
that
pregnant

with

symptoms
are
more
likely
to

admitted
to

of
these

,
the

immune

the

of
particular
note
,
experts
said
,
was
the
fact
that
the

produced
high
levels
of

which
can
prevent
the

“

eighty-four

that
’

fantastic.
”
the
findings
have
limitations
,
she
acknowledged
.
because
the

were
only
authorized
recently
,
most
of
the

in

on
dec.
29
,
a
national
guardsman
in
colorado
became
the
first
known
case
in
the
united
states
of
a
contagious
new
variant
of
the
coronavirus.the
news
was
unsettling
.
the
variant
,
called
b.1.1.7
,
had
roiled
britain
,
was
beginning
to
surge
in
europe
and
threatened
to
do
the
same
in
the
united
states
.
and
although
scientists
didn
’
t
know
it
yet
,
other
mutants
were
also
cropping
up
around
the
country
.
they
included
variants
that
had
devastated
south
africa
and
brazil
and
that
seemed
to
be
able
to
sidestep
the
immune
system
,
as
well
as
others
homegrown
in
california
,
oregon
and
new
york.this
mélange
of
variants
could
not
have
come
at
a
worse
time
.
the
nation
was
at
the
start
of
a
post-holiday
surge
of
cases
that
would
dwarf
all
previous
waves
.
and
the
distribution
of
powerful
vaccines
made
by
moderna
and
pfizer-biontech
was
botched
by
chaos
and
miscommunication
.
scientists
warned
that
the
variants
—
and
b.1.1.7
in
particular
—
might
lead
to
a
fourth
wave
,
and
that
the
already
strained
health
care
system
might
buckle.that
didn
’
t
happen
.
b.1.1.7
did
become
the
predominant
version
of
the
virus
in
the
united
states
,
now
accounting
for
nearly
three-quarters
of
all
cases
.
but
the
surge
experts
had
feared
ended
up
a
mere
blip
in
most
of
the
country
.
the
nationwide
total
of
daily
new
cases
began
falling
in
april
and
has
now
dropped
more
than
85
percent
from
the
horrific
highs
of
january.
“
it
’

pretty
humbling
,
”
said
kristian
andersen
,
a
virologist
at
scripps
research
in

jolla
,
calif.
“
we
could
actually
do
a
lot
better
than
i
had
expected.
”
dr
.
andersen
and
other
virus
watchers
still
see
variants
as
a
potential
source
of
trouble
in
the
months
to
come
—
particularly
one
that
has
battered
brazil
and
is
growing
rapidly
in
17
u.s.
states
.
but
they
are
also
taking
stock
of
the
past
few
months
to
better
understand
how
the
nation
dodged
the
variant
threat.experts
point
to
a
combination
of
factors
—
masks
,
social
distancing
and
other
restrictions
,
and
perhaps
a
seasonal
wane
of
infections
—
that
bought
crucial
time
for
tens
of
millions
of
americans
to
get
vaccinated
.
they
also
credit
a
good
dose
of
serendipity
,
as
b.1.1.7
,
unlike
some
of
its
competitors
,
is
powerless
against
the
vaccines.
“
i
think
we
got
lucky
,
to
be
honest

”
after
b.1.1.7
emerged
at
the
end
of
december
,
new
variants
with
combinations
of
troubling
mutations
came
to
light
.
scientists
fretted
about
how
the
competition
between
the
variants
might
play
out.in
january
,
researchers
in
california
discovered
a
variant
with
10
mutations
that
was
growing
more
common
there
and
had
drifted
into
other
states
.
laboratory
experiments
suggested
that
the
variant
could
dodge
an
antibody
treatment
that
had
worked
well
against
previous
forms
of
the
virus
,
and
that
it
was
perhaps
also
more
contagious.in
the
months
that
have
followed
,
the
united
states
has
drastically
improved
its
surveillance
of
how
the
variants
mutate
.
last
week
more
than
28,800
virus
genomes
,
almost
10
percent
of
all
positive
test
cases
,
were
uploaded
to
an
international
online
database
called
gisaid
.
that
clearer
picture
has
enabled
scientists
to
watch
how
the
mutants
compete.the
california
variant
turned
out
to
be
a
weak
competitor
,
and
its
numbers
dropped
sharply
in
february
and
march
.
it
is
still
prevalent
in
parts
of
northern
california
,
but
it
has
virtually
disappeared
from
southern
parts
of
the
state
and
never
found
a
foothold
elsewhere
in
the
country
.
by
april
24
,
it
accounted
for
just
3.2
percent
of
all
virus
samples
tested
in
the
country
,
as
b.1.1.7
soared
to
66
percent.
“
b.1.1.7
went
in
for
the
knockout
,
and
it
’
s
like
,
‘
bye
bye
,
california
variant
,
’
”
dr.
andersen
said.on
the
other
side
of
the
country
,
researchers
reported
in
february
that
a
variant
called
b.1.526
was
spreading
quickly
in
new
york
and
appeared
to
be
a
formidable
adversary
for

.
by
february
,
each
of
those
variants
had
grown
to
about
35
percent
of
the
samples
collected
by
dr.
grubaugh
’
s
lab
in
connecticut
.
but
b.1.1.7
came
out
on
top.in
fact
,
b.1.1.7
seems
to
have
the
edge
over
nearly
every
variant
identified
so
far
.
at
a
congressional
hearing
on
tuesday
,
dr.
rochelle
p.
walensky
,
the
director
of
the
centers
for
disease
control
and
prevention
,
said
b.1.1.7
made
up
72
percent
of
cases
in
the
country.
“
we
’
re
really
seeing
b.1.1.7
pushing
out
other
variants
decisively
,
”
said
emma
hodcroft
,
an
epidemiologist
at
the
university
of
bern.the
variants
identified
in
california
and
new
york
turned
out
to
be
only
moderately
more
contagious
than
older
versions
of
the
virus
,
and
much
of
their
initial
success
may
have
been
luck
.
the
overall
boom
in
cases
last
fall
amplified
what
might
otherwise
have
gone
undetected.it
’
s
unclear
what
gives
b.1.1.7
an
edge
over
the
others
.
“
is
it
the
greatest
of
all
the
variants
?
it
’
s
just
really
hard
to
say
right
now
,
”
said
angela
rasmussen
,
a
virologist
at
the
university
of
saskatchewan
’
s
vaccine
and
infectious
disease
organization
.
“
we
need
more
research
to
figure
out
more
about
what
all
of
these
combinations
of
mutations
are
doing.
”
some
answers
may
come
from
california
,
where
researchers
are
staging
a
head-to-head
competition
in
a
lab
,
injecting
mice
with
a
cocktail
of
b.1.1.7
and
six
other
variants.
“
the
idea
is
to
see
which
one
will
win
out
,
”
said
dr.
charles
chiu
,
a
virologist
at
the
university
of
california
,
san
francisco
,
who
was
the
first
scientist
to
discover
the
california
variant.in
michigan
,
one
of
the
few
states
that
saw
the
predicted
surge
in
cases
this
spring
,
b.1.1.7
found
a
hook
in
younger
people
who
were
returning
to
schools
and
playing
contact
sports.
“
because
it
’
s
more
transmissible
,
the
virus
finds
cracks
in
behavior
that
normally
wouldn
’
t
have
been
as
much
of
a
problem
,
”
said
emily
martin
,
an
epidemiologist
at
the
university
of
michigan.but
in
the
rest
of
the
country
,
people
naturally
became
more
cautious
when
confronted
with
the
horrifying
toll
of
the
virus
after
the
holidays
.
b.1.1.7
is
thought
to
be
about
60
percent
more
contagious
than
previous
forms
of
the
virus
,
but
its
mode
of
spread
is
no
different
.
most
states
had
at
least
partial
restrictions
on
indoor
dining
and
instituted
mask
mandates.
“
b.1.1.7
is
more
transmissible
,
but
it
can
’
t
jump
through
a
mask
,
”
dr.
hodcroft
said
.
“
so
we
can
still
stop
its
spread.
”
but
other
experts
are
still
discomfited
by
how
much
the
virus
seems
to
have
defied
predictions.
“
i
can
’
t
necessarily
ascribe
it
just
to
behavior
,

said
sarah
cobey
,
an
evolutionary
biologist
at
the
university

chicago
.
respiratory
viruses
sometimes
go
through
seasonal
cycles
,
but
it
’
s
not
clear
why
the
coronavirus
’
s
cycle
would
have
caused
it
to
decline
in
the
middle
of
winter
.
“
that
makes
me
feel
maybe
even
more
ignorant
,
”
she
said.also
puzzling
is
why
variants
that
pummeled
other
countries
have
not
yet
spread
widely
in
the
united
states
.
b.1.351
rapidly
dominated
south
africa
and
some
other
african
countries
late
last
year
.
it
was
first
reported
in
the
united
states
on
jan.
28
,
but
still
accounts
for
only
1
percent
of
cases
.
that
may
be
because
it
can
’
t
get
ahead
of
the
fast-spreading
b.1.1.7.
“
i
think
that
is
because
it
doesn
’
t
really
have
much
transmission
advantage
,
”
said
william
hanage
,
an
epidemiologist
at
the
harvard

chan
school
of
public
health.p.1
,
a
variant
that
is
ravaging
brazil
,
got
off
to
a
slow
start
in
the
united
states
but
is
now
estimated
to
make
up
more
than
10
percent
of
the
country
’
s
cases.
“
i
believe
it
is
a
matter
of
time
before
the
p.1
variant
becomes
one
of
the
most
prevalent
in
the
u.s.a.
,
”
warned
dr.

ricardo
ribas

in

,
nels
elde
,
an
evolutionary
biologist
at
the
university
of
utah
,
said
the
events
of
the
past
four
months
raised
questions
about
whether
it
was
worth
fretting
over
different
variants
,
rather
than
focusing
on
the
behaviors
that
can
rein
in
all
of
them.
“
we
’
re
splitting
hairs
between
a
handful
of
mutations
here
and
there
,
we
’
ve
lost
some
perspective
,
”
he
said
.
“
it
’
s
catnip
for
a
curious
mind.
”
the
united
states
also
has
an
ample
supply
of
powerful
vaccines
that
make
variants
more
an
academic
concern
than
a
cause
of
worry
for
the
average
person
.
the
vaccines
may
be
slightly
less
effective
against
the
variants
identified
in
south
africa
and
brazil
,
but
they
prevent
severe
disease
from
all
known
variants.it
’
s
not
impossible
the
situation
could
worsen
.
only
about
35
percent
of
people
in
the
united
states
have
been
fully
immunized
,
and
the
protection
from
the
vaccines
may
wane
by
the
winter
.
no
one
knows
how
variants
emerging
in
other
parts
of
the
world
,
like
one
that
has
come
to
prominence
in
india
and
is
circulating
at
low
levels
in
the
united
states
,
will
behave
here
.
and
yet
more
variants
will
inevitably
arise
in
places
where
the
virus
is
rampant
,
dr.
cobey
warned
:
“
there
’
s
a
lot
of
evolution
to
happen
yet.
”
in
january
,
a
man
in
his
60s
with
heart
disease
and
diabetes
went
to
a
south
dakota
hospital
with
a
cough
and
fever
,
worried
he
had
covid
.
a
nurse
swabbed
the
inside
of
his
nose
,
and
the
sample
went
into
a
small
device
resembling
an
inkjet-printer
cartridge
,
which
was
then
placed
into
a
machine
about
the
size
of
a
printer.this
so-called
quad
test
,
now
available
at
thousands
of
hospitals
and
clinics
around
the
country
,
could
detect
not
only
the
coronavirus
,
but
two
types
of
influenza
and
the
respiratory
syncytial
virus
,
or
r.s.v
.
a
little
more
than
a
half-hour
later
,
dr.
blake
gustafson
had
the
patient

result
:
he
had
the

he
relayed

happily
adding
that
there
was
a
treatment
he
could
offer
right
away

tamiflu

“
the
relief
in
their
eyes
above
their
masks
was
very
satisfying
,
”
dr.
gustafson
said.the
patient
’
s
situation
was
somewhat
unusual
this
past
winter
given
that
the
united
states
,
like
many
other
countries
,
witnessed
a
shocking
absence
of
a
flu
season
.
but
as
the
country
begins
to
reopen
,
doctors
say
that
flu
and
other
pathogens
might
make
a
comeback
this
autumn
.
what
’
s
more
,
even
as
a
growing
number
of
people
get
vaccinated
against
covid
,
there
are
still
some
40,000
new
infections
every
day
in
the
united
states
,
and
a
significant
number
of
people
who
may
be
resistant
to
taking
the
vaccines.the
sanford
health
system
,
which
includes
46
hospitals
and
1,400
physicians
in
south
dakota
,
carries
out
600
to
800
tests
for
the
coronavirus
a
day
in
its
clinics
using
antigen
tests
,
which
detect
proteins
made
by
the
virus
.
but
according
to
rochelle
odenbrett
,
the
senior
executive
director
of
laboratories
,
the
organization
is
now
in
the
process
of
replacing
all
of
those
tests
with
the
quad
tests
used
in
its
emergency
settings.unlike
the
antigen
tests
,
the
quad
test
looks
for
a
virus

s
genetic
material
using
a
polymerase
chain
reaction
,
or
p.c.r
.
for
short
.
the
p.c.r.-based
method
is
far
more
accurate
than
the
antigen
approach
,
ms.

says
.
she
notes

of
patient
samples
used
to
be
more
cumbersome
and
relied

multistep
procedures
across

rooms
.
“
it
’
s
just
amazing
how
the
technology
has
evolved
,
”
she
said.the
quad
test
used
by
the
sanford
system
is
made
by
the
california-based
company
cepheid
,
which
received
emergency
authorization
from
the
food
and
drug
administration
in
late
september.although
last
year
’
s
flu
season
was
nonexistent
,
dr.
geoffrey
baird
of
the
university
of
washington
in
seattle
said
that
a
confluence
of
factors
might
precipitate
its
return
in
the
fall
:
children
returning
to
school
buildings
,
declining
use
of
masks
and
perhaps
a
lack
of
recent
immune
system
exposure
to
the
flu
.
if
more
people
get
sick
in
the
fall
,
he
added
,
they
will
want
to
know
if
it
is
flu
or
the
coronavirus.
“
we
in
the
laboratory
are
preparing
for
another
big
boom
in
testing
,
”
said
dr.
baird
,
whose
team
has
run
more
than
two
million
coronavirus
tests
since
the
beginning
of
the
pandemic
.
“
even
if
people
are
vaccinated
,
they
’
re
going
to
wonder
,
‘
am
i
the
breakthrough
case
?
’
”
in
addition
to
cepheid
,
other
companies
have
developed
tests
that
look
for
influenza
and
the
coronavirus
at
the
same
time
,
including
roche
,
which
has
received
emergency
use
authorization
for
a
test
that
looks
for
the
coronavirus
,
influenza
a
and
influenza
b
at
once.in
recent
years
various
hospitals
have
developed
in-house
versions
of
these
combination
tests
as
well
,
some
of
which
look
for
more
than
a
dozen
different
respiratory
pathogens
simultaneously

p.c.r
.
technology
.
those
“
multiplex
”
tests
are
especially
helpful
in
diagnosing
illnesses
in
people
with
weak
immune
systems
because
they
allow
doctors
to
swiftly
discern
what
pathogen
is
making
a
person
sick
before
it
is
too
late
to
start
the
right
treatments.a

and
roche
recently
bought
a
company
that
sells
a
machine
that
can
screen
for
more
than
20
pathogens
in
one
go.testing
for

pathogens
does
not

lead

,
however
.
co-infections
,
in
which
a
person
is
infected
with
multiple
viruses
simultaneously
,
are
more
common
than
doctors
expected
,
and
sometimes
the
multiplex
tests
might
detect
a
viral
infection
but
miss
a
bacterial
one
,
said
dr.
daniel
griffin
,
chief
of
infectious
diseases
at
prohealth
new
york
.
a
patient
could
carry
the
influenza
virus
but
also
test
positive
for
a
bacterium
such
as
pneumococcus
,
for
example.
“
we
initially
thought
that
every
time
we
identified
a
virus
,
we
would
just
be
able
stop
all
antibiotics
and
just
treat
the
virus
if
effective
antiviral
therapy
was
available
,
”
dr.
griffin
said
.
“
we
now
know
that
we
often
need
to
continue
antibiotics
,
”
he
explained
,
because
sometimes
the
multiplex
tests
are
not
sensitive
enough
to
rule
out
a
bacterial
culprit.doctors
and
test
developers
are
still
grappling
with
how
many
pathogens
to
test
patients
for
in
different
settings
.
“
a
burning
question
at
every
company

what
panel
is

is
it

said

miller

relatively
young
and
healthy
adults
might
just
need
a
quad
test
to
know
if
they
should
start
on
tamiflu
for
influenza
,
for
example
,
but
patients
with
underlying
chronic
diseases
who
are
very
sick
might
benefit
from
receiving
the
test
for
22
different
pathogens
so
that
doctors
can
decide
whether
they
need
to
be
admitted
to
a
hospital.before
the
pandemic
,
people
were
not

,
who
led
the
second
major
review
,
in
which
scientists
scrutinized
how
those
regulations
functioned
in
the
pandemic.both
reports
supported
the
creation
of
an
international
pandemic
treaty
that
would
establish
consequences
if
countries
failed
to
live
up
to
their
commitments
.
those
might
include
quickly
sharing
samples
and
sequences
of
emerging
pathogens
,
providing
rapid
access
to
teams
deployed
by
the

for
early
investigation
and
response
,
and
ensuring
equitable
distribution
of
vaccines
,
medicine
and
tests
around
the
world.both
reviews
also
noted
that
early
in
the
coronavirus
pandemic
,
many
countries
all
but
ignored
the
formal
warning
issued
by
the
w.h.o.
,
known
as
a
public
health
emergency
of
international
concern
.
its
unfortunate
acronym
,
pheic
,
is
often
pronounced
“
fake
,
”
one
of
the
reports
noted
.
(
whether
the
proposal
to
change
this
to
“
phemic
”
will
prove
more
stirring
remains
to
be
seen
.
)
the
independent
panel
also
concluded
that
the
warning
could
have
been
declared
at
least
a
week
earlier
than
it
was
—
on
jan.
22
,
2020
,
instead
of
jan.
30.even
then
,
“
so
many
countries
chose
to
wait
and
see
,
”
only
taking
concerted
action
once
intensive
care
beds
were
filled
,
ms.
clark
said.her
group
contends
that
if
its
recommendations
on
political
leadership
,
financing
and
surveillance
systems
had
been
in
place
,
the
coronavirus
outbreak
would
not
have
become
a
pandemic
.
it
also
said
that
digital
tools
,
such
as
those
that
scrape
social
media
for
rumors
of
new
outbreaks
,
should
be
better
incorporated
into
official
responses.notably
,
the
panel
did
not
delve
into
individual
countries
’
failures
in
its
report
,
determining
that
blame
would
not
be
“
a
very
useful
approach
,
”
said
dr.
anders
nordström
,
who
helped
lead
the
effort.but
the
group
did
commission
a
study
of
28
countries
with
high
,
medium
and
low
covid
death
rates
.
some
of
the
countries
with
the
lowest
tolls
had
previously
invested
in
outbreak
control
systems
after
experiencing
sars
,
mers
and
ebola
,
the
report
said
.
successful
countries
acted
quickly
,
coordinated
across
multiple
government
agencies
,
meticulously
isolated
people
with
the
virus
and
quarantined
those
exposed
to
it.the
worst
performing
countries
had
underfunded
,
fragmented
health
systems
and
“
uncoordinated
approaches
that
devalued

”
those
with
the
highest
death
tolls
,
including
brazil
and
the
united
states
,
denied
the
seriousness
of
the
pandemic
and
discouraged
action
,
the
panel
members
said
in
interviews.on
some
key
points
,
the
reports
came
to
different
conclusions
.
the
independent
panel
for
pandemic
preparedness
and
response
argued
that
the
international
health
regulations
governing
how
countries
are
supposed
to
prepare
for
and
report
emerging
outbreaks
“
serve
to
constrain
rather
than
to
facilitate
rapid
action.
”
it
noted
that
some
countries
assessed
as
highly
prepared
under
the
framework
also
had
high
death
rates
early
in
the
pandemic.but
the
other
group
,
which
spent
months
reviewing
those
regulations
,
found
that
many
could
have
helped
but
were
“
simply
not
implemented
by
various
countries
,
”
dr.
wieler
said.some
countries
were
not
even
aware
that
the
regulations
existed
,
his
group
reported
.
others
lacked
laws
vital
to
responding
to
outbreaks
,
such
as
those
authorizing
quarantines.changing
those
regulations
would
require
“
negotiations
for
years
,
”
dr.
wieler
said
,
noting
that
the
latest
set
took
a
decade
to
finalize
.
instead
,
one
of
his
committee
’
s
major
recommendations
was
to
increase
countries
’
accountability
for
their
obligations
,
including
though
a
pandemic
treaty
and
a
periodic
review
of
their
preparedness
that
would
involve
other
countries.the
independent
panel
also
proposed
creating
an
international
council
led
by
heads
of
state
to
keep
attention
on
health
threats
and
to
oversee
a
multibillion-dollar
financing
program
that
governments
would
contribute
to
based
on
their
ability
.
it
would
promise
quick
payouts
to
countries
contending
with
a
new
outbreak
,
giving
them
an
incentive
to
report.
“
there
’
s
only
going
to
be
the
political
will
to
create
those
things
when
something
catastrophic
happens
,
”
said
dr.
mark
dybul
,
one
of
the
panel
members
.
these
recommendations
stemmed
in
part
from
his
experience
leading
the
president
’
s
emergency
program
for
aids
relief
,
known
as
pepfar
,
and
the
global
fund
to
fight
aids
,
tuberculosis
and
malaria
,
he
said.but
dr.
wieler
,
who
led
the
other
international
review
,
said
that
in
general
,
creating
new
institutions
rather
than
focusing
on
improving
existing
ones
could
increase
costs
,
complicate
coordination
and
damage
the
w.h.o.the
recommendations
of
panels
after
global
emergencies
have
sometimes
been
embraced
.
the
ebola
outbreak
of
2014
and
2015
led
to
the
creation
of
the
w.h.o.
’
s
health
emergencies
program
,
aimed
at
boosting
the
agency
’
s
role
in
managing
health
crises
as
well
as
providing
technical
guidance
.
a
report
released
this
month
noted
that
the
new
program
had
received
“
increasingly
positive
feedback
”
from
countries
,
donors
and
partner
agencies
as
it
managed
dozens
of
health
and
humanitarian
emergencies.the
w.h.o
.
before
the
ebola
outbreak
and
after
it
are
“
two
different
agencies

”
said
dr.
joanne
liu
,
a
former
international
president
of
doctors
without
borders
and
a
member
of
the
independent
panel
.
dr.
liu
was
one
of
the
w.h.o.
’
s
most
trenchant
critics
during
the
ebola
response
,
and
she
noted
a
“
marked
improvement
”
in
how
quickly
the
agency
had
declared
an
international
emergency
this
time.dr
.
liu
said
her
biggest
fear
was
that
as
wealthier
countries
gained
an
upper
hand
on
the
virus
because
of
vaccines
,
they
would
leave
low-
and
middle-income
countries
behind
,
with
covid-19
becoming
“
a
neglected
pandemic
because
they
are
going
to
be
the
only
ones
fighting
it
—
a
bit
like
h.i.v
.
and
t.b.
”
to
avert
that
,
the
panel
released
a
slew
of
urgent
recommendations
and
called
for
the
world
’
s
entire
population
to
be
immunized
within
a
year.wealthy
countries
with
a
good
vaccine
pipeline
should
commit
to

dr.

the

with
:
“

just

”
according
to
recently
released
polls
,
parents
across
the
country
share
those
concerns
,
with
only
about
30
percent
saying
they
would
get
their

vaccinated
right
away
.
parents
of
infants

expressed
more
anxiety
about
the
vaccine
than

did.in

there
have
been
no
serious

for

far
,
and
dr.

heralded
the

12

as
“
a
critically
important
step
in

life-saving
vaccines
to

”
despite
evidence
of
the
vaccine

safety
,
several
parents

spoke
to
over
the
past
week
were
similarly
hesitant
about
getting
their

they
were
not
skeptical
about
all
vaccines
;
their
children
tended
to
be
up-to-date
with
recommended
well-child
vaccines

their
overall
fear
was
related
to
the
newness
of
the
vaccine

the
doctors

hopeful

as
the

becomes
a
reality
for

they
urged

worrisome
to
many
,
especially
as
vaccination
rates
have
dipped
a
bit
recently.the
reasons
for
the
u.s.
gender
gap
are
many
,
reflecting
the
role
of
women
in
specific
occupations
that
received
early
vaccine
priority
,
political
and
cultural
differences
and
long
standing
patterns
of
women
embracing
preventive
care
more
often
generally
than
men.the
gap
exists
even
as
covid-19
deaths
worldwide
have
been
about
2.4
times
higher
for
men
than
among
women
.
and
the
division
elucidates
the
reality
of
women
’
s
disproportionate
role
in
caring
for
others
in
american
society.
“
it
could
matter
to
localized
herd
immunity
,
”
said
alison
buttenheim
,
an
associate
professor
of
nursing
at
the
university
of
pennsylvania
and
expert
on
vaccine
hesitancy
.
“
while
most
experts
are
fretting
about
larger
gaps
by
race
,
political
party
,
religion
and
occupational
group
,
”
she
said
,
many
of
which
overlap
with
the
gender
disparities
,
“
i
haven
’
t
heard
of
any
specific
initiatives
to
target
men.
”
in
los
angeles
county
,
where
44
percent
of
women
over
16
have
gotten
their
first
shot
—
compared
with
30
percent
of
men
—
officials
are
scrambling
to
figure
out
how
to
do
just
that.
“
we
are
very
concerned
about
it
and
are
planning
to
embark
on
some
targeted
outreach
among
men
,
”
said
dr.
paul
simon
,
the
chief
science
officer
at
the
los
angeles
county
department
of
public
health
,
who
said
that
the
disparities
are
of
particular
concern
for
black
and
latino
men
.
only
19
percent
of
black
males
in
los
angeles
county
and
17
percent
of
latino
males
have
received
at
least
one
dose
of
the
vaccine
,
compared
with
35
percent
of
asian
men
and
32
percent
of
white
men
,
according
to
the
most
recent
data
available
from
early
this
month.
“
we
don
’
t
fully
understand
it
,
”
dr.
simon
said
.
“
one
of
our
messaging
strategies
will
be
that
the
vaccine
is
not
only
important
for
you
but
,
in
addition
,
is
a
means
of
protecting
others
in
your
family.
”
the
early
divisions
in
vaccine
rates
by
gender
could
largely
be
explained
by
demographics
.
americans
over
70
got
the
first
sets
of
doses
,
and
women
make
up
a
larger
proportion
of
that
age
group
.
in
many
states
,
health
care
workers
and
schoolteachers
were
also
given
vaccine
priority
:
women
account
for
three-quarters
of
full-time
health
care
workers
and
over
75
percent
of
public
schoolteachers
in
the
united
states
are
female.the
disparities
show
both
where
women
do
the
paid
and
unpaid
labor
of
life
.
for
instance
,
women
lost
the
majority
of
the
earliest
jobs
in
food
services
,
retail
businesses
,
health
care
and
government
jobs
.
the
mothers
among
them
have
done
most
of
the
work
in
the
shift
to
remote
schooling
and
caring
for
parents
and
sick
relatives.the
combination
may
have
increased
their
vaccine
motivation
in
two
ways
:
they
are
seeking
to
protect
the
rest
of
their
family
and
they
are
desperate
to
get
back
in
the
work
force
.
indeed
,
just
as
women
drove
the
job
losses
last
year
,
they
are
leading
the
economic
recovery
now
;
roughly
half
a
million
women
joined
the
labor
force
in
march
,
in
part
because
in-person
schooling
has
resumed
across
much
of
the
country.
“
in
addition
to
women
being
disproportionately
represented
in
several
essential
jobs
,
”
said
pilar
gonalons-pons
,
an
assistant
professor
of
sociology
at
the
university
of
pennsylvania
who
specializes
in
gender
issues
,
“
they
are
also
disproportionately
represented
as
unpaid
caregivers
for
older
adults
in
their
families
and
communities
,
and
this
can
also
be
an
additional
motivation
for
getting
the
vaccine.
”
in
many
ways
,
the
pattern
with
vaccines
reflects
longstanding
gender
differences
when
it
comes
to
preventive
health
care
.
women
are
on
average
more
likely
to
get
annual
physicals
than
men
,
even
when
adjusted
for
pre-existing
health
conditions
and
other
factors
,
and
are
more
likely
than
men
to
get
preventive
care.men
are
more
likely
than
women
to
engage
in
behaviors
that
hurt
their
health
—
like
heavy
drinking
,
smoking
and
illicit
drug
use
—
and
are
more
overweight
compared
to
women
.
men
are
less
likely
to
visit
doctors
regularly
and
go
to
the
emergency
room
in
a
crisis
and
to
get
basic
dental
care
,
according
to
federal
data
.
vaccines
are
no
exception
:
historically
,
influenza
vaccination
is
much
higher
among
females
—
about
63
percent
compared
to
53
percent
—
though
the
gap
narrows
in
americans
over
75
years
old.the
coronavirus
vaccine
“
is
the
latest
expression
of
the
tried-and-true
gender
gap
we
’
ve
long
witnessed
in
preventive
health
care
seeking
patterns
,
”
said
lindsey
leininger
,
a
health
policy
researcher
and
clinical
professor
at
tuck
school
of
business
at
dartmouth
college.but
experts
say
that
even
in
the
context
of
general
male
health
care
recalcitrance
,
there
may
be
some
factors
that
are
specific
to
this
vaccine
that
are
preventing
more
male
shots
in
arms
.
because
the
sign
up
has
been
cumbersome
and
confusing
,
men
may
have
had
less
patience
in
navigating
the
system
,
which
has
largely
taken
place
online
,
a
process
that
women
might
find
easier
since
they
tend
to
get
more
of
their
health
care
information
online.
“
we
have
to
figure
out
if
disparities
are
about
access
,
if
men
are
having
more
difficulty
navigating
the
appointment
systems
,
”
mr.
simon
of
los
angeles
said.further
,
when
it
comes
to
the
coronavirus
—
which
has
been
the
subject
of
rampant
misinformation
,
evolving
medical
advice
and
politicization
—
other
dynamics
may
be
at
work.
“
some
men
have
a
sense
that
they
are
not
necessarily
susceptible
,
”
mr.
simon
said
health
care
workers
have
told
officials
.
“
they
have
weathered
this
for
more
than
a
year
and
have
a
sense
of
omnipotence.
”
public
health
and
academic
experts
have
been
long
concerned
with
the
“
macho
”
effect
that
prevents
men
from
getting
all
sorts
of
health
care
,
and
fear
that
it
might
be
exacerbated
with
this
vaccine
.
(
notably
,
in
the
most
male
service
branch
of
the
military
,
the
marines
,
about
40
percent
of
those
who
were
offered
the
vaccine
by
the
defense
department
have
turned
it
down
.
)
“
this
avoidance
has
been
linked
to
masculinity
ideals
of
men
being
strong
,
invincible
and
not
asking
for
help
,
”
said
kristen
w.
springer
,
an
associate
professor
in
the
department
of
sociology
at
rutgers
university
in
new
jersey
who
has
done
research
on
this
trait.
“
in
other
words
,
these
cultural
ideals
lead
men
to
avoid
important
health
care
in
order
to
act
masculine
,
”
she
said
.
“
now
that
the
vaccine
is
available
to
everyone
,
it
will
be
interesting
to
watch
male-female
differences
in
vaccine
uptake
,
because
these
will
more
likely
reflect
social
and
cultural
ideas
about
gender
and
health
,
such
as
the
cultural
idea
that
‘
real
men
’
don
’
t
need
preventive
health
care.
”
at
this
stage
,
u.s.
health
authorities
have
not
released
data
on
nonbinary
adults
and
vaccination.there
may
also
be
political
connections
.
women
are
far
more
likely
than
men
to
register
as
democrats
,
and
polls
demonstrate
that
republicans
across
the
country
have
been
far
less
likely
than
democrats
to
embrace
the
vaccine.so
who
will
men
listen
to
?
not
their
wives
and
female
friends
or
doctors
,
it
seems
.
for
their
recent
preprint
study
,
leah
witus
and
erik
larson
,
professors
at
macalester
college
in
saint
paul
,
minn.
,
watched
videos
with
men
and
women
that
featured
identical
information
about
the
vaccine
.
among
the
1,184
americans
who
watched
them
,
most
were
positively
influenced
by
the
male
narrator
while
the
female
narrator
got
a
far
more
mixed
response.
“
the
male-narrated
version
of
the
video
increased
vaccination
intention
in
viewers
,
”
said
ms.
witus
,
“
but
the
female-narrated
had
mixed
associations
with
vaccine
propensity
,
and
in
some
viewers
,
those
that
identified
as
conservative
,
actually
decreased
vaccination
intention.
”
this
may
spell
victory
for
mr.
schillaci
as
he
and
his

subtly
joust
for
influence
over
their
20-year-old

scott
cohen
was
on
a
ventilator
struggling
for
his
life
with
covid-19
last
april
when
his
brothers
pleaded
with
plainview
hospital
on
long
island
to
infuse
him
with
the
blood
plasma
of
a
recovered
patient.the
experimental
treatment
was
hard
to
get

was
gaining
attention
at
a
time
when
doctors
had
little
else
.
after
an
online
petition
drew
18,000
signatures
,
the
hospital
gave
mr.

,
a
retired
nassau
county
medic
,
an
infusion
of
the
pale
yellow
stuff
that
some
called
“
liquid
gold.
”
in
those
terrifying
early
months
of
the
pandemic
,
the
idea
that
antibody-rich
plasma
could
save
lives
took
on
a
life
of
its
own
before
there
was
evidence
that
it
worked
.
the
trump
administration
,
buoyed
by
proponents
at
elite
medical
institutions
,
seized
on
plasma
as
a
good-news
story
at
a
time
when

times.but
by
the
end

the
year
,
good
evidence
for

not

many
prestigious
medical
centers
to
quietly
abandon
it

by

it
didn

t
need
any
more
plasma.a
year
ago
,
when
americans
were
dying
of
covid
at
an
alarming
rate
,
the
federal
government
made
a
big
bet
on
plasma
.
no
one
knew
if
the
treatment
would
work
,
but
it
seemed
biologically
plausible
and
safe
,
and
there
wasn
’
t
much
else
to
try
.
all
told
,
more
than
722,000
units
of
plasma
were
distributed
to
hospitals
thanks
to
the
federal
program
,
which
ends
this
month.the
government
’
s
bet
did
not
result
in
a
blockbuster
treatment
for
covid-19
,
or
even
a
decent
one
.
but
it
did
give
the
country
a
real-time
education
in
the
pitfalls
of
testing
a
medical
treatment
in
the
middle
of
an
emergency
.
medical
science
is
messy
and
slow
.
and
when
a
treatment
fails
,
which
is
often
,
it
can
be
difficult
for
its
strongest
proponents
to
let
it
go.because
the
government
gave
plasma
to
so
many
patients
outside
of
a
controlled
clinical
trial
,
it
took
a
long
time
to
measure
its
effectiveness
.
eventually
,
studies
did
emerge
to
suggest
that
under
the
right
conditions
,
plasma
might
help
.
but
enough
evidence
has
now
accumulated
to
show
that
the
country
’
s
broad
,
costly
plasma
campaign
had
little
effect
,

in
people
whose
disease
was
advanced

trial

when

around

as

she
became
fixated
on
how
she
could
help.she
formed
a
facebook
group
of
covid-19
survivors
that
grew
to
more
than
160,000
members

eventually
became

she
livestreamed
her

prompted
more

why
this

of

we
continue

”
the
company
also
said
,
in
a
letter
published
on
friday
in
the
new
england
journal
of
medicine
,
that
no
causal
link
had
been
established
between
its
vaccine
and
the
clotting
disorder.to
some
critics
,
it
makes
no
sense
to
hobble
a
global
vaccination
campaign
during
a
pandemic
just
because
of
a
few
cases
of
a
rare
disorder.but
while
rare
side
effects
may
be
tolerated
as
the
price
we
must
pay
for
some
drugs
or
vaccines
,
even
the
rarest
ones
are
difficult
to
accept
if
they
are
severe
and
unpredictable
—
like
blood
clots
in
the
brain
,
especially
in
young
,
healthy
people.
“
this
is
a
devastating
complication
,
”
dr.
anthony
fauci
,
the
chief
medical
adviser
for
the
pandemic
in
the
biden
administration
,
said
in
an
interview.he
added
:
“
one
woman
died
,
three
are
in
the
hospital
,
one
in
intensive
care
.
even
though
the
numbers
are
small
,
it
is
a
devastating
complication
,
so
i
believe
—
i
didn
’
t
make
the
decision
—
i
believe
their
rationale
,
at
least
from
what
they
communicated
to
me
,
is
that
they
wanted
to
call
a
quick
pause
to
see
,
to
alert
people
.
sometimes
this
starts
with
minor
symptoms
,
like
a
little
abdominal
discomfort
,
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
they
wind
up
having
a
stroke.
”
he
also
said
,
“
maybe
there
are
a
lot
more
people
out
there
we
’
re
not
noticing
,
because
of
the
spectrum
of
the
disease.
”
informing
doctors
and
the
public
of
the
symptoms
—
severe
headaches
,
shortness
of
breath
,
leg
or
abdominal
pain
—
could
help
identify
more
cases.another
reason
for
the
pause
,
dr.
fauci
said
,
is
to
let
doctors
know
that
the
drug
heparin
,
a
standard
treatment
for
blood
clots
,
should
not
be
given
to
these
patients
,
“
because
heparin
in
this
circumstance
can
make
things
worse.
”
it
is
not
known
whether
the
heparin
initially
given
to
some
of
the
patients
exacerbated
their
condition.experts
are
recommending
the
use
of
other
blood
thinners
,
which
patients
urgently
need
,
because
their
blood
clots
keep
growing
,
and
new
ones
keep
forming
.
doctors
in
europe
who
treated
recipients
of
the
astrazeneca
vaccine
who
had
a
similar
condition
said
it
could
worsen
rapidly.
“
the
real
issue
is
how
long
they
take
to
make
up
their
mind
about
what
they
’
re
going
to
do
,
”
dr.
fauci
said
of
the
c.d.c.
’
s
advisory
panel
.
“
the
rest
of
the
world
is
watching
this
,
and
j.
&
j
.
is
hopefully
going
to
be
an
important
part
of
the
worldwide
response
,
as
is
astrazeneca.
”
he
added
,
“
you
don
’
t
want
to
rush
them
,
but
i
hope
they
make
up
their
minds
in
a
reasonable
amount
of
time.
”
another
of
the
first
six
patients
with
the
clotting
condition
was
a
healthy
48-year-old
woman
who
went
to
an
emergency
room
in
nebraska
because
she
had
felt
ill
with
abdominal
pain
for
three
days
.
her
case
was
described
in
a
letter
to
the
editor
of
the
new
england
journal
of

published
on
wednesday
.
her
platelet
count
was
low
,
and
other
blood
tests
were
also
abnormal
.
a
c.t

scan
found
extensive
blood
clots
in
veins
in
her
abdomen
.
she
began
having
headaches
,
and
another
scan
found
clots
in
her
brain.she
was
given
heparin
.
more
clots
developed
,
and
she
had
a
hemorrhagic
stroke.doctors
then
learned
that
she
had
received
the
johnson

johnson
vaccine
two
weeks
before
.
they
stopped
the
heparin
and
gave
her
a
different
blood
thinner
,
along
with
intravenous
immune
globulin
,
a
treatment
also
recommended
for
the
clotting
disorder
.
her
platelet
count
increased
,
but
,
the
doctors
wrote
,
“
the

remained
critically
ill

”
the
young
woman
in
nevada
was
fighting
for
her
life
and
had
to
be
placed
on
a
ventilator
,
according
to
dr.

.
he
said
he
was
speaking
independently

not
as

lipman
said
that
as
the
team
had
studied
her
blood
samples
,
the
pieces
began
to
fall
into
place
,
and
they
realized
that
she
appeared
to
have
the
same
problem
that
they
knew
had
been
occurring
in
britain
and
europe
after
patients
received
the
astrazeneca
vaccine
,
mostly
in
young
women
.
they
switched
from
heparin
to
another
blood-thinner
and
began
following
guidance
provided
by
doctors
in
britain
who
had
treated
astrazeneca
recipients
with
a
similar
disorder.hoping
for
more
information
about
the
condition
and
any
possible
connection
to
the
johnson

,
dr.
lipman
called
an
emergency
number
at
the
food

administration
.
it
was
a
weekend
,
and
he
said
the

told
him
that
no

dr

after
the

nevada
officials
issued
a
statement
saying
the
meeting
was
the
first
time
they
had
learned
of
a

in
their

—
they
had
previously
told
the

no

—
and
they
were
asking
“
federal
partners
”
why
the
state
had
not
been
informed.at
the
nevada
hospital
,
an
interventional
radiologist
passed
a
tube
through
blood
vessels
and
on
into
the
young
woman
’
s
brain
and
used
a
device
to
suction
out
the
blood
clots
.
more
clots
formed
later
,
and
he
performed
the
procedure
again.but
the
condition
causes
more
than
clots
:
the
patient
,
like
others
,
also
had
a
brain
hemorrhage.she
was
transferred
to
a
larger
hospital
,
where
she
is
still
on
a
ventilator
,
dr.
lipman
said
.
her
prognosis
is
uncertain
,
he
said
,
adding
,
“
her

not

”
as
the
pandemic
winds
down
in
the
u.s.
,
companies
are
preparing
to
bring
millions
of
employees
back
into
the
office.the
argument
many
employers
are
making
is
that
being
in
the
office
is
essential
for
collaboration
and
innovation
.
they
say
that
fresh
insights
and
keen
decision
making
are
born
out
of
chance
encounters
and
spontaneous
meetings.but
is
that
true
?
my
colleague
claire
cain
miller
,
who
writes
about
gender
and
the
future
of
work
,
dug
into
this
question
and
found
that
not
only
is
there
no
evidence
to
back
up
that
argument
,
but
that
in
some
cases
,
the
opposite
may
be
true
.
the
office
stifles
creativity
because
it
can
create
an
inhospitable
environment
for
many
people.
“
long
hours
of
face-time
requirements
in
the
office
are
often
worse
for
many
women
,
many
people
of
color
,
people
who
have
caregiving
responsibilities
,
people
with
disabilities
,
people
who
are
shy

claire

“
and
when
you
lose
those
people
you
’

losing

”
remote
work
,
however
,
can
enable

to
bubble
up
from
people
with
varied
backgrounds

people
who
are
not
comfortable
speaking
up
in
an
in-person
meeting
may
feel
more
able
to
participate
in
a
virtual
setting

brainstorming
sessions
using
apps

slack
can
uncover
many
more
perspectives
by
including
people
who
wouldn

t
have
otherwise
been
invited
to
a
meeting
,
like
interns
or
employees
from
other
departments.companies
insisting
on
in-person
work
may
also
be
overlooking
one
of
the
big
takeaways
from
the
country
’
s
mass
experiment
in
working
from
home
.
even
as
the
virus
terrified
workers
,
sickened
millions
and
devastated
entire
industries
,
a
funny
thing
happened
:
“
it
worked
out
really
well
for
many
white-collar
workers

”
claire
said.sure
,
many
parents
had
their
kids
home
from
school
and
workers
were
constantly
worried
about
getting
sick
,
but
for
many
“
it
was
good
for
productivity
,
and
work-life
balance
,
”
claire
said
.
but
corporate
culture
is
hard
to
change
because
companies
tend
to
stick
with
what
they
know
,
claire
said
.
employers
may
be
wary
of
allowing
people
to
work
from
home
indefinitely
;
it
requires
a
lot
of
trust
in
employees.
“
people
who
are
making
these
decisions
are
usually
managers
,
and
they
are
the
people
that

to
have
visibility
into
what
their
employees
are
doing
,
”
claire
said
.
“
the
people
who
are
making
these

also
the

in

epidemic
swept
east

some
20,000
years
ago

the
finding
could
be
useful
in

development.
“

,
from
our
very
,
very
ancient
forebears
,
”
carl
zimmer
,
our
colleague
from
the

desk
,
told
us
.
“
this
was
a
pandemic
that
was
so
big
in
east

that
it
left
a
mark
on

it

a
finding
that
could
prophesy
our
fate
if
we
do
not
get
this

under

and
disturbingly
,
the

appears
to
have
circulated
at
a
time
when
people
were
still
living
in
small
hunter-gatherer
bands

pointing
to
the
potency

the
researchers
looked
at

in
the
parts
of
the
human
genome
known
to
be
crucial
in
fighting
coronaviruses
.
in
those
genes
,
the
scientists
looked
for
evidence

(
people
with
a
specific
mutation
would
have
been
more
likely
to
survive
a
coronavirus
infection
while
those
without
it
would
probably
have
died
.
)
in
east
asian
populations
,
but
not
others
,
enard
found
that
42
of
the
coronavirus-specific
genes
had
dominant
versions
that
evolved
at
the
same
time.
“
those
42
genes
went
through
an
evolutionary
change
all
at
the
same
time
,
”
carl
said
.
“
that
is
a
sign
of
the
kind
of
evolution
you

d
expect
if
humans
were
being
hit
all
at
once
with
a
massive
pandemic
,
so
that
all
of
these
genes
were
being
selected
at
the

time
for
survival.

this
finding
could
have
big
implications
for
the
scientists
trying
to
design
drugs

help
us
fight
our
way
out
of

current
pandemic.
“

know
for
certain
:
how
did
the
covid-19
pandemic
begin
?
from
the
outbreak
’
s
early
days
,
most
scientists
assumed
that
the
virus
,
sars-cov-2
,
had
jumped
from
an
animal
to
a
person
in
late
2019
,
possibly
at
a
meat
market
in
wuhan
,
china
,
the
city
of
11
million
where
the
first
known
covid
cases
were
identified
.
but
in
may
,
the
times
reported
that
u.s.
intelligence
agencies
were
investigating
another
explanation
that
had
been
debated
for
months
:
that
the
virus
had
accidentally
escaped
from
a
lab.how
did
this
idea
,
once
dismissed
as
a
conspiracy
theory
,
become
a
plausible
hypothesis
for
the
virus
’
s
origins
?
and
why
now
?
here
’
s
what
people
are
saying.in
late
january
of
2020
,
after
wuhan
was
placed
under
lockdown
,
the
lancet
published
a
paper
by
chinese
scientists
positing
that
the
virus
had
come
from
bats
,
perhaps
by
way
of
another
animal
at
the
wuhan
meat
market
.
it
remains
a
reasonable
assumption
to
have
made
:
this
kind
of
animal-to-human
transmission
,
known
as
zoonotic
spillover
,
is
believed
to
be
responsible
for
two-thirds
of
human
infectious
diseases
,
including
ebola
,
sars
and
many
types
of
the
flu.but
in
february
2020
,
two
chinese
researchers
suggested
in
a
since-withdrawn
paper
that
sars-cov-2
had
“
probably
originated
”
in
one
of
two
laboratories
—
the
wuhan
institute
of
virology
or
the
wuhan
center
for
disease
control
.
both
conduct
some
of
the
world
’
s
most
extensive
research
on
bat
coronaviruses
through
the
collection
of
cave
samples
,
often
yielding
important
findings
:
in
2017
,
an
esteemed
virologist
at
the
wuhan
institute
,
shi
zhengli
,
was
able
to
trace
sars
,
which
broke
out
in
2002
,
back
to
a
colony
of
horseshoe
bats
.
shi
went
on
to
publish
some
of
the
most
important
early
research
on
sars-cov-2.there
have
long
been
concerns
,
though
,
that
such
intimate
study
of
bat-borne
viruses
could
itself
cause
a
spillover
event.some
believe
that
shi
’
s
team
was
responsible
not
just
for
accidentally
leaking
sars-cov-2
,
but
also
for
creating
it
.
in
a
controversial
study
in
2015
,
a
university
of
north
carolina
lab
used
data
from
shi
—
and
funding
from
the
national
institutes
of
health
—
to
engineer
a
coronavirus
capable
of
infecting
human
airway
cells
.
some
scientists
argue
that
this
type
of

,
known
as
gain-of-function
,
is
useful
for
anticipating
potential
pandemics
.
but
others
have
criticized
it
as
too
risky
,
stirring
speculation
about
whether
sars-cov-2
might
have
been
engineered
in
dr.
shi
’
s
lab
before
escaping.shi
,
for
her
part
,
has
vehemently
denied
both
forms
of
the
lab-leak
theory
:
she
told
the
times
last
week
that
her
lab
has
never
conducted
gain-of-function
experiments
to
enhance
the
virulence
of
viruses
.
a
natural
spillover
event
was
also
not
a
possibility
,
she
insisted
last
july
,
because
there
had
been
“
zero
infection
”
of
sars-cov-2
at
the
wuhan
institute
.
the
wuhan
center
has
likewise
denied
any
infections.but
china
’
s
refusal
to
allow
an
independent
investigation
has
made
it
difficult
to
validate
these
claims
.
white
house
officials
have
stood
in
the
way
too
,
in
part
out
of
a
desire
not
to
draw
attention
to
the
government
’
s
financial
ties
to
the
wuhan
institute
and

research
,
katherine
eban
reports
for
vanity
fair.there
are
certainly
some
serious
scientists
who
think
it
’
s
a
possible
,
even
probable
explanation
.
one
is
david
relman
,
a
stanford
microbiologist
,
who
has
been
calling
for
a
more
thorough
investigation
of
the
virus
’
s
origins
since
last
year.but
to
many
scientists
,
these
details
aren
’
t
necessarily
reason
to
doubt
the
natural
origin
theory
.
after
all
,
it
took
shi
15
years
to
discover
the
source
of
sars
,
and
she
discovered
it
hundreds
of
miles
away
from
where
that
disease
first
broke
out
.
susan
weiss
,
a
virologist
and
coronavirus
expert
at
the
university
of
pennsylvania
,
cites
the
aphorism
about
what
animal
one
should
expect
from
the
sound
of
hoofbeats
.
“
you
know
the
thing
about
horses
and
zebras
,
”
she
told
the
washington
post
.
“
zoonosis
is
the
horse
,
and
the
lab
leak
is
the
zebra.
”
robert
garry
jr.
,
a
tulane
virologist
,
is
similarly
convinced
of
the
virus
’
s
natural
origin
.
“
i
think
people
are
frustrated
,
and
a
lot
of
people
are
looking
for
somebody
to
hang
this
on
,
”
he
told
the
post.increasingly
,
though
,
scientists
are
expressing
uncertainty
.
“
i
’
m
completely
open-minded
about
the
possibilities
,
”
akiko
iwasaki
,
a
yale
immunologist
,
told
the
times
.
“
there
’
s
so
little
evidence
for
either
of
these
things
,
that
it
’
s
almost
like
a
tossup.
”
and
it
could
very
well
stay
that
way
.
“
the
maddening
aspect
of
this
story
is
that
—
despite
the
big
fuss
being
made
right
now
—
the
facts
on
both
sides
are
still
incredibly
thin
,
”
the
science
journalist
and
former
times
reporter
donald
mcneil
jr.
told
the
post
.
“
this
debate
isn
’
t
over
,
and
it
won
’
t
be
until
more
facts
are
unearthed
—
if
they
ever
are.
”
no
new
hard
evidence
for
the
lab
leak
theory
has
emerged
,
but
a
few
events
helped
propel
it
back
into
the
mainstream
in
may
,
including
a
letter
in
science
magazine
from
18
scientists
calling
for
a
transparent
and
independent
investigation
into
the
origins
of
sars-cov-2
.
about
a
week
later
,
the
wall
street
journal
reported
that
according
to
u.s.
intelligence
,
three
researchers
at
the
wuhan
institute
had
sought
medical
care
for
“
symptoms
consistent
with
both
covid-19
and
common
seasonal
illness
”
in
november
2019.but
the
lab
leak
theory
has
also
attracted
interest
as
a
cautionary
tale
about
groupthink
,
political
polarization
and
overlapping
crises
of
expertise
.
in
the
united
states
,
one
of
the
theory
’
s
earliest
high-profile
promoters
was
republican
senator
tom
cotton
of
arkansas
,
a
china
hawk
and
a
loyal
ally
of
former
president
donald
trump
,
who
argued
in
february
of
2020
that
“
china
lied
”
about
the
origins
of
the
virus
and
suggested
it
had
come
from
a
“
super-lab.
”
in
short
order
,
the
trump
administration
and
his
campaign
started
suggesting
the
pandemic
was
a
chinese
plot
to
derail
his
re-election.this
politicization
of
the
inquiry
into
the
virus
’
s
origins
gave
rise
to
a
false
consensus
in
parts
of
the
press
.
“
it
is
understandable
that
authorities
,
including
public
health
experts
and
journalists
,
responded
to
the
crisis
with
initial
confusion
,
”
the
journalist
jonathan
chait
writes
.
“
but
they
erred
on
the
side
of
certainty
when
they
ought
to
have
erred
on
the
side
of
uncertainty
.
and
the
false
certainty
they
embraced
at
the
outset
of
2020
hardened
into
a
dogma
that
they
did
not
question
for
far
too
long.
”
even
starker
reversals
in
consensus
around
masking
and
aerosol
transmission
suggest
that
public-health
authorities
also
have
some
introspection
to
do
.
“
science
values
possibility
,
but
people
value
certainty
,
”
maddie
bender
writes
in
vice
.
“
so
far
,
science
communication
hasn
’
t
been
able
to
bridge
the
two
successfully
.
and
during
the
largest
public
health
crisis
of
a
generation
,
that
disconnect
has
had
disastrous
consequences.
”
one
such
consequence
is
that
the
lab
leak
theory
has
become
a
political
football
,
both
between
democrats
and
republicans
and
between
the
u.s.
and
chinese
governments
.
but
if
science
can
not
float
above
politics
,
it
must
hope
at
least
to
find
a
way
through
it
,
relman
says
,
because
the
stakes
for
public
health
are
exceedingly
high.
“
if
we
find
more
concrete
evidence
of
a
‘
spillover
’
event
with
sars-cov-2
passing
directly
from
bat
to
human
,
then
efforts
to
understand
and
manage
the
bat-human
interface
need
to
be
significantly
strengthened
,
”
he
writes
.
“
but
if
sars-cov-2
escaped
from
a
lab
to
cause
the
pandemic
,
it
will
become
critical
to
understand
the
chain
of
events
and
prevent
this
from
happening
again.

past
20
years
,
three
coronaviruses
have
adapted
to
infect
humans
and
cause
severe
respiratory
disease
:
covid-19
,
sars
and
mers
.
studies
on
each
of
these
coronaviruses
indicate
that
they
jumped
into
our
species
from
bats
or
other
mammals.four
other
coronaviruses
can
also
infect
people
,
but
they
usually
cause
only
mild
colds
.
scientists
did
not
directly
observe
these
coronaviruses
becoming
human
pathogens
,
so
they
have
relied
on
indirect
clues
to
estimate
when
the
jumps
happened
.
coronaviruses
gain
new
mutations
at
a
roughly
regular
rate
,
and
so
comparing
their
genetic
variation
makes
it
possible
to
determine
when
they
diverged
from
a
common
ancestor.the
most
recent
of
these
mild
coronaviruses
,
called
hcov-hku1
,
crossed
the
species
barrier
in
the
1950s
.
the
oldest
,
called
hcov-nl63
,
may
date
back
as
far
as
820
years.but
before
that
point
,
the
coronavirus
trail
went
cold
—
until
dr.
enard
and
his
colleagues
applied
a
new
method
to
the
search
.
instead
of
looking
at
the
genes
of
the
coronaviruses
,
the
researchers
looked
at
the
effects
on
the
dna
of
their
human
hosts.over
generations
,
viruses
drive
enormous
amounts
of
change
in
the
human
genome
.
a
mutation
that
protects
against
a
viral
infection
may
well
mean
the
difference
between
life
and
death
,
and
it
will
be
passed
down
to
offspring
.
a
lifesaving
mutation
,
for
example
,
might
allow
people
to
chop
apart
a
virus
’
s
proteins.but
viruses
can
evolve
,
too
.
their
proteins
can
change
shape
to
overcome
a
host
’
s
defenses
.
and
those
changes
might
spur
the
host
to
evolve
even
more
counteroffensives
,
leading
to
more
mutations.when
a
random
new
mutation
happens
to
provide
resistance
to
a
virus
,
it
can
swiftly
become
more
common
from
one
generation
to
the
next
.
and
other
versions
of
that
gene
,
in
turn
,
become
rarer
.
so
if
one
version
of
a
gene
dominates
all
others
in
large
groups
of
people
,
scientists
know
that
is
most
likely
a
signature
of
rapid
evolution
in
the
past.in
recent
years
,
dr.
enard
and
his
colleagues
have
searched
the
human
genome
for
these
patterns
of
genetic
variation
in
order
to
reconstruct
the
history
of
an
array
of
viruses
.
when
the
pandemic
struck
,
he
wondered
whether
ancient
coronaviruses
had
left
a
distinctive
mark
of
their
own.he
and
his
colleagues
compared
the
dna
of
thousands
of
people
across
26
different
populations
around
the
world
,
looking
at
a
combination
of
genes
known
to
be
crucial
for
coronaviruses
but
not
other
kinds
of
pathogens
.
in
east
asian
populations
,
the
scientists
found
that
42
of
these
genes
had
a
dominant
version
.
that
was
a
strong
signal
that
people
in
east
asia
had
adapted
to
an
ancient
coronavirus.but
whatever
happened
in
east
asia
seemed
to
have
been
limited
to
that
region
.
“
when
we
compared
them
to
populations
around
the
world
,
we
couldn
’
t
find
the
signal
,
”
said
yassine
souilmi
,
a
postdoctoral
researcher
at
the
university
of
adelaide
in
australia
and
a
co-author
of
the
new
study.the
scientists
then
tried
to
estimate
how
long
ago
east
asians
had
adapted
to
a
coronavirus
.
they
took
advantage
of
the
fact
that
once
a
dominant
version
of
a
gene
starts
being
passed
down
through
the
generations
,
it
can
gain
harmless
random
mutations
.
as
more
time
passes
,
more
of
those
mutations
accumulate.dr
.
enard
and
his
colleagues
found
that
the
42
genes
all
had
about
the
same
number
of
mutations
.
that
meant
that
they
had
all
rapidly
evolved
at
about
the
same
time
.
“
this
is
a
signal
we
should
absolutely
not
expect
by
chance
,
”
dr.
enard
said.they
estimated
that
all
of
those
genes
evolved
their
antiviral
mutations
sometime
between
20,000
and
25,000
years
ago
,
most
likely
over
the
course
of
a
few
centuries
.
it
’
s
a
surprising
finding
,
since
east
asians
at
the
time
were
not
living
in
dense
communities
but
instead
formed
small
bands
of
hunter-gatherers.aida
andres
,
an
evolutionary
geneticist
at
the
university
college
london
who
was
not
involved
in
the
new
study
,
said
she
found
the
work
compelling
.
“
i
’
m
quite
convinced
there
’
s
something
there
,
”
she
said.still
,
she
didn
’
t
think
it
was
possible
yet
to
make
a
firm
estimate
of
how
long
ago
the
ancient
epidemic
took
place
.
“
the
timing
is
a
complicated
thing
,
”
she
said
.
“
whether
that
happened
a
few
thousand
years
before
or
after
—
i
personally
think
it
’
s
something
that
we
can
not
be
as
confident
of.
”
scientists
looking
for
drugs
to
fight
the
new
coronavirus
might
want
to
scrutinize
the
42
genes
that
evolved
in
response
to
the
ancient
epidemic
,
dr.
souilmi
said
.
“
it
’
s
actually
pointing
us
to
molecular
knobs
to
adjust
the
immune
response
to
the
virus
,
”
he
said.dr
.
anders
agreed
,
saying
that
the
genes
identified
in
the
new
study
should
get
special
attention
as
targets
for
drugs
.
“
you
know
that
they
’
re
important
,
”
she
said
.
“
that
’
s
the
nice
thing
about
evolution.
”
the
pause
in
the
use
of
johnson
&
johnson
’
s
covid-19
vaccine
may
continue
for
a
week
to
10
days
,
after
expert
advisers
to
the
centers
for
disease
control
and
prevention
determined
on
wednesday
that
they
needed
more
time
to
assess
a
possible
link
to
a
rare
but
serious
blood-clotting
disorder.the
decision
not
to
reinstate
the
vaccine
has
painful
consequences
,
nationally
and
globally
.
it
may
further
erode
public
confidence
in
vaccination
in
general
and
slow
the
rollout
of
desperately
needed
shots
to
rural
and
underserved
areas
and
homebound
people
.
the
vaccine
is
considered
ideal
for
hard-to-reach
people
and
places
because
it
requires
only
one
shot
and
is
more
easily
stored
and
shipped
than
the
vaccines
made
by
moderna
and
pfizer-biontech
,
which
must
be
kept
at
very
low
temperatures.
“
putting
this
vaccine
on
pause
,
for
those
of
us
that
are
frontline
health
care
workers
,
has
really
been
devastating
,
”
dr.
camille
kotton
of
harvard
medical
school
told
the
panel
.
she
said
that
losing
the
johnson
&
johnson
vaccine
even
temporarily
represented
a
big
blow
to
efforts
to
stop
the
pandemic
,
especially
in
underserved
communities.the
pause
,
first
recommended
on
tuesday
by
u.s.
health
officials
,
led
johnson
&
johnson
to
delay
its
rollout
of
the
vaccine
in
europe
,
where
several
countries
were
poised
to
start
administering
it
this
week
.
the
continent
is
reeling
from
the
fallout
over
rare
cases
,
sometimes
fatal
,
of
a
similar
blood
disorder
that
has
prompted
several
nations
to
limit
or
reject
the
widespread
use
of

recommend
alternatives.south

australia
announced
it

and
the
european

indicated
that

consider
new
deals
only
with
companies
that
were
not
using
the
technology
employed
by

that
many
countries
follow
the

lead
when
it
comes
to
vaccines
,
dr.
grace
lee
of
stanford
university
,
an
expert
on
the
panel
,
said
that
although
the
committee
’
s
responsibility
was
to
the
united

,
“
i
also
feel
the
weight
of
the

that
we
also
have

the
impact

can
potentially
worsen

”
the
advisory
group
’
s
emergency
meeting
on
wednesday
was
called
to
review
the
reason
for
the
pause
:
six
cases
of
rare
and
severe
blood
clots
in
the
brain
in
women
ages
18
to
48
,
one
of
whom
died
.
all
of
the
women
had
received
the
johnson
&
johnson
vaccine
before
developing
the
clots
,
although
it
is
unclear
whether
the
vaccine
was
responsible
.
in
addition
,
the
panel
learned
of
the
clotting
problem
in
a
seventh
woman
who
received
the
vaccine
after
it
was
authorized
,
and
in
a
man
who
received
it
during
its
clinical
trials.as
of
tuesday
,
more
than
seven
million
people
in
the
united
states
had
received
the
johnson
&
johnson
shot
,
representing
about
5
percent
of
vaccinations
nationwide.advisory
meetings
usually
end
with
a
vote
on
whether
or
how
to
use
a
vaccine
.
but
in
this
case
,
the
panel
members
declined
to
vote
after
reviewing
several
options
—
including
whether
to
limit
use
of
the
vaccine
to
older
adults
,
as
many
european
nations
have
done
—
saying
that
they
did
not
have
enough
information
to
assess
the
potential
risks.doran
fink
,
an
official
of
the
food
and
drug
administration
,
proposed
a
different
strategy
to
the
panel
,
suggesting
that
the
vaccine
could
go
back
into
use
while
researchers
continued
to
study
the
potential
risk
.
doctors
and
patients
could
be
provided
with
information
about
the
findings
so
that
patients
could
consider
whether
to
accept
the
vaccine
.
“
our
current
thinking
is
that
this
risk
could
be
managed
by
inclusion
of
warning
statements
,
”
dr.
fink
said.but
some
experts
on
the
c.d.c
.
panel
leaned
in
other
directions
,
fearing
that
more
patients
could
be
harmed
if
vaccinations
resumed
without
a
full
understanding
of
the
potential
risks
.
one
warned
that
the
rare
condition
could
cause
long-lasting
neurological
damage
.
others
reminded
their
colleagues
of
the
risk
from
covid
itself
,
and
the
message
the
panel
would
send
if
it
prolonged
a
suspension
in
the
use
of
a
one-and-done
vaccine.the
advisory
committee
on
immunization
practices
,
or
acip
,
is
a
panel
of
independent
experts
who
advise
the
c.d.c
.
on
its
vaccine
policies.the
clotting
disorder
of
concern
in
the
vaccine
recipients
is
different
—
and
much
rarer
—
from
typical
blood
clots
,
which
develop
in
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
every
year
.
the
seven
women
experienced
not
only
clotting
in
the
brain
but
a
notably
low
level
of
platelets
,
parts
of
the
blood
that
help
form
normal
clots
in
response
to
an
injury.none
of
the
women
had
recently
given
birth
,
which
can
increase
the
risk
of
more
common
blood
clots
,
and
only
one
was
known
to
be
taking
hormonal
treatment
.
so
far
,
there
is
no
evidence
that
birth
control
pills
,
which
can
also
raise
the
risk
of
blood
clots
,
were
involved.three
of
the
women
had
large
,
dangerous
clots
in
other
parts
of
their
body
,
not
just
in
the
brain.the
rare
combination
of
severe
clots
and
low
platelets
stood
out
to
experts
as
a
safety
signal
.
why
it
develops
is
not
known
,
and
so
far
there
is
no
way
to
predict
whether
an
individual
is
susceptible.the
condition
is
very
similar
to
one
linked
to
the
astrazeneca
covid
vaccine
,
also
affecting
some
relatively
young
women
in
europe
,
where
that
vaccine
was
in
wide
use
.
researchers
in
germany
and
norway
found
that
patients
there
had
developed
antibodies
that
activated
their
platelets
—
an
aberrant
response
to
the
vaccine
—
setting
off
a
cascade
of
clotting
and
bleeding
.
specialized
blood
tests
can
detect
the
antibodies
to
confirm
the
diagnosis
,
and
some
of
the
u.s.
patients
tested
positive
.
not
all
were
tested.both
astrazeneca
and
johnson
&
johnson
use
adenoviruses
to
ferry
dna
into
human
cells
to
create
immunity
against
the
coronavirus
.
researchers
suspect
that
some
aspect
of
that
technology
plays
a
role
in
the
blood
disorder
.
but
they
also
emphasize
that
because
the
condition
is
so
very
rare
,
some
quirk
of
biology
very
likely
predisposes
certain
people
to
have
a
bad
reaction
to
the
vaccine
.
if
the
vaccine
alone
were
responsible
,
there
would
be
many
more
cases
,
some
researchers
say.the
vaccines
made
by
moderna
and
pfizer-biontech
employ
genetic
material
called
mrna
and
do
not
use
viruses.much
of
the
world
had
been
counting
on
the
astrazeneca
vaccine
to
fight
the
pandemic
,
but
many
countries
have
now
restricted
its
use
to
adults
older
than
30
or
50
,
and
some
have
stopped
using
it
altogether
.
some
people
who
are
still
eligible
for
it
are
declining
it
out
of
fear
.
astrazeneca
’
s
vaccine
has
not
been
authorized
in
the
united
states
,
although
the
company
is
expected
to
apply
for
permission
to
distribute
it
here.use
of
the
johnson
&
johnson
vaccine
in
the
united
states
began
on
march
2
,
and
the
first
case
of
blood
clots
in
the
brain
was
reported
on
march
19
.
about
1.4
million
women
ages
20
to
50
—
the
age
range
of
those
who
had
the
clots
—
have
received
the
vaccine.the
panel
of
experts
discussed
the
known
background
rates
of
low
platelets
and
of
the
clots
in
the
brain
—
known
as
central
venous
sinus
thrombosis
—
in
the
general
population
and
in
younger
women
like
those
who
had
the
clots
,
but
noted
that
there
was
not
enough
data
to
precisely
estimate
how
often
the
two
conditions
occurred
at
the
same
time.but
based
on
rough
estimates
,
the
clotting
disorder
in
women
ages
20
to
50
who
received
the
johnson
&
johnson
vaccine
occurred
at
least
three
times
more
often
than
would
be
expected
,
according
to
dr.
tom
shimabukuro
,
a
safety
expert
from
the
c.d.c.in
the
coming
weeks
,
he
said
,
the
rate
would
become
clearer
as
more
reports
arrived
.
“
we
’
ll
get
a
better
picture
of
what
’
s
going
on.
”
“
right
now
,
we
believe
these
events
to
be
extremely
rare
,
but
we
are
also
not
yet
certain
we
have
heard
about
all
possible
cases
,
as
this
syndrome
may
not
be
easily
recognized
as
one
associated
with
the
vaccine
,
”
dr.
rochelle
p.
walensky
,
the
c.d.c
.
director
,
said
at
a
white
house
news
conference
on
the
pandemic
on
wednesday.during
the
panel
discussion
,
experts
noted
that
the
“
risk
window
”
for
the
condition
among
vaccine
recipients
was
still
open
and
that
new
cases
might
emerge
,
because
nearly
3.8
million
people
had
received
the
shot
within
the
last
two
weeks
.
in
the
six
women
,
the
severe
clotting
developed
within
about
two
weeks
of
the
shot.other
experts
encouraged
dissemination
of
health
information
on
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
the
condition
so
that
awareness
would
spread
among
doctors
,
emergency
rooms
and
people
who
had
received
the
vaccine
.
a
key
point
is
that
the
blood-thinner
heparin
,
a
common
treatment
for
clots
,
can
harm
these
patients
and
should
not
be
used.officials
also
noted
that
people
with
the
condition
needed
to
be
treated
as
soon
as
possible
because
the
clots
were
so
serious
.
some
patients
needed
invasive
procedures
to
remove
large
clots
from
blood
vessels
in
their
brains.several
panel
members
reiterated
that
two
other
vaccines
—
from
moderna
and
pfizer-biontech
—
are
available
,
neither
associated
with
the
clotting
problem
,
so
continuing
the
pause
would
not
stop
most
people
in
the
united
states
from
being
vaccinated.at
the
news
conference
,
jeffrey
d.
zients
,
the
white
house
’
s
pandemic
coordinator
,
said
that
the
pause
would
not
generally
interrupt
the
momentum
of
the
country
’
s
vaccination
campaign.
“
in
the
very
short
term
,
we
do
expect
some
impact
on
daily
averages
as
sites
and
appointments
transition
from
johnson
&
johnson
to
moderna
and
pfizer
vaccines
,
”
he
said
.
“
we
have
more
than

”
public
health
experts
have
repeatedly
emphasized
that
the
clotting
disorder
is
rare
and
that
the
benefits
of
the
astrazeneca
and
johnson
&
johnson
vaccines
far
outweigh
their
risks
.
but
when
an
adverse
effect
has
the
potential
to
be
devastating
or
fatal
—
like
blood
clots
in
the
brain
—
some
regulators
and
segments
of
the
public
consider
the
risk
unacceptable
,
even
if
it
is
extremely
rare.the
safety
bar
for
vaccines
is
set
high
because
they
are
given
to
healthy
people
.
the
seemingly
greater
vulnerability
of
younger
people
to
the
clotting
disorder
is
of
particular
concern
,
because
their
risk
of
severe
illness
from
covid
itself
is
lower
than
that
in
older
people
.
those
differences
suggest
that
over
all
,
compared
to
older
people
,
younger
people
may
have
less
to
gain
and
more
to
lose
from
the
johnson
&
johnson
and
astrazeneca
vaccines.there
were
curious
characteristics
about
the
h1n1
influenza
pandemic
of
1977-78
,
which
emerged
from
northeastern
asia
and
killed
an
estimated
700,000
people
around
the
world
.
for
one
,
it
almost
exclusively
affected
people
in
their
mid-20s
or
younger
.
scientists
discovered
another
oddity
that
could
explain
the
first
:
it
was
virtually
identical
to
a
strain
that
circulated
in
the
1950s
.
people
born
before
that
had
immunity
that
protected
them
,
and
younger
people
didn
’
t.but
how
on
earth
had
it
remained
so
steady
genetically
,
since
viruses
continually
mutate
?
scientists
guessed
that
it
had
been
frozen
in
a
lab
.
it
was
often
found
to
be
sensitive
to
temperature
,
something
expected
for
viruses
used
in
vaccine
research.it
was
only
in
2004
that
a
prominent
virologist
,
peter
palese
,
wrote
that
chi-ming
chu
,
a
respected
virologist
and
a
former
member
of
the
chinese
academy
of
sciences
,
told
him
that
“
the
introduction
of
this
1977
h1n1
virus
”
was
indeed
thought
to
be
due
to
vaccine
trials
involving
“
the
challenge
of
several
thousand
military
recruits
with
live
h1n1
virus.
”
for
the
first
time
,
science
itself
seemed
to
have
caused
a
pandemic
while
trying
to
prepare
for
it.now
,
for
the
second
time
in
50
years
,
there
are
questions
about
whether
we
are
dealing
with
a
pandemic
caused
by
scientific
research.while
the
chinese
government
’
s
obstruction
may
keep
us
from
knowing
for
sure
whether
the
virus
,
sars-cov-2
,
came
from
the
wild
directly
or
through
a
lab
in
wuhan
or
if
genetic
experimentation
was
involved
,
what
we
know
already
is
troubling.years
of
research
on
the
dangers
of
coronaviruses
,
and
the
broader
history
of
lab
accidents
and
errors
around
the
world
,
provided
scientists
with
plenty
of
reasons
to
proceed
with
caution
as
they
investigated
this
class
of
pathogens
.
but
troubling
safety
practices
persisted.worse
,
researchers
’
success
at
uncovering
new
threats
did
not
always
translate
into
preparedness.even
if
the
coronavirus
jumped
from
animal
to
human
without
the
involvement
of
research
activities
,
the
groundwork
for
a
potential
disaster
had
been
laid
for
years
,
and
learning
its
lessons
is
essential
to
preventing
others.until
the
sars
outbreak
,
coronaviruses
were
considered
fairly
benign
,
causing
only
minor
to
moderate
colds
.
even
five
months
after
sars
emerged
in
southern
china
in
november
2002
,
the
chinese
government
was
covering
up
details
about
its
threat
,
while
the
disease
was
spreading
to
other
countries
.
by
summer
2003
,
it
had
been
contained
,
but
not
before
infecting
over
8,000
people
and
killing
774
.
officials
were
able
to
suppress
sars
because
infected
people
spread
it
when
visibly
sick
,
making
it
easier
to
identify
and
isolate
people
.
but
it
was
a
close
call
,
and
that
roughly
10
percent
case
fatality
rate
raised
alarms
.
preventing
the
next
coronavirus
pandemic
became
a
scientific
priority.by
2005
,
researchers
—
including
dr.
shi
zhengli
,
a
virologist
at
the
wuhan
institute
of
virology
—
had
identified
horseshoe
bats
as
the
likely
primary
host
animal
from
which
sars
had
emerged
.
in
the
years
that
followed
,
scientists
pursued
bat
coronaviruses
in
the
field
and
studied
them
in
the
lab.it
is
often
assumed
that
sars
was
spread
to
humans
by
palm
civets
,
an
adorable
small
mammal
sometimes
sold
at
wildlife
markets
,
though
by
2008
,
it
was
suspected
that
bat
coronaviruses
could
directly
infect
human
lung
cells
without
needing
an
intermediary
animal
.
by
2013
,
dr.
shi
’
s
lab
experiments
showed
this
could
happen.still
,
scientists
sometimes
worked
with
bats
,
bat
samples
and
bat
viruses
under
conditions
that
have
since
raised
eyebrows.it
is
in
the
nature
of
viruses
to
continually
mutate
,
with
random
accidents
altering
,
adding
or
removing
parts
of
its
genome
or
bits
of
genetic
code
being
exchanged
with
other
viruses
—
recombination
.
this
constant
trial
and
error
enables
the
emergence
of
features
that
can
allow
viruses
to
infect
a
new
species.in
order
to
anticipate
these
jumps
,
humans
have
tried
to
steer
this
process
.
in
what
is
sometimes
called
gain-of-function
research
,
they
genetically
manipulate
viruses
to
see
how
they
can
become
more
dangerous.in
an
article
in
nature
medicine
in
2015
,
researchers
from
two
of
the
major
coronavirus
laboratories
in
the
world
—
dr.
shi
;
ralph
baric
,
a
professor
at
the
university
of
north
carolina
at
chapel
hill
;
and
others
—
wrote
that
they
had
bioengineered
a
coronavirus
.
the
work
was
carried
out
in
dr.
baric
’
s
laboratory
at
u.n.c
.
they
took
a
spike
protein
,
the
“
key
”
that
coronaviruses
use
to
unlock
and
infect
cells
,
from
a
horseshoe
bat
virus
and
combined
it
with
a
human
sars
virus
adapted
for
mice
.
they
reported
that
this
“
chimeric
”
virus
could
infect
human
cells
,
suggesting
some
bat
viruses
may
be
“
capable
of
infecting
humans
without
mutation
or
adaptation.
”
this
was
the
second
time
since
dr.
shi
’
s
2013
experiments
that
a
sars-like
bat
coronavirus
showed
the
ability
in
the
lab
to
directly
infect
human
airway
cells.this
kind
of
genetic
manipulation
had
already
raised
concerns
,
especially
after
laboratories
in
the
netherlands
and
the
united
states
announced
in
2011
that
they
had
created
strains
of
flu
viruses
using
genetic
material
from
the
h5n1
influenza
a
virus
,
which
is
very
deadly
but
generally
can
’
t
yet
spread
among
people
.
these
new
strains
could
spread
by
air
among
ferrets
,
which
have
humanlike
lungs
.
the
uproar
had
been
immediate.in

of
the
2015

her
colleagues

peter
daszak

closely
with

and
has
been
granted
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
in
the
last
decade
from
the
u.s.
government
,
said
the
findings
would
allow
scientists
to
focus
on
the
greatest
risk
because
it
would
“
move
this
virus
from
a
candidate
emerging
pathogen
to
a
clear
and
present
danger.
”
others
were
more
worried
.
“
if

,
nobody
could
predict
the
trajectory

”
said
simon
wain-hobson
,
a
virologist
at
the
pasteur
institute
in
paris.recent
history
provided
plenty
of
reason
for
such
concern.nearly
every
sars
case
since
the
original
epidemic
has
been
due
to
lab
leaks
—
six

twice

30
,
2019

a
public
email
list
run
by
the
international
society
for

warned
that
an
“
unexplained
pneumonia
”
had
appeared
in

china
,
and
reports
connected
the
first
cases
to
the
city

huanan
seafood
market
.
on
jan.
10
,
2020
,
a
chinese
scientist
posted
the
genome
of
the
virus
—
soon
to
be
named
sars-cov-2
—
on
an
open
internet
depository
,
confirming
that
it
was
a
coronavirus
.
the
chinese
government
denied
that
the
virus
was
spreading
among
humans
until
jan.
19
,
2020
;
three
days
later
,
it
announced
a
complete
lockdown
of
wuhan
,
a
city
of
11
million
people.about
a
week
after
the
lockdown
,
chinese
scientists
published
a
paper
in
the
lancet
medical
journal
that
identified
bats
as
the
likely
source
of
the
virus
.
the
authors
noted
that
the
outbreak
happened
during
local
bat
hibernation
season
and
“
no
bats
were
sold
or
found
at
the
huanan
seafood
market
,
”
so
they
reasoned
that
it
may
have
been
transmitted
by
an
intermediary
animal.outbreaks
can
occur
far
from
their
source
.
the
2002
sars
outbreak
started
in
guangdong
,
about
a
thousand
kilometers
from
the
caves
in

is

,
were
cited
as
the
vehicle
that
sars
probably
used
to
travel
from
yunnan
to
guangdong
.
since
sars-cov-2
was
first
detected
at
a
market
where
live
wild
animals
may
have
been
sold
,
the
wildlife
trade
was
immediately
suspected.social
media
users
in

were
among
the
first
to
be
more
skeptical
.
did
the
spread
of
a
disease
from
bats
just
happen
to
start
in
wuhan
,
home
to
the
wuhan

of

on

,
27
prominent
scientists
published
an
open
letter
in
the
lancet
.
they
decried
“
conspiracy
theories
suggesting
that
covid-19
does
not
have
a
natural
origin.
”
as
we
consider
its
origin
,
the
question
is
not
so
much
whether
sars-cov-2
could
have
gotten
out
of
a
lab
—
accidents
happen
—
but
whether
it
could
have
gotten
in
and
how
it
would
have
been
handled
there.shortly
after
wuhan
was
locked
down
in
january
2020
,
it
became
apparent
that
sars-cov-2
was
related
to
a
virus
that
scientists
had
been
aware
of
for
years.on
feb.
3
,
2020
,
dr.
shi
and
co-authors
announced
in
nature
that
they
had
found
a
virus
in
their
database
,
ratg13
,
whose
genome
sequence
was
96.2
percent
identical
to
sars-cov-2
and
was
previously
detected
in
horseshoe
bats
of
yunnan.suspicious
internet
sleuths
combed
through
genomic
databases
and
found
that
ratg13
was
an
exact
match
for
a

coronavirus
called

retrieved
from
a
cave
implicated
in
an
unexplained
outbreak
of
pneumonia
in
2012
among
miners
who
collected
bat
guano
from
a
mine
in
yunnan
.
three
of
the
six
miners
died.in
may
2020
,
a
former
science
teacher
from
india
,
with
the
twitter
pseudonym
theseeker268
,
found
a
2013
master
’
s
thesis
,
as
well
as
a
2016
ph.d.
thesis
,
supervised
by
george
fu
gao
,
the
current
director
of
the
chinese
center
for
disease
control
and
prevention
.
the
master
’
s
thesis
hypothesized
that
the
miners
’
illness
was
caused
by
direct
transmission
of
a
sars-like
coronavirus
from
a
horseshoe
bat
.
the
ph.d.
thesis
was
more
cautious
but
still
called
the
outbreak
“
notable.
”
it
also
revealed
that
a
team
from
the
wuhan
institute
of
virology
had
collected
bat
samples
from
the
cave
.
the
dissertation
noted
that
all
four
of
the
miners
who
were
tested
for
sars
antibodies
had
them
in
their
blood
a
few
weeks
after
they
became
ill.none
of
those
crucial
facts
—
the
name
change
or
the
link
to
the
previous
fatal
outbreak
possibly
from
a
sars-like
coronavirus
—
were
mentioned
in
the
original
paper
about
ratg13
.
in
an
interview
published
in
march
2020
,
dr.
shi
said
fungus
was
the
pathogen
that
had
sickened
the
miners
,
not
a
coronavirus.the
questions
persisted.last
july
,
dr.
shi
confirmed
that
ratg13
was
indeed
4991
renamed
.
in
november
2020
,
her
paper
in
nature
was
finally
updated
,
additionally
acknowledging
what
sleuths
had
also
uncovered
:
her
team
genetically
sequenced
ratg13
in
2018
.
(
the
possible
bat
coronavirus
link
to
the
miner
deaths
was
still
not
acknowledged
.
)
the
less
than
forthcoming
disclosure
—
a
virus
with
two
names
,
the
connection
to
a
deadly
outbreak
,
shifting
diseases
and
inconsistent
stories
—
fueled
suspicions.some
speculated
whether
ratg13
had
been
subjected
to
gain-of-function-type
manipulation
to
create
sars-cov-2
.
but
ratg13
is
more
like
a
distant
cousin
of
sars-cov-2
,
meaning
it
is
unlikely
to
have
produced
sars-cov-2
as
an
offspring
,
either
through
recent
evolution
in
the
wild
or
manipulation
in
the
lab.even
if
ratg13
had
no
role
in
the
covid-19
outbreak
,
questions
were
raised
about
why
dr.
shi
and
others
seemed
so
unforthcoming
about
it
.
then
more
questions
were
raised.for
example
,
the
same
group
of
internet
sleuths
that
linked
ratg13
to
the
mine
also
uncovered
that
a
genomic
database
maintained
by
the
wuhan
institute
of
virology
,
with
information
about
thousands
of
bat
samples
and
at
least
500
recently
discovered
bat
coronaviruses
,
went
offline
in
september
2019
.
the
official
explanation
—
that
it
was
taken
offline
because
it
had
been
subjected
to
hacking
—
doesn
’
t
explain
why
it
was
never
securely
shared
some
other
way
with
responsible
independent
researchers.such
gaps
made
it
harder
to
rule
out
worrying
scenarios
.
if
there
had
been
a
lab
accident
involving
sars-cov-2
or
a
virus
like
it
that
had
been
collected
in
the
wild
or
experimented
on
in
the
lab
,
the
database
might
have
been
taken
down
so
there
would

the

that

led
to

that
the

leaked
from

,
which
makes

since
,
for

bioweapons

shi
’
s
scientific
work
was

on
collecting
and
analyzing

of

and
it
was
her
work
that
showed
the
dangers
associated
with
this
endeavor
.
the
2013
paper
by
dr.
shi
,
dr.
daszak
and
others
demonstrated
that
a
live
bat
coronavirus
from
a
yunnan
sample
could
bind
to
human
lung
cell
receptors
,
showing
that
“
intermediate
hosts
may
not
be
necessary
for
direct
human
infection.
”
that
controversial
2015
experiment
co-authored
by
a
group
of
researchers

included
dr.
baric

dr.

carried
out
after
they
had
found
another
bat
coronavirus
they
suspected
could
infect
humans
,
but
it
was
difficult
to
cultivate
.
they
then
created
that
chimeric
one
using
its
spike
.
they
showed
that
it
,
too
,
could
infect
human
airway

directly.in

dr.

’

lab
sampled
over
200
people
living
within
a

miles
of
two
yunnan
bat
caves

found
that
six
tested
positive
for

antibodies
,
indicating
past
infection

all
six
reported
having
seen
bats
and
only
20
people
in

had
reported
seeing
bats
flying
close
to
their
homes
,
suggesting
exposure
created
a
great
risk
of
infection.the
research
practices
,
however
,
may
not
have
always
incorporated
these
lessons.while
a

the
caution
of

later
that

a

showed
researchers
handling
bats

bat
feces
with
their
bare

with

a

”
in

dr.

said
that
the

was
“
not
as
dangerous
”
as
everyone
thought
.
“
the
chance
of
directly
infecting
humans
is
very
small
,
”
she
wrote
.
“
in
most
cases
only
ordinary
protection
will
be
taken
,
”
unless
a
bat
was
known
to
carry
a
virus
that
might
infect
humans
.
she
repeated
something
similar
in
a
2018
ted

noting
that
“
simpler
protection
”
—
illustrated
with

surgically
masked

was
appropriate
because
it
was
believed
that

usually
required

last
month
a
former

of

administration
,
scott
gottlieb
,
said
this
failure
added
to
the
evidence
of
a
lab
leak
,
although
dr.
daszak
suggested
that
investigators
look
further
,
at
wildlife
farms
in
southern
china.but
if
bat-to-human
transmission
is
how
the
spillover
happened
,
no
intermediary
animal
is
necessary
,
since
it
could
have
been
any
interaction
with
a
bat
—
by
a
villager
or
a
field
researcher.despite
widespread
assertions
that
bat
viruses
need
an
intermediary
animal
to
spread
to
humans
,
research
is
not
even
settled
on
whether
the
palm
civet
spread
sars
to
humans
from
bats
.
we
do
know
that
palm
civets
amplified
the
outbreak
once
sars
arrived
in
the
guangdong
market
and
that
back-and-forth
transmission
between
humans
and
civets
was
possible
.
however
,
the
only
widespread
infected
civet
populations
that
researchers
found
were
those
at
urban
markets
and
sometimes
at
farms
—
where
people
are
—
and
not
in
the
wild
.
we
know
we
can
infect
animals

million

it
’
s
possible
that
humans
were
the
initial
intermediary
animal
for
civets
and
that
the
cute
little
creatures
were
framed.other
sources
of
risk
were
the
lab
activities
themselves.there
has
been
a
lot
of
speculation
that
sars-cov-2
was
the
result
of
genetic
engineering
.
this
hypothesis
can
not
be
ruled
out
based
on
genomic
analysis
alone
,
and
suspicion
has
grown
because
of
the
opaque
response
by
chinese
authorities.they
have
refused
to
share
direct
records
from
the
lab
.
dr.
shi
echoed
this
stance
in
may
when
a
group
of
scientists
,
including
her
co-author
dr.
baric
,
pushed
for
broader
transparency
.
“
it
’
s
definitely
not
acceptable
,
”
she
emailed
a
reporter
in
response
to
the
group
’
s
request
to
see
her
lab
’
s
records.meanwhile
,
throughout
december
2019
,
wuhan
doctors
suspected
that
a
sars-like
virus
was
on
the
loose
,
and
the
local
government
arrested
whistle-blowers
,
including
at
least
one
health
care
worker
.
the
cover-up
by
communist
party
officials
continued
until
the
prominent
sars
scientist
zhong
nanshan
traveled
to
wuhan
on
jan.
18
and
raised
the
alarm.that
said
,
circumstantial
evidence
casts
some
doubt
on
the
claim
that
sars-cov-2
was
bioengineered.for
instance
,
aspects
of
the
virus
that
have
made
some
suspect
it
was
bioengineered
could
also
be
evidence
that
the
virus
evolved
naturally
.
a
lot
of
attention
has
been
drawn
to
an
unusual
feature
on
its
spike
protein
called
a
furin
cleavage
site
,
with
which
the
virus
can
better
infect
a
human
cell
.
it
’
s
one
of
several
odd
features
of
sars-cov-2
that
are
weird
enough
that
even
virologists
who
greatly
doubt
lab
involvement
told
me
they
were
shocked
to
see
it
.
in
fact
,
even
beyond
the
furin
cleavage
site
,
sars-cov-2
was
a
virus
that
scientists
had
never
seen
before
.
evolution
can
be
a
random
accumulation
of
weird
,
novel
features
.
for
the
research
on
viruses
that
scientists
like
dr.
shi
do
for
high-level
scientific
publications
,
such
a
combination
would
be
incongruous
.
their
work
usually
involves
examining
or
changing
one
element
of
a
virus
at
a
time
to
find
out
what
each
element
does
and
can
be
made
to
do
.

having

even
if
we
put
aside

,
regular
lab
work
at
the
wuhan
labs
has
raised
concerns.in
2016
the
wuhan
institute
reported
experimenting
on
a
live
bat
coronavirus
that
could
infect
human
cells
in
a

michael

an

,
told
me
it
was
“
an

”
that
a
sars-like

capable
of
replicating
in

worked
on
under

undetected

“

this
leaves
a

of
confusion.since

have
occurred
since

,
aids
and
the
h1n1
swine
flu
of
2009
,
were
not.plus
,
once
a
rare
event
,
like
a
pandemic
,
has
happened
,
one
has
to
consider
all
the
potential
paths
to
it
.
it
’
s
like
investigating
a
plane
crash
.
flying
is
usually
very
safe
,
but
when
a
crash
does
happen
,
we
don
’
t
just
say
mechanical
errors
and
pilot
mistakes
don
’
t
usually
lead
to
catastrophes
and
that
terrorism
is
rare
.
rather
,
we
investigate
all
possible
paths
,
including
unusual
ones
,
so
we
can
figure
out
how
to
prevent
similar
events.perhaps
the
biggest
question
has
been
what
to
read
into
the
location
of
the
outbreak
,
a
thousand
miles
from
the
closest
known
viral
relatives
yet
close
to
a
leading
research
institution.sometimes
the
curiosity
around
the
location
has
been
waved
away
with
the
explanation
that
labs
are
set
up
where
viruses
are
.
however
,
the
wuhan
institute
of
virology
has
been
where
it
is
since
1956
,
doing
research
on
agricultural
and
environmental
microbiology
under
a
different
name
.
it
was
upgraded
and
began
to
focus
on
coronavirus
research
only
after
sars
.
wuhan
is
a
metropolis
with
a
larger
population
than
new
york
city
’
s
,
not
some
rural
outpost
near
bat
caves
.
dr.
shi
said
the
december
2019
outbreak
surprised
her
because
she
“
never
expected
this
kind
of
thing
to
happen
in
wuhan
,
in
central
china.
”
when
her
lab
needed
a
population
with
a
lower
likelihood
of
bat
coronavirus
exposure
,
they
used
wuhan
residents
,
noting
that
“
inhabitants
have
a
much
lower
likelihood
of
contact
with
bats
due
to
its
urban
setting.
”
still
,
location
itself
is
not
proof
,
either
.
plausible
scenarios
implicating
research
activities
don
’
t
rule
out
other
options.this
week
,
jesse
bloom
,
an
associate
professor
at
the
fred
hutchinson
cancer
research
center
,
told
me
that
when
he
recovered
and
analyzed
a
set
of
partial
early
wuhan
genetic
sequences
that
had
been
removed
from
a
genomic
archive
,
it
supported
“
substantial
existing
evidence
that
sars-cov-2
was
circulating
in
wuhan
prior
to
the
seafood
market
outbreak.
”
both

early
reports
from
chinese
scientists

the

recent

investigation
this
winter
found
many
of
the
early
cases
had
no
connection
to
the
seafood
market
,
including
the
earliest
acknowledged
case
so
far
,
on
dec.
8
,
2019
.
so
the
seafood
market
may
not
have
been
the
original
location
of
the
outbreak.it
’
s
also
plausible
that
an
outbreak
could
have
started
someplace
else
and
was
detected
in
wuhan
simply
because
it
was
a
big
city
.
testing
blood
banks
from
across
china
,
especially
in
areas
near
wildlife
farms
and
bat
caves
,
would
help
,
but
with
limited
exceptions
,
the
chinese
government
has
not
carried
out
such
research
—
or
allowed
the
sharing
of
the
results
if
it
has.with
so
much
evidence
withheld
,
it
’
s
hard
to
say
anything
about
covid-19
’
s
origins
with
certainty
,
and
even
a
genuine
investigation
would
face
challenges
.
some
outbreaks
have
never
been
traced
to
their
origin.but
even
if
we
are
denied
answers
,
we
can
still
learn
lessons.perhaps
the
biggest
one
is
that
we
were
due
for
a
bat
coronavirus
outbreak
,
one
way
or
another
,
and
the
research
showing
bat
coronaviruses
’
ability
to
jump
to
humans
was
a
warning
not
heeded.scientists
and
government
officials
need
to
weigh
the
benefits
and
dangers
of
how
we
work
with
bats
and
viruses
,
in
the
field
and
the
lab
,
especially
since
other
public
health
investments
may
do
much
more
to
prevent
a
pandemic
.
it
might
be
more
effective
to
institute
rigorous
surveillance
where
threatening
pathogens
are
known
to
thrive
,
and
better
prepare
our
institutions
to
react
quickly
and
transparently
to
the
first
sign
of
an
outbreak
.
research
can
be
weighted
toward
response
rather
than
prediction
;
these
overlap
but
aren
’
t
identical
.
finding
a
dangerous
virus
in
a
cave
or
a
petri
dish
might
be
useful
,
but
it
’
s
a
bit
like
poking
a
bear
we
are
trying
to
avoid.field
research
on
bats
should
have
been
done
more
carefully
.
bat
viruses
should
not
be
studied
in
bsl-2
labs
,
and
research
in
bsl-3
labs
should
be
done
only
under
the
strictest
caution
.
bats
should
be
treated
as
a
serious
threat
in
labs
.
human
interactions
with
bats
should
occur
under
strict
regulation
and
surveillance.alison
young
,
an
investigative
reporter
who
has
long
covered
lab
incidents
,
wrote
that
from
2015
to
2019
,
there
were
more
than
450
reported
accidents
with
pathogens
that
the
federal
government
regulates
because
of
their
danger
.
comparable
rates
of
incidents
were
found
in
british
labs
—
and
research
suggests
lab
accidents
are
not
even
always
reported.some
scientists
have
proposed
imposing
stricter
controls
and
a
stronger
risk-benefit
analysis
for
research
on
pathogens
that
could
inadvertently
spark
pandemics
.
some
research
may
still
be
worth
it
,
and
there
have
been
proposals
to
move
such
labs
outside
densely
populated
cities.cooperation
with
china
on
these
issues
is
vital
,
including
on
lab
safety
and
outbreak
surveillance
.
some
argue
that
criticizing
china
’
s
response
to
the
pandemic
and
the
scientific
practices
that
might
have
led
to
it
will
imperil
that
cooperation
.
it
’
s
hard
to
see
how
angry
op-eds
could
make
chinese
officials
more
intransigent
than
they
already
are.people
are
understandably
wary
that
these
claims
might
demonize
scientists
from
other
countries
,
especially
given
the
anti-asian
racism
that
has
abounded
.
but
why
would
perpetuating
this
state
of
events
be
to
their
benefit
?
after
a
lab
accident
with
anthrax
bacteria
in
the
soviet
union
in
1979
that
killed
dozens
,
leading
western
scientists
accepted
the
soviet
government
’
s
excuses
,
which
all
turned
out
to
be
lies
.
that
doesn
’
t
help
lead
to
better
safety
standards
,
including
those
that
would
benefit
scientists
in
authoritarian
countries.but
a
better
path
forward
is
one
of
true
global
cooperation
based
on
mutual
benefit
and
reciprocity
.
despite
the
current
dissembling
,
we
should
assume
that
the
chinese
government
also
doesn
’
t
want
to
go
through
this
again
—
especially
given
that
sars
,
too
,
started
there.this
means
putting
the
public
interest
before
personal
ambitions
and
acknowledging
that
despite
the
wonders
of
its
power
,
biomedical
research
also
holds
dangers.to
do
this
,
government
officials
and
scientists
need
to
look
at
the
big
picture
:
seek
comity
and
truth
instead
of
just
avoiding
embarrassment
.
develop
a
framework
that
goes
beyond
blaming
china
,
since
the
issues
raised
are
truly
global
.
and
realize
that
the
next
big
thing
can
simply
mean
taking
great
care
with
a
lot
of
small
details.when
did
the
coronavirus
arrive
in
the
united
states
?
the
first
infection
was
confirmed
on
jan.
21
,
2020
,
in
a
resident
of
washington
state
who
had
recently
returned
from
wuhan
,
china
.
soon
after
,
experts
concluded
that
the
virus
had
been
in
the
country
for
weeks.a
study
published
on
tuesday
offers
new
evidence
:
based
on
an
analysis
of
blood
tests
,
scientists
identified
seven
people
in
five
states
who
may
have
been
infected
well
before
the
first
confirmed
cases
in
those
states
.
the
results
suggest
that
the
virus
may
have
been
circulating
in
illinois
,
for
example
,
as
early
as
dec.
24
,
2019
,
although
the
first
case
in
that
state
was
confirmed
a
month
later.but
the
new
study
is
flawed
,
some
experts
said
:
it
did
not
adequately
address
the
possibility
that
the
antibodies
were
to
coronaviruses
that
cause
common
colds
,
and
the
results
could
be
a
quirk
of
the
tests
used
.
in
addition
,
the
researchers
also
did
not
have
travel
information
for
any
of
the
patients
,
which
might
have
helped
explain
the
test
results.
“
this
is
an
interesting
paper
because
it
raises
the
idea
that
everyone
thinks
is
true
,
that
there
were
infections
that
were
going
undiagnosed
,
”
said
scott
hensley
,
an
immunologist
at
the
university
of
pennsylvania.but
the
small
number
of
samples
that
tested
positive
made
it
difficult
to
be
sure
that
they
were
true
cases
of
infection
and
not
just
a
methodological
error
.
“
it
’
s
hard
to
know
what
is
a
real
signal
and
what
isn
’
t
,
”
he
said.if
the
findings
are
accurate
,
however
,
then
they
underscore
the
notion
that
poor
testing
in
the
united
states
missed
most
cases
during
the
early
weeks
of
the
pandemic.
“
without
testing
,
you
can
’
t
see
what
’
s
going
on
,
”
said
keri
althoff
,
an
epidemiologist
at
the
johns
hopkins
bloomberg
school
of
public
health
and
lead
author
of
the
study
.
“
in
these
earlier
months
in
some
of
these
states
where
we
were
not
suspecting
,
there
was
a
lot
of
infection
going
on
there.
”
it
is
not
a
surprise
that
there
may
have
been
undocumented
cases
early
in
the
pandemic
,
said
sarah
cobey
,
an
evolutionary
biologist
at
the
university
of
chicago
.
experts
“
already
knew
that
was
the
case
from
studying
trends
in
excess
mortality
and
hospitalizations
,
”
she
said.dr
.
cobey
’
s
most
recent
model
estimated
that
there
were
roughly
10,000
infections
in
illinois
on
march
1
,
2020
.
“
given
the
horrible
state
of
testing
,
there
was
never
any
doubt
we
were
missing
most
early
transmission
,
”
she
added.in
the
study
,
published
in
the
journal
clinical
infectious
diseases
,
dr.
althoff
and
her
colleagues
analyzed
blood
samples
from
more
than
24,000
people
.
they
found
nine
people
who
had
donated
blood
between
jan.
2
and
march
18
of
last
year
who
appeared
to
have
antibodies
to
the
coronavirus.seven
of
the
samples
came
from
blood
donated
before
the
date
of
the
first
diagnosis
in
their
states
—
illinois
,
wisconsin
,
pennsylvania
,
mississippi
and
massachusetts
.
the
results
are
consistent
with
those
of
another
study
that
identified
coronavirus
antibodies
in
blood
donated
as
early
as
mid-december
2019.the
participants
were
enrolled
in
a
long-term
national
institutes
of
health
project
,
called
all
of
us
,
that
aims
to
include
a
million
people
in
the
united
states
in
order
to
increase
the
representation
of
minorities
in
research
.
only
about
half
of
the
people
in
the
study
were
white.early
in
the
pandemic
,
the
virus
would
have
infected
very
few
people
.
a
low
prevalence
increases
the
odds
that
an
antibody
test
mistakenly
identifies
a
sample
as
having
antibodies
when
it
does
not
,
dr.
hensley
said
—
a
false
positive.the
researchers
tried
to
minimize
that
possibility
by
using
two
antibody
tests
in
sequence
.
the
first
test
flagged
147
samples
as
possibly
having
antibodies
to
the
coronavirus
;
the
second
slashed
that
number
down
to
nine.the
team
also
analyzed
1,000
samples
of
blood
from
the
2018-19
cold
and
flu
season
,
and
found
none
that
tested
positive
for
antibodies
to
the
coronavirus.
“
it
’
s
still
very
possible
that
some
of
them
might
be
false
positives
,
”
said
dr.
josh
denny
,
chief
executive
of
all
of
us
.
but
“
the
fact
that
all
of
them
would
be
false
positives
seems
pretty
unlikely
with
what
we
’
ve
done.
”
the
researchers
said
they
planned
to
contact
the
participants
to
ask
about
travel
history
and
would
continue
to
analyze
additional
samples
to
estimate
when
the
coronavirus
reached
american
shores.
“
the
exact
month
at
which
it
probably
came
into
the
u.s.
is
still
unknown
,
”
dr.
althoff
said
.
“
it
’
s
essentially
a
puzzle
right
now
,
and
our
study
is
just
one
piece
of
that
puzzle.
”
the
most
widely
used
coronavirus
vaccines
are
designed
as
two-shot
inoculations
,
and
nearly
everyone
worldwide
who
has
had
both
doses
has
received
the
same
vaccine
both
times.but
that
is
changing
,
as
more
countries
are
allowing
—
and
even
,
in
some
cases
,
encouraging
—
mix-and-match
inoculation
,
with
people
receiving
a
first
shot
of
one
vaccine
,
and
then
a
second
shot
of
a
different
one
.
on
tuesday
,
germany
’
s
government
revealed
that
chancellor
angela
merkel
had
received
two
different
shots
,
adding
to
the
growing
interest
in
the
practice.some
nations
have
tried
that
approach
out
of
necessity
,
when
supplies
of
a
particular
vaccine
ran
short
;
or
out
of
caution
,
when
questions
were
raised
about
the
safety
of
a
shot
after
some
people
had
already
received
their
first
doses
.
u.s.
regulators
so
far
have
been
reluctant
to
encourage
the
practice.but
scientists
and
health
policymakers
are
interested
in
the
possibility
that
giving
different
shots
to
the
same
person
could
have
significant
advantages.here
are
some
common
questions
raised
by
mix-and-match
vaccination.mixing
vaccines
—
scientists
call
it
“
heterologous
prime-boost
”
—
is
not
a
new
idea
,
and
researchers
have
experimented
with
it
in
fighting
a
handful
of
other
diseases
,
like
ebola.scientists
have
long
theorized
that
giving
people
two
slightly
different
vaccines
might
generate
a
stronger
immune
response
,
perhaps
because
the
vaccines
stimulate
slightly
different
parts
of
the
immune
system
or
teach
it
to
recognize
different
parts
of
an
invading
pathogen.
“
the
argument
is
that
one
and
one
makes
three
,
”
said
john
moore
,
a
virologist
at
weill
cornell
medicine
.
“
how
well
that
argument
holds
up
in
practice
in
the
covid
area
is
going
to
need
to
be
judged
by
the
actual
data.
”
in
addition
to
the
potential
immunological
benefits
,
mixing
and
matching
also
“
offers
much-needed
flexibility
when
vaccine
supplies
are
uneven
or
limited
,
”
said
zhou
xing
,
an
immunologist
at
mcmaster
university
in
canada.multiple
clinical
trials
are
currently
underway
to
determine
whether
there
are
benefits
or
drawbacks
.
researchers
at
the
university
of
oxford
are
testing
different
combinations
of
vaccines
—
including
the
astrazeneca-oxford
,
pfizer-biontech
,
moderna
and
novavax
shots
—
in
the
com-cov
trial
,
and
the
u.s.
national
institutes
of
health
recently
launched
a
trial
of
mixed
booster
doses.russian
researchers
are
testing
a
combination
of
their
sputnik
v
vaccine
and
the
astrazeneca
shot
.
sputnik
is
,
itself
,
somewhat
based
on
a
mix-and-match
approach
,
with
the
first
and
second
shots
having
different
formulations.most
studies
are
still
in
early
stages
,
but
some
have
released
promising
preliminary
results
.
last
month
,
for
instance
,
a
team
of
spanish
researchers
announced
that
people
who
received
a
dose
of
the
astrazeneca
vaccine
,
followed
by
a
dose
of
the
pfizer
vaccine
,
showed
a
robust
immune
response.this
regimen
appeared
to
elicit
a
stronger
immune
response
than
two
doses
of
the
astrazeneca
vaccine
,
dr.
xing
said
.
whether
it
is
better
than
two
doses
of
the
pfizer
vaccine
is
not
yet
clear.preliminary
data
from
the
com-cov
study
suggests
that
mixing
and
matching
vaccines
may
increase
the
odds
of
mild
and
moderate
side
effects
,
including
fever
,
fatigue
and
headache.the
data
suggest
that
a
mismatched
regimen
“
might
have
some
short-term
disadvantages
,
”
the
researchers
wrote
,
although
it
is
also
possible
that
the
side
effects
may
be
a
sign
of
a
strong
immune
response
.
most
side
effects
faded
within
48
hours
,
they
found.overall
,
scientists
say
that
they
expect
the
data
to
show
that
the
approach
is
safe
.
“
as
we

learned
in
18
months
of

suggested
that

were
in

reports
of

resumed

when

remained
deeply
skeptical

it

slowing
the

,
the

able

”
mr.

told

on

recommended
in

had
received

follow
it
up
with

relaxed
that
advice
this

ms.

got
the

a

u.s.
federal
health
regulators
recommended
a
pause
in
the
use
of
johnson
&
johnson
’
s
covid-19
vaccine
while
they
investigated
six
reports
of
blood
clots
in
women
ages
18
to
48
.
one
has
died
,
and
a
second
is
hospitalized
in
critical
condition.on
wednesday
,
two
more
cases
were
added
to
the
list
:
a
seventh
woman
who
received
the
vaccine
after
it
was
authorized
,
and
a
man
who
received
it
during
a
clinical
trial.seven
of
the
eight
had
blood
clots
in
the
brain.as
of
thursday
,
7.4
million
people
in
the
united
states
had
received
the
vaccine
without
any
other
serious
adverse
reactions
reported.experts
have
yet
to
determine
to
what
extent
,
if
any
,
the
vaccine
is
responsible
for
the
clots
.
but
the
investigation
follows
actions
by
european
regulators
who
concluded
that
a
vaccine
made
by
astrazeneca
may
also
be
the
cause
of
a
similar
,
extremely
rare
clotting
disorder.u.s
.
and
european
public
health
experts
have
emphasized
that
for
most
people
,
the
benefits
of
the
covid
vaccines
far
outweigh
the
risks
.
several
countries
in
europe
last
week
restricted
use
of
the
astrazeneca-oxford
vaccine
to
older
adults
because
rare
cases
of
a
blood
disorder
were
occurring
in
younger
people
.
some
countries
chose
not
to
use
it
,
and
the
european
medicines
agency
has
decided
not
to
renew
contracts
with
astrazeneca
or
johnson
&
johnson
.
the
astrazeneca
vaccine
has
not
been
authorized
in
the
united
states.the
number
of
cases
is
small
.
if
there
is
indeed
a
risk
of
blood
clots
from
the
vaccine
—
which
has
yet
to
be
determined
—
that
risk
is
extremely
low
.
the
risk
of
getting
covid-19
in
the
united
states
is
far
higher.so
far
,
the
overall
risk
appears
to
be
about
one
case
per
million
vaccinations
.
but
for
women
20
to
50
,
it
may
be
higher
.
dr.
tom
shimabukuro
,
a
safety
expert
at
the
c.d.c.
,
said
on
wednesday
that
the
risk
for
women
in
the
age
range
appeared
to
be
at
least
three
times
the
rate
that
would
normally
be
expected
.
but
he
said
that
figure
was
a
rough
estimate.the
f.d.a
.
recommends
that
people
who
have
received
the
johnson
&
johnson
vaccine
within
the
past
three
weeks
should
contact
their
doctors
if
they
experience
severe
headaches
,
abdominal
pain
,
leg
pain
or
shortness
of
breath
.
doctors
seeing
people
with
those
symptoms
,
particularly
if
the
patients
are
young
women
,
should
ask
if
they
recently
received
a
covid
vaccination
,
dr.
anthony
fauci
,
the
biden
administration
’
s
chief
science
adviser
,
said
at
a
news
briefing
on
tuesday.people
should
not
be
concerned
about
mild
headaches
and
flu-like
symptoms
in
the
first
few
days
after

are
common
,

effects

on

against
the
coronavirus.for
people
who
received
the
vaccine
a
month
or
two
ago
,
the
issue
being
raised
about
clots
“
doesn
’
t
mean
anything
,
”
dr.
fauci
said
.
the
six
cases
occurred
within
a
“
pretty
tight
window
”
of
six
to
13
days
after
people
received
the
shot
,
he
said.during
clinical
trials
and
after
vaccines
go
into
wide
use
,
experts
keep
track
of
any
medical
problems
experienced
by
people
who
receive
them
.
if
an
unusually
large
cluster
of
cases
turns
up
,
regulators
may
decide
to
pause
a
trial
or
stop
the
use
of
a
vaccine
to
investigate
further.pauses
are
common
,
and
typically
the
investigations
reveal
that
the
medical
problems
were
a
matter
of
coincidence
.
if
the
investigation
reveals
that
a
vaccine
does
pose
a
risk
,
regulators
may
write
new
guidance
about
who
should
or
should
not
receive
it
.
the
pause
also
gives
them
time
to
advise
doctors
about
how
to
recognize
and
treat
the
condition.in
this
instance
,
the
food
and
drug
administration
and
the
centers
for
disease
control
and
prevention
are
recommending
a
pause
,
and
states
have
already
heeded
the
agencies

advice

among
businesses

stopping
use
of
the

are

and
walgreens.in
a

conference
on
tuesday
,
federal

said
that

would
likely
take
only
a
matter
of
days
.
but
a
c.d.c
.
advisory
panel
on
wednesday
extended
the
pause
,
by
deciding
to
make
no
recommendation
about
the
vaccine
for
at
least
a
week
,
so
they
could
gather
more
information
about
the
clotting
problem.seven
women
in
the
united
states
who
received
the
johnson
&
johnson
vaccine
,
and
one
man
who
received
it
in
a
clinical
trial
,
developed
a
rare
disorder
involving
blood
clots
within
about
two
weeks
of
vaccination
.
in
seven
of
the
eight
with
the
condition
,
called

formed
in

that
drain

from
the
brain
.
the
results
are
“
stroke-like
,
”
dr.
anne
schuchat
of
the
c.d.c
.
said.researchers
studying
a
very
similar
disorder
in
astrazeneca
recipients
in
europe
say
it
appears
to
be
caused
by
an
intense
reaction
to
the
vaccine
by
the
immune
system
,
which
generates
antibodies
that
activate
platelets
,
a
blood
component
that
helps
form
normal
clots
to
repair
wounds
.
in
addition
to
clots
,
abnormal
bleeding
occurs
.
european
researchers
have
called
the
disorder
identified
there
“
vaccine-induced
immune
thrombotic
thrombocytopenia.
”
dr

peter
marks
of
the

.
said
it
was
the
unusual
combination
of
clotting
and
bleeding
that
set
up
a
red
flag
for
regulators
as
a
possible
safety
signal.so
far
,
researchers
have
not
found
a
way
to
predict
who
will
develop
the
disorder
and
have
not
identified
any
underlying
condition
that
might
indicate
susceptibility.dr
.
fauci
said
that
if
scientists
could
identify
some
common
underlying
trait
in
the
women
who
developed
the
clots
,
it
might
help
to
determine
who
is
at
risk
and
enable
regulators
to
establish
categories
of
people
who
should
not
receive
the

with

have
said
,
roughly
one
in
1,000
people
are
affected
by
a
blood
clot
in
a

every
year.but
the
clotting
disorder
of
concern
in

is
much
rarer

to

in
the

—
called

venous
sinus

,

for
short
—
the

had
a

left

is
so
rare

european

they
concluded
that
the

was
a
very
rare

effect

it

too
early

regulators
had
recommended
that
recipients
of

medical
assistance
for
a
number
of
possible

,
including
swelling
in

tiny

was
given.but
that
set
of
symptoms
was
so
vague
that
almost
immediately
,
british
emergency
rooms
experienced
a
surge
in
patients
who
were
worried

they
fit

in

have
treated

with
blood-thinning
drugs
to
try
to
stop
the
growth
of
the

,
and
with
intravenous
immune

,
which
can
help
eliminate
the
misguided
antibodies
that
are
causing

there

u.s.
federal
health
officials
on
tuesday
advised
against
using
a
common
blood
thinner
,
heparin
,
and
recommended
choosing
alternative
medicines
instead
.
the
reason
is
that
the
disorder
closely
resembles
a

by

,
and
it
is
possible
that

“

when

,
his
tone
was
different.
“
the

uniformly
looks
good
right
now
,
”
he
said
.
the
country
is
averaging
below
15,000

the
lowest
since
testing
became
widely
available
,
and
cases
continue
to
decline
rapidly
.
deaths
are
falling
,
as
are
hospitalizations.
“
this
feels
very
different
than
other
moments

declined

”
mitch
said
.
“
recently
,
they

declined

lot
,
they

ve
declined
just
about
everywhere
,
and
a
very
large
percentage
of
people
are
now
vaccinated

so
this
does
feel
like
an
extremely
hopeful
moment

something

seeing

experts
are

that

this

however
,
if
there
is

surge
,
it

be
as

as

,
experts
say
,
because
many
people
are

other
big
mystery
is
the

of
the

david

many

i
asked
my
colleague
carl
zimmer
what
we
know
so
far.how
do
covid-19
vaccines
stack
up
in
terms
of
protection
?
early
signs
are
encouraging
.
researchers
have
been
drawing
blood
from
volunteers
in
vaccine
trials
and
measuring
their
levels
of
antibodies
and
immune
cells
that
target
the
coronavirus
.
the
levels
are
dropping
,
but
gradually
.
it
’
s
possible
that
with
this
slow
rate
of
decline
,
vaccine
protection
will
remain
strong
for
a
long
time
.
people
who
were
previously
infected
and
then
received
the
vaccine
may
enjoy
even
more
durable
protection.will
some
covid
vaccines
last
longer
than
others
?
scientists
have
already
found
that
vaccines
using
different
technologies
can
vary
in
their
effectiveness
.
the
strongest
vaccines
include
moderna
and
pfizer-biontech
,
both
of
which
are
based
on
rna
molecules
.
vaccines
relying
on
inactivated
viruses
,
such
as
those
made
by
sinopharm
in
china
and
bharat
biotech
in
india
,
have
proved
somewhat
less
effective.how
will
we
know
when
our
vaccines
are
losing
their
effectiveness
?
scientists
are
searching
for
biological
markers
that
could
reveal
when
the
protection
from
a
vaccine
is
no
longer
enough
to
hold
back
the
coronavirus
.
it
’
s
possible
that
a
certain
level
of
antibodies
marks
a
threshold
:
if
your
blood
measures
above
that
level
,
you
’
re
in
good
shape
,
but
if
you
’
re
below
it
,
you
’
re
at
greater
risk
of
infection.what
about
the
variants
?
the
emergence
of
variants
in
recent
months
has
accelerated
research
on
boosters
.
some
variants
have
mutations
that
lead
them
to
spread
swiftly
.
others
carry
mutations
that
might
blunt
the
effectiveness
of
authorized
vaccines
.
but
at
this
point

scientists
still
have
only
a
smattering
of
clues

”
news
headlines
and
health
experts
on
social
media
are
sounding
the
alarm
over
another
variant
of
the
coronavirus
,
this
time
delta
,
claiming
it
is
much
more
contagious
and
perhaps
more
lethal
than
any
other
variant
seen
so
far
.
it
’
s
easy
to
understand
why
:
new
variants
of
the
virus
continue
to
emerge
,
and
cases
are
rising
in
many
countries
.
but
whether
new
variants
pose
a
unique
or
substantial
risk
is
still
unknown
,
and
as
virologists
,
we
are
concerned
that
misunderstanding
variants
and
the
risk
they
pose
can
cause
confusion
and
panic.as
the
coronavirus
spread
globally
,
its
genome
changed
—
mutated
—
as
expected
for
any
virus
.
these
mutations
may
affect
the
virus
’
s
“
fitness
,
”
its
ability
to
reproduce
and
spread
.
some
mutations
weaken
a
virus
,
some
have
no
measurable
effect
,
and
some
make
it
stronger.as
a
virus
becomes
more
fit
,
it
will
outcompete
less
fit
viruses
—
and
delta
is
not
the
first
variant
that
has
beat
its
predecessors
and
competitors
in
certain
areas
.
there
’
s
the
alpha
variant
that
first
became
dominant
in
britain
,
and
the
gamma
variant
that
first
became
dominant
in
brazil
.
such
changes
are
not
unique
to
the
coronavirus
.
increased
viral
fitness
happens
during
every
flu
season
and
is
why
some
flu
variants
may
circulate
more
widely
than
others.just
because
a
variant
displaces
another
does
not
necessarily
mean
it
is
more
infectious
or
more
deadly
to
the
people
who
become
infected
with
it
.
as
has
been
true
for
the
past
year
and
a
half
,
human
behavior
is
far
more
important
in
shaping
the
course
of
the
pandemic
than
any
variant.there
are
many
ways
that
a
virus
can
mutate
to
increase
its
fitness
.
while
there
’
s
been
much
focus
on
changes
in
the
virus
’
s
spike
proteins
,
which
allow
the
coronavirus
to
invade
cells
,
a
virus
can
also
sustain
changes
in
other
proteins
.
such
changes
can
allow
the
virus
to
replicate
more
easily
or
evade
the
immune
system
,
for
example
.
they
may
even
allow
the
virus
to
persist
longer
in
nasal
passages.determining
what
impact
a
given
mutation
has
requires
substantial
laboratory
research
.
sometimes
,
early
conclusions
about
a
particular
mutation
can
be
incorrect
.
when
the
first
variant
of
note
,
d614g
,
emerged
last
winter
,
some
scientists
believed
changes
to
the
virus
’
s
spike
protein
made
the
virus
more
contagious
.
but
subsequent
research
showed
that
was
not
the
case
.
even
so
,
each
time
a
new
change
in
the
spike
protein
is
identified
,
many
experts
presume
the
variant
is
more
virulent
and
“
of
concern.
”
but
whether
any
variant
is
biologically
more
transmissible
or
causes
more
severe
illness
has
not
been
rigorously
tested.right
now
,
conclusions
about
variant
transmissibility
are
based
largely
on
how
widespread
the
variant
is
.
a
variant
might
be
deemed
more
contagious
because
it
makes
up
a
higher
proportion
of
new
infections
.
delta
is
now
the
most
common
variant
in
india
and
britain
,
accounting
for
more
than
90
percent
of
new
cases
,
and
over
20
percent
of
new
infections
in
the
united
states
.
not
all
virologists
,
including
us
,
agree
that
measurements
like
this
are
sufficient
to
declare
a
variant
more
transmissible
or
more
contagious
.
what
’
s
clear
is
delta
may
be
the
fitter
and
dominant
variant
for
now.to
determine
increased
transmissibility
,
the
ability
of
the
virus
to
be
passed
on
from
one
person
to
another
,
requires
more
than
measuring
infection
rates
.
it
may
require
experiments
in
people
,
which
are
unethical
to
conduct.changes
in
people
’
s
activities
contribute
to
the
rise
of
infections
—
such
as
travel
,
failure
to
mask
and
to
adhere
to
physical
distancing
policies
,
and
most
important
right
now
,
insufficient
vaccination
—
and
these
are
often
not
considered
in
public
discussion
of
variants.the
huge
infection
numbers
in
india
,
nigeria
and
other
places
are
not
necessarily
because
of
a
particular
variant
,
but
in
large
part
because
of
breached
containment
measures
and
crowded
populations
with
poor
public
health
infrastructures
.
if
people
are
in
situations
in
which
they
can
be
infected
with
the
coronavirus
,
it
’
s
highly
likely
they
will
be
infected
with
the
fittest
variant
in
the
area
.
right
now
,
in
many
places
,
that
’
s
delta.what
’
s
important
to
understand
is
that
people
infected
with
the
variants
do
not
necessarily
develop
more
severe
disease
or
die
more
frequently
from
the
coronavirus
,
and
it
is
essential
to
get
vaccinated.the
coronavirus
vaccines
that
have
been
developed
are
very
effective
in
preventing
severe
disease
and
death
caused
by
all
variants
,
including
delta
.
vaccines
might
not
always
prevent
infections
,
but
they
make
a
substantial
impact
in
reducing
virus
spread
and
risk
for
serious
health
problems
.
people
who
are
unvaccinated
are
at
a
great
risk
for
infection
and
harm
from
any
variant
of
the
coronavirus.during
a
pandemic
,
a
time
of
unknowns
,
people
want
immediate
answers
to
the
question
,
what
does
this
mutation
mean
?
providing
the
correct
answers
may
require
years
of
research
.
for
now
,
there
’
s
little
evidence
that
the
virus
is
on
an
endless
trajectory
of
increased
transmission
and
virulence
.
today
’
s
vaccines
can
still
end
this
pandemic.the
vaccines
made
by
pfizer-biontech
and
moderna
set
off
a
persistent
immune
reaction
in
the
body
that
may
protect
against
the
coronavirus
for
years
,
scientists
reported
on
monday.the
findings
add
to
growing
evidence
that
most
people
immunized
with
the
mrna
vaccines
may
not
need
boosters
,
so
long
as
the
virus
and
its
variants
do
not
evolve
much
beyond
their
current
forms
—
which
is
not
guaranteed
.
people
who
recovered
from
covid-19
before
being
vaccinated
may
not
need
boosters
even
if
the
virus
does
make
a
significant
transformation.
“
it
’
s
a
good
sign
for
how
durable
our
immunity
is
from
this
vaccine
,
”
said
ali
ellebedy
,
an
immunologist
at
washington
university
in
st.
louis
who
led
the
study
,
which
was
published
in
the
journal
nature.the
study
did
not
consider
the
coronavirus
vaccine
made
by
johnson
&
johnson
,
but
dr.
ellebedy
said
he
expected
the
immune
response
to
be
less
durable
than
that
produced
by
mrna
vaccines.dr
.
ellebedy
and
his
colleagues
reported
last
month
that
in
people
who
survived
covid-19
,
immune
cells
that
recognize
the
virus
lie
quiescent
in
the
bone
marrow
for
at
least
eight
months
after
infection
.
a
study
by
another
team
indicated
that
so-called
memory
b
cells
continue
to
mature
and
strengthen
for
at
least
a
year
after
infection.based
on
those
findings
,
researchers
suggested
that
immunity
might
last
for
years
,
possibly
a
lifetime
,
in
people
who
were
infected
with
the
coronavirus
and
later
vaccinated
.
but
it
was
unclear
whether
vaccination
alone
might
have
a
similarly
long-lasting
effect.dr
.
ellebedy
’
s
team
sought
to
address
that
question
by
looking
at
the
source
of
memory
cells
:
the
lymph
nodes
,
where
immune
cells
train
to
recognize
and
fight
the
virus.after
an
infection
or
a
vaccination
,
a
specialized
structure
called
the
germinal
center
forms
in
lymph
nodes
.
this
structure
is
an
elite
school
of
sorts
for
b
cells
—
a
boot
camp
where
they
become
increasingly
sophisticated
and
learn
to
recognize
a
diverse
set
of
viral
genetic
sequences.the
broader
the
range
and
the
longer
these
cells
have
to
practice
,
the
more
likely
they
are
to
be
able
to
thwart
variants
of
the
virus
that
may
emerge.
“
everyone
always
focuses
on
the
virus
evolving
—
this
is
showing
that
the
b
cells
are
doing
the
same
thing
,
”
said
marion
pepper
,
an
immunologist
at
the
university
of
washington
in
seattle
.
“
and
it
’
s
going
to
be
protective
against
ongoing
evolution
of
the
virus
,
which
is
really
encouraging.
”
after
infection
with
the
coronavirus
,
the
germinal
center
forms
in
the
lungs

but
after
vaccination
,
the
cells
’
education
takes
place
in
lymph
nodes
in
the
armpits
,
within
reach
of
researchers.dr
.
ellebedy
and
his
colleagues
recruited
41
people
—
including
eight
with
a
history
of
infection
with
the
virus
—
who
were
immunized
with
two
doses
of
the
pfizer-biontech
vaccine
.
from
14
of
these
people
,
the
team
extracted
samples
from
the
lymph
nodes
at
three
,
four
,
five
,
seven
and
15
weeks
after
the
first
dose.that
painstaking
work
makes
this
a
“
heroic
study
,
”
said
akiko
iwasaki
,
an
immunologist
at
yale
.
“
this
kind
of
careful
time-course
analysis
in
humans
is
very
difficult
to
do.
”
dr
.
ellebedy
’
s
team
found
that
15
weeks
after
the
first
dose
of
vaccine
,
the
germinal
center
was
still
highly
active
in
all
14
of
the
participants
,
and
that
the
number
of
memory
cells
that
recognized
the
coronavirus
had
not
declined.
“
the
fact
that
the
reactions
continued
for
almost
four
months
after
vaccination
—
that
’
s
a
very
,
very
good
sign
,
”
dr.
ellebedy
said
.
germinal
centers
typically
peak
one
to
two
weeks
after
immunization
,
and
then
wane.
“
usually
by
four
to
six
weeks
,
there
’
s
not
much
left
,
”
said
deepta
bhattacharya
,
an
immunologist
at
the
university
of
arizona
.
but
germinal
centers
stimulated
by
the
mrna
vaccines
are
“
still
going
,
months
into
it
,
and
not
a
lot
of
decline
in
most
people.
”
dr
.
bhattacharya
noted
that
most
of
what
scientists
know
about
the
persistence
of
germinal
centers
is
based
on
animal
research
.
the
new
study
is
the
first
to
show
what
happens
in
people
after
vaccination.the
results
suggest
that
a
vast
majority
of
vaccinated
people
will
be
protected
over
the
long
term
—
at
least
,
against
the
existing
coronavirus
variants
.
but
older
adults
,
people
with
weak
immune
systems
and
those
who
take
drugs
that
suppress
immunity
may
need
boosters
;
people
who
survived
covid-19
and
were
later
immunized
may
never
need
them
at
all.exactly
how
long
the
protection
from
mrna
vaccines
will
last
is
hard
to
predict
.
in
the
absence
of
variants
that
sidestep
immunity
,
in
theory
immunity
could
last
a
lifetime
,
experts
said
.
but
the
virus
is
clearly
evolving.
“
anything
that
would
actually
require
a
booster
would
be
variant-based
,
not
based
on
waning
of
immunity
,
”
dr.
bhattacharya
said
.
“
i
just
don
’
t
see
that
happening.
”
people
who
were
infected
with
the
coronavirus
and
then
immunized
see
a
major
boost
in
their
antibody
levels
,
most
likely
because
their
memory
b
cells
—
which
produce
antibodies
—
had
many
months
to
evolve
before
vaccination.the
good
news
:
a
booster
vaccine
will
probably
have
the
same
effect
as
prior
infection
in
immunized
people
,
dr.
ellebedy
said
.
“
if
you
give
them
another
chance
to
engage
,
they
will
have
a
massive
response
,
”
he
said
,
referring
to
memory
b
cells.in
terms
of
bolstering
the
immune
system
,
vaccination
is
“
probably
better
”
than
recovering
from
the
actual
infection
,
he
said
.
other
studies
have
suggested
that
the
repertoire
of
memory
b
cells
produced
after
vaccination
is
more
diverse
than
that
generated
by
infection
,
suggesting
that
the
vaccines
will
protect
better
against
variants
than
natural
immunity
alone.dr
.
ellebedy
said
the
results
also
suggested
that
these
signs
of
persistent
immune
reaction
might
be
caused
by
mrna
vaccines
alone
,
as
opposed
to
those
made
by
more
traditional
means
,
like
johnson
&
johnson
’
s.but
that
is
an
unfair
comparison
,
because
the
johnson
&
johnson
vaccine
is
given
as
a
single
dose
,
dr.
iwasaki
said
:
“
if
the
j
&
j
had
a
booster
,
maybe
it
will
induce
this
same
kind
of
response.

australian
officials
on

introduced
a
strict
two-week
lockdown
for
all
of

and
the
regions
surrounding
the
nation
’
s
largest
city.the
first
full-city
lockdown
for
sydney
since
early
2020
reflects
a
sudden
rise
in
concern
among
officials
in
the
state
of
new
south
wales
,
who
had
been
hoping
that
contact
tracers
and
targeted
isolation
would
be
enough
to
keep
the
more
contagious
variant
under
control.instead
,
after
initially
resisting
a
full
lockdown
,
officials
said
on
saturday
that
strict
citywide
stay-at-home
orders
were
necessary
because
they
had
found
several
additional
chains
of
transmission
around
the
city
among
people
who
had
been
infectious
for
days.gladys
berejiklian
,
the
state
premier
,
said
the
virus
was
simply
moving
too
quickly
through
the

over

10
days
,
a
cluster
that
began
with
an

has
jumped
to
nearly

more
expected
over

,
”
ms.

told
a
news
conference
on
saturday
.
“
unfortunately
,
we
have
to.
”
she
said
that
a
shorter
lockdown
would
not
be
enough
to
regain
control
over
transmission
,
describing
the
delta
variant
as
spreading
far
faster
than
other
strains
of
the
coronavirus.
“
unless
you
stay
a
step
ahead
of
this
virus
,
it
can
very
easily
get
out
of
control

she
said.starting

people
across

paris
—
secretary
of
state
antony
j.
blinken
,
speaking
in
an
interview
after
a
meeting
with
president
emmanuel
macron
of
france
,
said
the
united
states
and
france
were
“
on
the
same
page
”
in
their
determination
to
resist
the
possibility
of
a
chinese-led
world
order
that
would
be
“
profoundly
illiberal
in
nature.
”
on
his
first
visit
as
secretary
to
france
,
where
he
lived
for
nine
years
in
his
youth
and
attended
high
school
,
mr.
blinken
said
“
our
purpose
is
not
to
contain
china
”
or
“
try
to
hold
china
back.
”
but
when
it
comes
to
defending
a
free
and
open
international
order
,
“
we
will
stand
up.
”
the
alternative
,
he
suggested
,
was
either
no
order
—
a
world
of
chaos
that
“
inevitably
leads
to
conflict
and
that
almost
inevitably
brings
us
in
”
—
or
chinese
domination
.
the
challenge
for
democracies
was
“
to
deliver
for
their
people
and
hopefully
for
people
around
the
world
”
in
order
to
reinforce
a
model
challenged
in
recent
years
by
its
own
internal
fractures
and
by
rising
autocracies.
“
and
i
found
that
president
macron
was
thinking
in
exactly
the
same
way
and
focused
on
the
need
to
bring
practical
results
,
”
mr.
blinken
said.mr

blinken
’
s
pleasure
at
being
back
in

evident
.
at
a
meeting
earlier
in

,
france

foreign
minister
,
jean-yves
le
drian
,
greeted
the

as
“
my

tony
”
and
said
,
“
welcome
home.
”
asked
about
this
,
mr.
blinken
said
,
“
oh
yes
,
it
is
a
sacred
home
for
me
.
i
was
here
from
age
9
to
18

i
had
a
life-changing
experience.
”
having
said
thursday
in
berlin
that
the
united
states
has
“
no
better
friend
in
the
world
than
germany
,
”
he
said
he
would
say
the
same
thing
about
france
.
as
he
turned
to
the
foundations
of
america
’
s
oldest
alliance
,
mr.
blinken
’
s
emotion
was
evident.
“
it
comes
down
to
something
pretty
basic
,
”
he
said
.
“
you
know
,
we
throw
out
a
lot
of
words
and
we
just
kind
of
say
them
by
rote
.
but
at
our
best
,
our
countries
have
worked
to
actually
give
meaning
to
liberty
,
equality
,
fraternity
.
they
’

tried
to
give
meaning
to

they

to
give

they

tried
to
give
meaning
to

”
he
continued
:
“
and
ultimately
—
obviously
there
are
differences
of
culture
,
of
history
,
of
so
many
things
—
but
when
it
comes
to
a
basic
set
of
shared
values
,
there
are
few
countries
that
are
closer.
”
this
amounted
to
a
deeply
felt
personal
call
for
france
and
the
united
states
to
renew
their
bond
by
standing
together
at
a
time
of

from

”
in
mr.

s
words.nevertheless
,
the
convergence
of
american
and

views
was
a
little
surprising
in
that

expressed
relief
that

“
the

”
after
six
rounds

nuclear
talks

and
no
agreement
to
revive
the
2015
iran
nuclear
deal
,
which
mr.

abandoned
,
mr.

said
that
the
progress
of
iran

nuclear
program
could
become
an
insurmountable
obstacle.
“
if
this
continues
,
if
they
continue
to
spin

we
will
get

return
to

he
said.
“
i
can

put
a

”
mr.

of
the
day
when

walk
away
from

getting

le

,
mr.

warned
that
“
serious
differences
”
persist
with
tehran
over
its
nuclear
program

that
preventing
an
iranian
nuclear
weapons
capability
remains
in

meeting
next

in
italy
with
the
new
israeli
foreign

,
yair
lapid
,
mr.

said
one
aim
was
to
“
try
to
rebuild
a
little
bit
more
trust

confidence
between
israelis
and
palestinians
so
that
at
some
point
the
conditions
may
exist
to
actually
to
move
forward
again
on
negotiations
,
on
a
lasting
peace.

biden

supported

well
as

he
added
,
“

we

mr.

dr

said
he
had
been
working
with
the
african
american
community
in
atlanta
,
where
preachers
have
been
instrumental
in
persuading
their
congregants
to
get
vaccinated.experts
know
that
one
way
to
address
vaccine
hesitancy
is
for
individual
doctors
to
recommend
vaccination
,
or
offer
the
vaccine
to
patients
who
may
come
in
for
other
reasons.mr
.
biden
also
used
his
speech
to
acknowledge
the
distrust
in
the
black
community
about
the
vaccine.when
coronavirus
vaccines
were
introduced
in
the
past
year
,
researchers
tracked
a
rise
in
social
media
posts
about
the
infamous
tuskegee
study
in
which
health
officials
followed
african
american
men
infected
with
syphilis
but
did
not
treat
them.mr
.
biden
noted
that
people
of
color
received
more
than
half
of
the
roughly
six
million
shots
administered
at
federally
run
mass
vaccination
sites.
“
the
more
we
close
the
racial
gap
in
vaccinations
,
the
more
lives
we
can
save
,
”
he
said.the
push
for
vaccinations
has
also
run
into
reluctance
among
many
conservatives
,
who
cite
a
variety
of
worries
including
religious
concerns
and
distrust
of
the
government.on
thursday
,
mr.
biden
’
s
focus
was
on
young
people.just
over
one-third
of
adults
ages
18
to
39
reported
being
vaccinated
,
according
to
a
report
released
on
monday
by
the
centers
for
disease
control
and
prevention
.
those
who
were
24
or
younger
,
as
well
as
non-hispanic
black
people
and
those
with
lower
incomes
,
less
education
and
no
health
insurance
,
had
the
lowest
reported
vaccination
rates
and
expressed
the
least
interest
in
getting
vaccinated
,
the
report
said.mr
.
biden
made
clear
on
thursday
that
he
would
need
the
help
of
those
listening
to
him
in
the
community
center.
“
i
have
faith
in
your

,
”
he
said.he
is
also
relying

his
closest
advisers

where
dr.

and

greeted
health
care
workers
and
those
who
were
waiting
for
shots.
“
see
how
easy
that
was
?
”
dr.
biden
said
after
a

received
a

and
a

card.teenagers

the

that

new

strongly
favors
the

,
her
father
angrily
opposes
it
and
has
threatened
to
sue
her

if
elizabeth
gets
the
shot
.
elizabeth
is
keeping
her
secret
not
only
from
her

,
but
also
her

,
so
her

can
have
plausible

the
vaccination
of
children
is
crucial
to
achieving
broad
immunity
to
the
coronavirus
and
returning
to
normal
school
and
work
routines
.
but
though
covid
vaccines
have
been
authorized
for
children
as
young
as
12
,
many
parents
,
worried
about
side
effects
and
frightened
by
the
newness
of
the
shots
,
have
held
off
from
permitting
their
children
to
get
them.a
recent
poll
by
the
kaiser
family
foundation
found
that
only
three
in
10
parents
of
children
between
the
ages
of
12
through
17
intended
to
allow
them
to
be
vaccinated
immediately
.
many
say
they
will
wait
for
long-term
safety
data
or
the
prod
of
a
school
mandate
.
but
with
many
teenagers
eager
to
get
shots
that
they
see
as
unlocking
freedoms
denied
during
the
pandemic
,
tensions
are
crackling
in
homes
in
which
parents
are
holding
to
a
hard
no.forty
states

parental
consent
for

)
now
,
because
of
the
covid
crisis
,
some
states

cities
are
seeking
to
relax
medical

emulating

prevents
some

the

and
doctors
may
perform
certain
medically
necessary
procedures
without
parental
permission
on
even
younger
children
,
a
bill
in
the

would
explicitly
bar
providers
from
giving
the

.

according
to
the

,
which
has
been

covid-related

,
some
states
,
including
tennessee

alabama
,
are
working
on
legislation
to
prevent
public
schools
from
requiring
covid

issue
of
who
can
consent
to
the
covid
shots
is
providing
fresh
context
for
decades-old
legal
,
ethical
and
medical
questions
.
when
parents
disagree
,
who
is
the
arbiter
?
at
what
age
are
children
capable
of
making
their
own
health
decisions
and
how
should
that
be
determined
?

as
both

unfold
,
those
administering

in
his
health
system
,
a

can
send

to
be
vaccinated
.
but
because
the
covid

is
authorized

new
york

image

they
hope
to
lure
10
million
visitors
to
the
city
for
overnight
stays
or
day
trips
between
memorial
day
and
labor
day.with
most
international
travel
still
closed
off
,
the
vast
majority
of
those
visitors
will
be
domestic
vacationers
,
not
the
higher
spending
foreign
tourists
.
but
after
the
pandemic
virtually
wiped
out
the
city
’
s
booming
tourism
industry
and
forced
many
of
its
big
hotels
to
shut
their
doors
,
any
and
all
visitors
are
welcome.
“
what
we
realized
is
that
we
need
to
create
an
urgency
to
visit
now
,
”
said
fred
dixon
,
the
chief
executive
of
nyc
&
company
.
he
said
that
the
agency
’
s
surveys
of
residents
of
the
northeast
showed
that
people
“
were
very
keen
and
eager
to
return
to
the
city
,
but
they
were
looking
for
the
sign
that
it
is
the
right
time.
”
that
sign
will
come
in
the
form
of
the
city
’
s
biggest
advertising
campaign
in
decades
,
including
national
tv
ads
with
the
theme
“
it
’
s
time
for
new
york
city.
”
still
in
production
but
scheduled
to
start
appearing
in
two
weeks
,
those
ads
will
be
aimed
at
persuading
americans
who
might
otherwise
have
gone
to
europe
or
elsewhere
overseas
to
consider
spending
some
time
—
and
money
—
in
new
york
instead.the
first
video
ad
cuts
quickly
through
scenes
of
unmasked
new
yorkers
at
play
,
from
the
new
york
botanical
garden
in
the
bronx
to
the
beach
in
the
rockaways
and
asks
,
“
where
were
you

’

?
”
“
the
summer
of
n.y.c
.
is
here
and
now
it
’
s
time
to
tell
the
whole
world
about
how
this
city
is
building
a
recovery
for
all
of
us
,
”
said
mayor
bill
de
blasio
.
“
tourism
impacts
hundreds
of
thousands
of
jobs
across
the
five
boroughs
,
and
its
return
will
fuel
our
recovery
even
more.
”
the
agency
’
s
efforts
to
attract
tourists
had
been
increasingly
successful
through
2019
,
when
the
city
recorded
an
all-time
high
of
66
million
visitors
.
at
its
peak
,
the
tourism
industry
employed
more
than
280,000
workers
—
about
one
of
every
14
jobs
in
the
city
—
according
to
the
state
comptroller
’
s
office.nyc
&
company
counts
anyone
who
travels
from
more
than
50
miles
away
as
a
visitor
,
but
it
places
a
higher
value
on
overnight
guests
.
most
valued
of
all
are
visitors
from
overseas
because
they
tend
to
stay
longer
and
to
spend
more
money
in
hotels
,
restaurants
,
stores
and
attractions.but
almost
all
of
the
city
’
s
biggest
foreign
sources
of
visitors
,
including
china
and
brazil
,
are
still
prohibiting
trips
to
the
united
states
.
this
year
,
mexico
has
been
the
leading
source
of
international
tourists
,
mr.
dixon
said
.
he
said
he
hopes
that
canada
and
the
united
kingdom
start
allowing
their
citizens
to
resume
traveling
freely
to
the
united
states
soon
,
and
that
once
that
happens
,
the
agency
will
start
broadcasting
its
ads
there.the
delayed
restart
of
most
international
travel
caused
nyc
&
company
to
revise
its
projection
for
visitors
this
year
down
slightly
,
to
36.1
million
,
from
a
previous
estimate
of
36.4
million
,
mr.
dixon
said.but
he
said
the
agency
predicts
visitors
will
rise
to
58.9
million
in
2022
and
surpass
65
million
again
in
2023
,
due
in
part
to
pent-up
demand
.
the
elimination
of
many
pandemic
rules
,
the
plunge
in
infection
rates
and
the
high
rate
of
vaccinations
are
all
expected
to
lead
to
more
tourists.as
part
of
its
campaign
,
nyc

company
is
also
teaming
up
with
aaa
to
pitch
the
city
as
a
road-trip
destination
and
preparing
a
sweepstakes
to
give
away
trips
to
the
city
,
mr.
dixon
said.the
effort
was
made
possible
by
an
allocation
of
pandemic
aid
the
city
received
from
the
american
rescue
plan
act
that
congress
passed
this
spring
.
that
money
supplemented
the

’
s
budget
,
which
is
funded
by
the
city
and
dues
paid
by
hotels
and
other

that

the
outlook
for
the
city
’
s
hotel

,
which
depends
on
extended

is
not

since
being
declared
a
global

,
covid-19
has
ravaged
many
countries
worldwide
,
overwhelming
many
healthcare
systems
.
the

has
also
resulted
in
the
loss

due

,
which
have
had
a
rippling

.
even
though
substantial

a
better
understanding
of
sars-cov-2
and
the
management
of

,
limiting
the
continuing

has
become
an
issue
of
increasing

,
as

across
the

,
with
many
countries
enduring
a
second

third
wave
of
outbreaks
of
this
viral
illness
attributed
mainly
due
to
the
emergence
of

of
the

.
like
other
rna
viruses
,
sars-cov-2
,
while
adapting
to
their
new
human
hosts
,
is
prone
to
genetic
evolution
with
the
development
of
mutations
over
time
,
resulting
in
variants
that
may
have
different
characteristics
than
its
ancestral
strains
.
several
variants
of
sars-cov-2
have
been
described
during
the
course
of
this
pandemic
,
among
which
only
a
few
are
considered
variants
of
concern
(
vocs
)
,
given
their
impact
on
public
health
.
the
b.1.1.7
lineage
(

)
variant
was
the
first
voc
described
in
the
united

in

,
and
subsequently
,
the
b.1.351

a

and
more
recently
,

despite
the
unprecedented
speed
of
vaccine

against
the

of
covid-19
and
robust
global
mass
vaccination
efforts
,
the
emergence
of
these

threatens
to
overturn
the
significant

coronaviruses
(
covs
)
are
positive-stranded
rna
(
+ssrna
)
viruses
with
a
crown-like
appearance
under
an
electron
microscope
(
coronam
is
the
latin
term
for
crown
)
due
to
the
presence
of
spike
glycoproteins
on
the
envelope
.
the
subfamily
orthocoronavirinae
of
the
coronaviridae
family
(
order
nidovirales
)
classifies
into
four
genera
of
covs
:
betacov
genus
is
further
divided
into
five
sub-genera
or
lineages
.
[

]
genomic
characterization
has
shown
that
bats
and
rodents
are
the
probable
gene
sources
of
alphacovs
and
betacovs
.
on
the
contrary
,
avian
species
seem
to
represent
the
gene
sources
of
deltacovs
and
gammacovs
.
covs
have
become
the
major
pathogens
of
emerging
respiratory
disease
outbreaks
.
members
of
this
large
family
of
viruses
can
cause
respiratory
,
enteric
,
hepatic
,
and
neurological
diseases
in
different
animal
species
,
including
camels
,
cattle
,
cats
,
and
bats
.
for
reasons
yet
to
be
explained
,
these
viruses
can
cross
species
barriers
and
can
cause
,
in
humans
,
illness
ranging
from
the
common
cold
to
more
severe
diseases
such
as
mers
and
sars
.
to
date
,
seven
human
covs
(
hcovs
)
capable
of
infecting
humans
have
been
identified
.
some
of
hcovs
were
identified
in
the
mid-1960s
,
while
others
were
only
detected
in
the
new
millennium
.
in
general
,
estimates
suggest
that
2
%
of
the
population
are
healthy
carriers
of
a
covs
and
that
these
viruses
are
responsible
for
about
5
%
to
10
%
of
acute
respiratory
infections
.
[

sars-cov-2
is
a
novel
betacov
belonging
to
the
same
subgenus
as
the
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
sars-cov
)
and
the
middle
east
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
mers-cov
)
,
which
have
been
previously
implicated
in
sars-cov
and
mers-cov
epidemics
with
mortality
rates
up
to
10
%
and
35
%
,
respectively

it
has
a
round
or
elliptic
and
often
pleomorphic
form
and
a
diameter
of
approximately
60–140
nm
.
like
other
covs
,
it
is
sensitive
to
ultraviolet
rays
and
heat
.
in
this
regard
,
although
high
temperature
decreases
the
replication
of
any
species
of
virus
.
currently
,
the
inactivation
temperature
of
sars-cov-2
must
be
well
elucidated
.
it
appears
that
this
virus
can
be
inactivated
at
about
27°
c.
conversely
,
it
may
resist
lower
temperatures
even
below
0°c
.
also
,
these
viruses
can
be
effectively
inactivated
by
lipid
solvents
,
including
ether
(
75
%
)
,
ethanol
,
chlorine-containing
disinfectant
,
peroxyacetic
acid
,
and
chloroform
except
for
chlorhexidine.genomic
characterization
of
the
new
hcov
,
isolated
from
a
cluster-patient
with
atypical
pneumonia
after
visiting
wuhan
,
had
89
%
nucleotide
identity
with
bat
sars-like-covzxc21
and
82
%
with
that
of
human
sars-cov
.
hence
,
it
was
termed
sars-cov-2
by
experts
of
the
international
committee
on
taxonomy
of
viruses
.
the
single-stranded
rna
genome
of
sars-cov-2
contains
29891
nucleotides
,
encoding
for
9860
amino
acids
.
although
the
origin
of
sars-cov-2
is
currently
unknown
,
it
is
widely
postulated
to
have
originated
from
an
animal
implicating
zoonotic
transmission
.
genomic
analyses
suggest
that
sars-cov-2
probably
evolved
from
a
strain
found
in
bats
.
the

between
the
human

with

more
than
1.34

population
in
the
world—will
have
difficulty
in
controlling
the
transmission
of

acute

coronavirus

among
its
population
.
multiple
strategies
would
be
highly
necessary
to
handle
the
current
outbreak
;
these
include
computational
modeling
,
statistical
tools
,
and
quantitative
analyses
to
control
the
spread
as
well
as
the
rapid
development
of
a
new
treatment
.
the
ministry
of
health
and
family
welfare
of
india
has
raised
awareness
about
the
recent
outbreak
and
has
taken
necessary
actions
to
control
the
spread
of
covid-19
.
the
central
and
state
governments
are
taking
several
measures
and
formulating
several
wartime
protocols
to
achieve
this
goal
.
moreover
,
the
indian
government
implemented
a
55-days
lockdown
throughout
the
country
that
started
on
march
25th
,
2020
,
to
reduce
the
transmission
of
the
virus
.
this
outbreak
is
inextricably
linked
to
the
economy
of
the
nation
,
as
it
has
dramatically
impeded
industrial
sectors
because
people
worldwide
are
currently
cautious
about

(

coronavirus
is
responsible
for
both
sars
and
covid-19
diseases
;
they
affect
the
respiratory
tract
and
cause
major
disease
outbreaks
worldwide
.
sars
is
caused
by
sars-cov
,
whereas
sars-cov-2
causes
covid-19
.
so
far
,
there
is
no
particular
treatment
available
to
treat
sars
or
covid-19
.
in
the
current
search
for
a
covid-19
cure
,
there
is
some
evidence
that
point
to
sars-cov-2
being
similar
to
human
coronavirus
hku1
and
229e
strains
(
11
,
12
)
even
though
they
are
new
coronavirus
family
members
.
these
reports
suggest
that
humans
do
not
have
immunity
to
this
virus
,
allowing
its
easy
and
rapid
spread
among
human
populations
through
contact
with
an
infected
person
.
sars-cov-2
is
more
transmissible
than
sars-cov
.
the
two
possible
reasons
could
be
(
i
)
the
viral
load
(
quantity
of
virus
)
tends
to
be
relatively
higher
in
covid-19-positive
patients
,
especially
in
the
nose
and
throat
immediately
after
they
develop
symptoms
,
and
(
ii
)
the
binding
affinity
of
sars-cov-2
to
host
cell
receptors
is
higher
than
that
of
sars-cov
(
13
,

)
.

other
comparisons
between
sars
and

are
tabulated

differences
between
coronavirus
disease
and
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome.as
per
the
official
government
guidelines
,
india
is
making
preparations
against
the
covid-19
outbreak
,
and
avoiding
specific
crisis
actions
or
not
understating
its
importance
will
have
extremely
severe
implications
.
all
the
neighboring
countries
of
india
have
reported
positive
covid-19
cases
.
to
protect
against
the
deadly
virus
,
the
indian
government
have
taken
necessary
and
strict
measures
,
including
establishing
health
check
posts
between
the
national
borders
to
test
whether
people
entering
the
country
have
the
virus
(
17
)
.
different
countries
have
introduced
rescue
efforts
and
surveillance
measures
for
citizens
wishing
to
return
from
china
.
the
lesson
learned
from
the
sars
outbreak
was
first
that
the
lack
of
clarity
and
information
about
sars
weakened
china
's
global
standing
and
hampered
its
economic
growth
(
10
,
18–20
)
.
the
outbreak
of
sars
in
china
was
catastrophic
and
has
led
to
changes
in
health
care
and
medical
systems
(
18
,
20
)
.
compared
with
china
,
the
ability
of
india
to
counter
a
pandemic
seems
to
be
much
lower
.
a
recent
study
reported
that
affected
family
members
had
not
visit
the
wuhan
market
in
china
,
suggesting
that
sars-cov-2
may
spread
without
manifesting
symptoms
(
21
)
.
researchers
believe
that
this
phenomenon
is
normal
for
many
viruses
.
india
,
with
a
population
of
more
than
1.34
billion—the
second
largest
population
in
the
world—will
have
difficulty
treating
severe
covid-19
cases
because
the
country
has
only
49,000
ventilators
,
which
is
a
minimal
amount
.
if
the
number
of
covid-19
cases
increases
in
the
nation
,
it
would
be
a
catastrophe
for
india
(
22
)
.
it
would
be
difficult
to
identify
sources
of
infection
and
those
who
come
in
contact
with
them
.
this
would
necessitate
multiple
strategies
to
handle
the
outbreak
,
including
computational
modeling
as
well
as
statistical
and
quantitative
analyses
,
to
rapidly
develop
new
vaccines
and
drug
treatments
.
with
such
a
vast
population
,
india
's
medical
system
is
grossly
inadequate
.
a
study
has
shown
that
,
owing
to
inadequate
medical
care
systems
,
nearly
1
million
people
die
every
year
in
india
(
23
)
.
india
is
also
engaged
in
trading
with
its
nearby
countries
,
such
as
bangladesh
,
bhutan
,
pakistan
,
myanmar
,
china
,
and
nepal
.
during
the
financial
year
2017–18
(
fy2017–18
)
,
indian
regional
trade
amounted
to
nearly
$
12
billion
,
accounting
for
only
1.56
%
of
its
total
global
trade
value
of
$
769
billion
.
the
outbreak
of
such
viruses
and
their
transmission
would
significantly
affect
the
indian
economy
.
the
outbreak
in
china
could
profoundly
affect
the
indian
economy
,
especially
in
the
sectors
of
electronics
,
pharmaceuticals
,
and
logistics
operations
,
as
trade
ports
with
china
are
currently
closed
.
this
was
further
supported
by
the
statement
by
suyash
choudhary
,
head—fixed
income
,
idfc
amc
,
stating
that
gdp
might
decrease
owing
to
covid-19
(
24
)
.economists
assume
that
the
impact
of
covid-19
on
the
economy
will
be
high
and
negative
when
compared
with
the
sars
impact
during
2003
.
for
instance
,
it
has
been
estimated
that
the
number
of
tourists
arriving
in
china
was
much
higher
than
that
of
tourists
who
traveled
during
the
season
when
sars
emerged
in
2003
.
this
shows
that
covid-19
has
an
effect
on
the
tourism
industry
.
it
has
been
estimated
that
,
for
sars
,
there
was
a
57
and
45
%
decline
in
yearly
rail
passenger
and
road
passenger
traffic
,
respectively
(
25
)
.
moreover
,
when
compared
with
the
world
economy
15
years
ago
,
world
economies
are
currently
much
more
inter-related
.
it
has
been
estimated
that
covid-19
will
hurt
emerging
market
currencies
and
also
impact
oil
prices
(
26–28
)
.
from
the
retail
industry
's
perspective
,
consumer
savings
seem
to
be
high
.
this
might
have
an
adverse
effect
on
consumption
rates
,
as
all
supply
chains
are
likely
to
be
affected
,
which
in
turn
would
have
its
impact
on
supply
when
compared
with
the
demand
of
various
necessary
product
items
(
29
)
.
this
clearly
proves
that
,
based
on
the
estimated
losses
due
to
the
effect
of
sars
on
tourism
(
retail
sales
lost
around
usd
12–18
billion
and
usd
30–100
billion
was
lost
at
a
global
macroeconomic
level
)
,
we
can
not
estimate
the
impact
of
covid-19
at
this
point
.
this
will
be
possible
only
when
the
spread
of
covid-19
is
fully
controlled
.
until
that
time
,
any
estimates
will
be
rather
ambiguous
and
imprecise
(
19
)
.
the
oecd
interim
economic
assessment
has
provided
briefing
reports
highlighting
the
role
of
china
in
the
global
supply
chain
and
commodity
markets
.
japan
,
south
korea
,
and
australia
are
the
countries
that
are
most
susceptible
to
adverse
effects
,
as
they
have
close
ties
with
china
.
it
has
been
estimated
that
there
has
been
a
20
%
decline
in
car
sales
,
which
was
10
%
of
the
monthly
decline
in
china
during
january
2020
.
this
shows
that
even
industrial
production
has
been
affected
by
covid-19
.
so
far
,
several
factors
have
thus
been
identified
as
having
a
major
economic
impact
:
labor
mobility
,
lack
of
working
hours
,
interruptions
in
the
global

,
and
less
demand
in
the
commodity
market
at
a
global
level
(
30
)
,
which
in
turn
need
to
be
adequately
analyzed
by
industry
type
.
corporate
leaders
need
to
prioritize
the
supply
chain
and
product
line
economy
trends
via
demand
from
the
consumer
end
.
amidst
several
debates
on
sustainable
economy
before
the
covid-19
impact
,
it
has
now
been
estimated
that
india
's
gdp
by
the
international
monetary
fund
has
been
cut
down
to
1.9
%
from
5.8
%
for
the
fy21
.
the
financial
crisis
that
has
emerged
owing
to
the
worldwide
lockdown
reflects
its
adverse
effect
on
several
industries
and
the
global
supply
chain
,
which
has
resulted
in
the
gdp
dropping
to
4.2
%
for
fy20
,
which
was
previously
estimated
at
4.8
%
.
nevertheless
,
it
has
been
roughly
estimated
that
india
and
china
will
be
experiencing
considerable
positive
growth
among
other
major
economies
(
31
)
.an
easy
way
to
decrease
sars-cov-2
infection
rates
is
to
avoid
virus
exposure
.
people
from
india
should
avoid
traveling
to
countries
highly
affected
with
the
virus
,
practice
proper
hygiene
,
and
avoid
consuming
food
that
is
not
home
cooked
.
necessary
preventive
measures
,
such
as
wearing
a
mask
,
regular
hand
washing
,
and
avoiding
direct
contact
with
infected
persons
,
should
also
be
practiced
.
the
ministry
of
health
and
family
welfare
(
mohfw
)
,
india
,
has
raised
awareness
about
the
recent
outbreak
and
taken
necessary
action
to
control
covid-19
.
besides
,
the
mohfw
has
created
a
24

.india
is
known
for
its
traditional
medicines
in
the
form
of
ayush
(
ayurvedic
,
yoga
and
naturopathy
,
unani
,
siddha
,
and
homeopathy
)
.
the
polyherbal
powder
nilavembukudineer
showed
promising
effects
against
dengue
and
chikungunya
fevers
in
the
past
(
32
)
.
with
the
outbreak
of
covid-19
,
the
ministry
of
ayush
has
released
a
press
note
“
advisory
for
coronavirus
,
”
mentioning
useful
medications
to
improve
the
immunity
of
the
individuals
(
33
)
.
currently
,
according
to
the
icmr
guidelines
,
doctors
prescribe
a
combination
of
lopinavir
and
ritonavir
for
severe
covid-19
cases
and
hydroxychloroquine
for
prophylaxis
of
sars-cov-2
infection
(
34
,
35
)
.
in
collaboration
with
the
who
,
icmr
will
conduct
a
therapeutic
trial
for
covid-19
in
india
(
3
)
.
the
icmr
recommends
using
the
us-fda-approved
closed
real-time
rt-pcr
systems
,
such
as
genexpert
and
roche
cobas-6800/8800
,
which
are
used
to
diagnose
chronic
myeloid
leukemia
and
melanoma
,
respectively
(
36
)
.
in
addition
,
the
truenattm
beta
cov
test
on
the
truelabtm
workstation
validated
by
the
icmr
is
recommended
as
a
screening
test
.
all
positive
results
obtained
on
this
platform
need
to
be
confirmed
by
confirmatory
assays
for
sars-cov-2
.
all
negative
results
do
not
require
further
testing
.
antibody-based
rapid
tests
were
validated
at

,
pune
,
and
found
to
be
satisfactory
;

as
a
step
further
,
on
the
technological
aspect
,
the
union
health
ministry
has
launched
a
mobile
application
called
“
aarogyasetu
”
that
works
both
on
android
and
ios
mobile
phones
.
this
application
constructs
a
user
database
for
establishing
an
awareness
network
that
can
alert
people
and
governments
about
possible
covid-19
victims
(
37
)
.infections
caused
by
these
viruses
are
an
enormous
global
health
threat
.
they
are
a
major
cause
of
death
and
have
adverse
socio-economic
effects
that
are
continually
exacerbated
.
therefore
,
potential
treatment
initiatives
and
approaches
need
to
be
developed
.
first
,
india
is
taking
necessary
preventive
measures
to
reduce
viral
transmission
.
second
,
icmr
and
the
ministry
of
ayush
provided
guidelines
to
use
conventional
preventive
and
treatment
strategies
to
increase
immunity
against
covid-19
(
3
,
38
)
.
these
guidelines
could
help
reduce
the
severity
of
the
viral
infection
in
elderly
patients
and
increase
life
expectancy
(
39
)
.
the
recent
report
from
the
director
of
icmr
mentioned
that
india
would
undergo
randomized
controlled
trials
using
convalescent
plasma
of
completely
recovered
covid-19
patients
.
convalescent
plasma
therapy
is
highly
recommended
,
as
it
has
provided
moderate
success
with
sars
and
mers
(
40
)
;
this
has
been
rolled
out
in
20
health
centers
and
will
be
increased
this
month
(
may
2020
)
(

)
.
india
has
expertise
in
specialized
medical/pharmaceutical
industries
with
production
facilities
,
and
the
government
has
established
fast-tracking
research
to
develop
rapid
diagnostic
test
kits
and
vaccines
at
low
cost
(
41
)
.
in
addition
,
the
serum
institute
of
india
started
developing
a
vaccine
against
sars-cov-2
infection
(
42
)
.
until
we
obtain
an
appropriate
vaccine
,
it
is
highly
recommended
that
we
screen
the
red
zoned
areas
to
stop
further
transmission
of
the
virus
.
medical
college
doctors
in
kerala
,
india
,
implemented
the
low-cost
wisk
(
walk-in
sample
kiosk
)
to
collect
samples
without
direct
exposure
or
contact
(
43
,
44
)
.
after
kerala
,
the
defense
research
and
development
organization
(
drdo
)
developed
walk-in
kiosks
to
collect
covid-19
samples
and
named
these
as
covid-19
sample
collection
kiosk
(
covsack
)
(
45
)
.
after
the
swab
collection
,
the
testing
of
sars-cov-2
can
be
achieved
with
the
existing
diagnostic
facility
in
india
.
this
facility
can
be
used
for
massive
screening
or
at
least
in
the
red
zoned
areas
without
the
need
for
personal
protective
equipment
kits
(
43
,
45
)
.
india
has
attempted
to
broaden
its
research
facilities
and
shift
toward
testing
the
mass
population
,
as
recommended
by
medical
experts
in
india
and

viral

dangerous
resistance
to
the
immunity
generated
by
the
current
vaccines
to
prevent
coronavirus
disease
2019
(
covid-19
)
.
moreover
,
if
some
variants
of
concern
have
increased
transmissibility
or
virulence
,
the
importance
of
efficient
public
health
measures
and
vaccination
programs
will
increase
.
the
global
response
must
be
both
timely
and
science
based.in
addition
to
continuing
to
track
the
emergence
of
new
variants
of
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
2
(
sars-cov-2
)
,
there
are
four
major
priorities
for
the
global
response
to
variants
of
concern
(
table
1
)
.
these
priorities
,
which
involve
scientific
approaches
for
evaluating
existing
vaccines
and
developing
modified
and
new
vaccines
,
are
to
determine
whether
existing
vaccines
are
losing
efficacy
against
variants
,
to
decide
whether
modified
or
new
vaccines
are
warranted
to
restore
efficacy
against
variants
,
to
reduce
the
likelihood
that
variants
of
concern
will
emerge
,
and
to
coordinate
international
research
and
the
response
to
new
variants
,
both
in
general
and
in
relation
to
vaccines
,
through
the
world
health
organization
(
who
)
.efforts
to
track
viral
mutations
and
variants
are
ongoing
.
the
aim
is
to
detect
new
changes
quickly
and
to
assess
their
possible
effects
.
many
research
groups
are
sequencing
virus
isolates
and
sharing
these
sequences
on
public
databases
such
as
gisaid
(
global
initiative
on
sharing
all
influenza
data
)
.1
this
collaboration
helps
scientists
track
the
ways
in
which
the
virus
is
evolving
.
in
order
to
help
monitor
and
respond
to
the
evolving
pandemic
,
it
is
important
that
all
countries
increase
the
collection
of
virus
isolates
for
sequencing
and
sharing
.
a
sars-cov-2
risk-monitoring
and
evaluation
framework
is
being
developed
and
continually
improved
by
the
who
to
identify
and
assess
variants
of
concern
.
this
framework
,
which
involves
enhanced
surveillance
,
research
on
variants
of
interest
and
variants
of
concern
,
and
evaluation
of
the
effect
of
variants
on
diagnostic
tests
,
therapeutic
agents
,
and
vaccines
,
will
assist
in
global
decision
making
regarding
changes
in
vaccines
that
may
be
necessary.variants
of
concern
with
increased
transmissibility
are
contributing
to
the
reversal
of
the
decreases
in
covid-19
case
counts
that
occurred
in
many
countries
earlier
this
year.2
the
b.1.1.7
(
or
alpha
)
variant
of
concern
increases
viral
transmissibility3
and
is
emerging
as
an
increasingly
common
variant
.
the
p.1
(
or
gamma
)
variant
may
cause
severe
disease
even
in
persons
who
have
been
previously
infected
,
although
definitive
information
is
lacking.4
the
b.1.351
(
or
beta
)
variant
is
less
easily
neutralized
by
convalescent
plasma
obtained
from
patients
infected
with
previous
variants
and
by
serum
obtained
from
vaccinees
than
the
prototype
virus
on
which
vaccine
antigens
are
based,5
and
preliminary
evidence
(
based
on
data
from
post
hoc
subgroups
in
placebo-controlled
vaccine
trials
)
suggests
reduced
efficacy
of
some
vaccines
against
mild
or
moderate
disease
caused
by
this
variant.6-8
additional
variants
that
are
responsible
for
many
deaths
,
such
as
b.1.617.2
(
or
delta
)
,9
continue
to
emerge
.
so
far
,
there
is
no
good
evidence
that
currently
identified
variants
of
concern
evade
the
most
important
vaccine
effect
—
that
of
prevention
of
severe
disease
.
table
2
describes
key
properties
of
and
mutations
in
five
selected
variants
.
the
fact
that
a
few
key
amino
acids
in
the
spike
protein
have
changed
independently
in
variants
identified
in
various
parts
of
the
world
indicates
that
these
are
convergent
changes
and
suggests
that
vaccines
that
incorporate
these
selected
residues
could
cover
several
variants.although
animal
models
and
in
vitro
studies
can
provide
important
information
,
clinical
data
will
continue
to
be
needed
to
determine
whether
existing
vaccines
are
losing
efficacy
against
variants
.
while
existing
vaccines
are
being
deployed
,
clinical
data
can
be
sought
not
only
from
carefully
planned
observational
studies
,
but
also
from
randomized
trials
of
vaccines
versus
placebo
,
of
one
vaccine
versus
another
,
or
of
different
vaccination
regimens
(
e.g.
,
different
doses
,
numbers
of
doses
,
and
intervals
between
doses
)
.in
areas
where
the
vaccine
supply
or
delivery
capacity
is
limited
,
instead
of
letting
operational
decisions
determine
the
order
in
which
people
are
vaccinated
,
making
first
vaccine
doses
available
to
some
of
the
target
population
on
a
randomized
basis
could
provide
useful
information
about
efficacy
against
major
variants
.
this
is
especially
true
if
the
numbers
of
participants
who
undergo
randomization
are
large
enough
to
allow
assessment
of
“
hard
”
end
points
such
as
hospitalization
or
severe
disease.if
large-scale
randomization
were
used
during
vaccine
deployment
to
compare
the
effects
of
early
second
doses
with
those
of
delayed
second
doses
,
any
differences
in
efficacy
could
be
reliably
assessed
not
only
overall
but
perhaps
with
respect
to
certain
common
variants
.
in
some
populations
,
random
assignment
of
the
vaccination
date
or
location
might
be
built
into
public
health
programs
,
and
persons
who
become
eligible
for
vaccination
(
according
to
vaccine
priority
groupings
)
could
be
randomly
assigned
to
receive
appointments
to
be
vaccinated
with
a
longer
or

may
help
to
determine
whether

in

where

,
the

still

however
,
the
validity
of
a

as

is
dependent
on
the

and

should
account
for
the

.
studies
in
which
one
vaccine
is
boosted
with
a
later
dose
of
another
would
also
be
valuable.variants
of
concern
have
been
evolving
since
the
beginning
of
the
covid-19
pandemic
,
with
selective
advantage
generally
favoring
more
transmissible
variants
.
variants
of
concern
with
resistance
against
natural
or
vaccine-induced
immunity
would
probably
supplant
previously
circulating
strains
only
if
this
immune
evasion
capability
resulted
in
increased
fitness
,
including
transmissibility
.
given
the
emergence
of
immunity-evading
variants
even
before
vaccines
were
broadly
deployed
,
it
is
hard
to
implicate
vaccines
or
vaccine
deployment
strategies
as
the
major
drivers
of
immune
evasion.however
,
prolonged
viral
replication
in
the
presence
of
partial
immunity
in
immunocompromised
persons
or
circumstances
in
which
rapid
transmission
of
high
titers
of
virus
occurs
(
e.g.
,
crowded
living
conditions23
)
could
have
contributed
to
the
development
of
variants
that
can
at
least
partially
escape
human
immune
responses
.
the
use
of
antibody-based
treatments
(
e.g.
,
monoclonal
antibodies
or
convalescent
plasma
)
in
circumstances
in
which
they
are
of
limited
or
undemonstrated
efficacy
may
further
contribute
to
the
evolution
of
variants
of
concern
that
could
evade
not
only
these
but
also
other
antibody
responses.24
partially
effective
interventions
may
therefore
encourage
viral
evolution
.
in
addition
,
the
larger
the
number
of
infected
persons
,
the
greater
the
chance
that
new
variants
of
concern
will
arise
.
hence
,
effective
public
health
strategies
such
as
social
distancing
,
the
use
of
masks
,
and
the
targeted
use
of
effective

that
reduce
both
infection
and
transmission
can
help
to
limit
viral
evolution
.
limiting
transmission
in
the
general
population
is
extremely
important
for
slowing
the
emergence
of
additional
variants
of
concern.globally
,

being
rolled

currently
,
the
main
strategy
is
to
protect
critical
services
,
persons
in
whom
severe
disease
is
most
likely
to
develop
(
e.g.
,
older
adults
)
,
and
persons
who
are
likely
to
transmit
the

to
vulnerable
populations
(
e.g.

,
and

workers
)
,
and
to
contain
the

of
the

in

.
the
balance
between
using
vaccines
to
protect
persons
from
disease
and
using
vaccines
to
target

involves
a
strategic
decision
that
should
be
informed
by
reliable
epidemiologic
information.in
some
epidemics
,
complete
disease
elimination
has
been
achieved
efficiently
by
using
an
epidemiologic
understanding
of
transmission
to
target
the
deployment
of
vaccines
(
e.g.
,
vaccinating
“
rings
”
of
contacts
and
contacts

contacts
around
cases
of
smallpox
or

)
.

with
other
public
health
measures
,
targeting
vaccination
to
persons
in
certain
areas
or
to
demographic
groups
with
a
high
incidence
of
infection
rather
than
focusing
only
on
persons
at
high
risk
for
serious
disease
could
slow
transmission
and
reduce
the
risk
of
development
of
additional
variants
of
concern
,
although
no
strategy
can
work
if
adequate
vaccine
supplies
are
unavailable
.
targeted
approaches
are
now
being
investigated
.
for
example
,
in
certain
areas
,
the
deployment
of
some
vaccines
in
a
modified
ring
vaccination
strategy
has
been
suggested.29
studies
of
the
effectiveness
of
such
targeted
strategies
could
be
of
global
relevance
,
especially
if
groups
or
areas
with
consistently
high
and
low
rates
of
transmission
can
be
identified.new
variants
of
concern
may
emerge
in
any
corner
of
the
world
and
spread
quickly
,
and
convergent
changes
have
been
noted
in
variants
of
concern
identified
in
various
parts
of
the
world
.
the
modification
of
sequences
targeted
by
a
vaccine
to
meet
the
needs
of
one
country
could
have
repercussions
elsewhere
.
therefore
,
vaccine
development
,
vaccine
modification
,
and

deployment
should
be
viewed
as
international
enterprises
,
with
international
coordination
by

is
essential
in

and
in
facilitating

this

probably
resulted
from

,
the

as
of
7

efficacy
continued
to
increase
through
approximately
8
weeks
after

,
especially
for

.
no

was
noted
among

participants
who
were
followed
for
11
weeks
or
among

participants
who
were
followed

,
a
finding
that
is
consistent
with
the
persistence
of
humoral
immunity
that
was
observed
in
a
phase
1–2a
trial.9efficacy
against
severe–critical
covid-19
was
consistently
high
overall
and
in
individual
countries
that
had
sufficient
cases
for
analysis
,
which
is
particularly
important
because
severe
disease
has
the
greatest
effect
on
individual
persons
and
health
care
systems.19
efficacy
against
covid-19
involving
hospitalization
was
93
%
with
regard
to
onset
at
least
14
days
after
administration
(
2
cases
in
the
vaccine
group
and
29
in
the
placebo
group
)
and
100
%
with
regard
to
onset
at
least
28
days
after
administration
(
no
hospitalizations
in
the
vaccine
group
and
16
in
the
placebo
group
)
.
although
hospitalization
can
be
influenced
by
local
practice
and
resource
availability
,
all
the
hospitalizations
that
were
reported
were
justified
by
clear
clinical
findings
and
were
consistent
across
countries
.
moreover
,
identical
management
practices
would
have
applied
to
the
ad26.cov2.s
group
and
the
placebo
group
in
each
country
.
five
deaths
that
were
related
to
covid-19
occurred
in
the
placebo
group
,
but
there
were
no
such
deaths
in
the
vaccine
group
.
the
reduction
in
the
incidence
of
death
and
the
high
efficacy
against
hospitalization
are
expected
to
substantially
reduce
the
effect
of
this
disease
on
individual
persons
and
dramatically
decrease
the
burden
on
health
care
systems.vaccine
recipients
with
breakthrough
covid-19
reported
fewer
and
less
severe
symptoms
than
did
placebo
recipients
with
covid-19
,
which
suggests
that
illness
is
milder
after
vaccination
.
the
data
are
consistent
with
studies
reporting
higher
efficacy
of
the
influenza
vaccine
against
more
severe
influenza20-22
and
the
attenuation
of
influenza
among
vaccinees.23-25
a
preliminary
analysis
indicated
that
ad26.cov2.s
provided
at
least
66
%
protection
against
serologically
confirmed
asymptomatic
infection
with
sars-cov-2
.
the
effect
on
the
incidence
of
symptomatic
and
asymptomatic
sars-cov-2
infection
by
the
vaccine
suggests
that
it
might
be
useful
in
reducing
community-wide
transmission.new
sars-cov-2
virus
lineages
have
emerged
,
with
mutations
in
the
n-terminal
and
receptor-binding
domains
of
the
spike
protein
that
are
known
targets
for
neutralizing
antibodies
;
in
particular
,
the
e484k
mutation
is
associated
with
reduced
neutralization
sensitivity.26-31
of
main
concern
are
variants
that
were
first
identified
in
brazil
,
south
africa
,
and
the
united
kingdom.2-4
in
our
trial
,
95
%
of
the
covid-19
cases
in
south
africa
in
which
sars-cov-2
was
sequenced
were
caused
by
the
20h/501y.v2
variant
,
whereas
a
variant
from
the
p.2
lineage
carrying
the
e484k
mutation
was
identified
in
69
%
of
the
cases
in
brazil
with
a
sequenced
sample
.
however
,
despite
the
high
prevalence
of
sars-cov-2
variants
of
concern
,
vaccine
efficacy
remained
high
.
this
finding
shows
that
a

vaccine
that
was
based
on
the
original
wuhan-hu-1
strain
can
elicit
cross-protective
efficacy
against
new
variants
in
south
africa
and
brazil
.
nonneutralizing
antibodies
against
sars-cov-2
variants
are
probably
preserved
because
they
are
not
limited
to
the
n-terminal
or
receptor-binding
domains
,
where
most
mutations
occur
.
antibodies
with
fc-mediated
functions
are
induced
by
ad26.cov2.s
against
sars-cov-2
in
humans,32
and
these
fc
functional
antibodies
show
no
decrease
in
potency
against
new
variants

trial.9
t-cell
epitopes
were
shown
to
be
conserved
between
sars-cov-2
variants
according
to
immunoinformatics
analyses.33-35
these
factors
might
contribute
to
the
high
efficacy
against
severe–critical
disease
,
hospitalization
,
and
death
in
south
africa
,
where
the
relatively
neutralization-resistant
20h/501y.v2
variant
predominates.26,36efficacy
against
symptomatic
infection
was
similar
among
younger
and
older
participants
and
among
participants
with
coexisting
conditions
and
those
without
coexisting
conditions
.
a
subgroup
analysis
involving
participants
60
years
of
age
or
older
showed
that
vaccine
efficacy
against
symptomatic
disease
with
onset
at
least
14
days
after
administration
was
similar
in
subgroups
defined
according
to
the
presence
or
absence
of
coexisting
conditions
.
with

to

28
days
after

,
vaccine
efficacy
appeared
lower
among
participants
with
coexisting
conditions
than
among
those

.
this
finding
can
be
attributed
to
imprecision
owing
to
fewer
cases
and
shorter
follow-up
in
this
subgroup
.
furthermore
,
kaplan–meier

indicated
that
the
cumulative

of

key
strength
of
this
trial
is
that
it
showed
vaccine
efficacy
in
an
ethnically
and
geographically
diverse
population
,
including
participants
in
regions
with
emerging
sars-cov-2

as
well
as
in
participants
with
coexisting
conditions
that
have
been
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
severe
covid-19
.
a
limitation
of
the
trial
is
the
relatively
short
follow-up
,
which
was
necessitated
,
as
in
other
covid-19
vaccine
trials
,
by
the
urgent
need
for

.
the

not
suggest
a

of

lower
vaccine

has
been
associated
with
a
higher

of

this
situation
,
combined
with
the
emergence
of

,
precludes
the
comparison
of

.
in

we
robustly
field-tested

attack-rate
conditions
on
three
continents
and
consistently
found
early
and
increasing
protection
from

this
trial
,
we
found
that
a
single
dose
of
ad26.cov2.s
protected
against
symptomatic
covid-19
and
was
particularly
efficacious
against
severe–critical
disease
(
including
hospitalization

)
,
including
in
countries
where

that
are

this
difference
may
reflect
the

which
affected
both

the
controls
equally
during

12
days
after

of

.
to
eliminate
this
distortion
,
we
estimated
first-dose
effectiveness
of
the
vaccine
against
covid-19
for
the
period
from
days
14

;
the

a

was
reported
by
chodick
et

who
evaluated
a
cohort
from
another
health

organization
in

and
used
a

that

at
days
13
through

after
the
first
dose
against

during

0
through
12.in
the
randomized
trial
,
the
estimated
vaccine
efficacy
for
severe
covid-19
(
89
%
over
the
entire
study
period
)
was
based
on
only
10
cases

our

recorded
229
cases
of
severe
covid-19
—
55
in
the

80
%
for

and
92
%
for
7
or
more
days
after
the
second

large
sample
size
in
our
study
also
allowed
us
to
estimate
vaccine
effectiveness
for
specific
subpopulations
that
the
randomized

was
not
sufficiently

to
evaluate
.
in

,
and
65

or
older
7
days

was
94
to
96
%
.
we
were
able
to
study
more
granular
age
groups
,
and
we
estimated
that
the
vaccine
effectiveness
was
similar
for
adults
70
years
of
age
or
older
and
for
younger
age
groups
for
the

estimated

or
more
coexisting
conditions
according
to
the
charlson
comorbidity
index16
and
specifically
for
patients
with
obesity
or
hypertension
.
these
measures
do
not
provide
clarity
regarding
effectiveness
in
patients
with
multiple
coexisting
conditions
.
we
estimated
vaccine
effectiveness
in
relation
to
various
numbers
of
coexisting
conditions
and
found
indications
that
effectiveness
may
be
slightly
lower
among
persons
with
higher

factors
make
the

uniquely

this
study
estimates
an
average
effectiveness
of
the
vaccine
over
multiple
strains
.
although
we
can
not
provide
a
specific
effectiveness
estimate
for
the
b.1.1.7
variant
,
the
plateau
observed
during
the
later
periods
in
the
cumulative
incidence
curve
for
vaccinated
persons
suggests
that
the
bnt162b2
vaccine
is
also
effective
for
this
variant
,
an
observation
consistent
with
previous
reports
that
showed
preserved
neutralizing
antibody
titers.22
the
b.1.351
variant
was
estimated
to
be
rare
in
israel
at
the
time
of
data
extraction.23as
with
any
observational
study
,
our
study
may
have
been
affected
by
residual
confounding
due
to
differences
between
vaccinated
persons
and
unvaccinated
controls
,
especially
in
terms
of
health-seeking
behavior
.
we
therefore
performed
rigorous
matching
on
a
wide
range
of
factors
that
may
be
expected
to
confound
the
causal
effect
of
the
vaccine
on
the
various
outcomes
.
after
the
matching
process
,
we
found
a
consistent
pattern
of
similarity
between
the
groups
in
the
days
just
before
day
12
after
the
first
dose
(
the
anticipated
onset
of
the
vaccine
effect
)
,
which
thus
serve
as
a
“
negative
control
”
24
period
(
figure

,

.

,
and
table
s7
)
.
this
similarity
occurred
despite
a
temporary
increase
in
events
among
unvaccinated
controls
during
the
very
first
days
after
the
first
vaccine
dose
,
most
likely
stemming
from
the
fact
that
persons
who
choose
to
be
vaccinated
on
a
specific
day
are
feeling
well
at
the
time
of
vaccination
.
the
similarity
of
the
study
groups
in
coexisting
conditions
and
known
risk
factors
for
severe
covid-19
(
table
1
and
fig
.
s2
)
provides
further
evidence
of
exchangeability
(
i.e.
,
absence
of
confounding
)
.
however
,
this
rigorous
matching
process
came
at
the
cost
of
not
including
in
the
final
cohort
approximately
34
%
of
the
vaccinated
persons
who
otherwise
met
the
study
’
s
eligibility
criteria
.
limited
matching
on
age
and
sex
only
would
have
been
insufficient
to
eliminate
the
early
confounding
(
fig
.
s6
)
.we
also
excluded
population
groups
with
high
internal
variability
in
the
probability
of
vaccination
or
outcome
,
such
as
health
care
workers
,
persons
confined
to
the
home
for
medical
reasons
,
and
nursing
home
residents
,
to
avoid
residual
confounding
.
although
the
randomized
trial
was
also
less
likely
to
include
persons
who
were
not
healthy
enough
to
comply
with
the
scheduled
visits
and
vaccination
plan
,
it
did
not
exclude
health
care
workers.to
assess
a
possible
selection
bias
that
could
stem
from
informative
censoring
,
whereby
controls
who
are
vaccinated
feel
well
around
the
time
of
vaccination
,
we
performed
a
sensitivity
analysis
in
which
they
were
kept
in
the
unvaccinated
group
for
a
period
of
time
that
was
set
differently
for
each
outcome
(
fig
.
s7
and
table
s5
)
.
this
analysis
showed
results
similar
to
those
of
the
main
analysis
,
which
suggests
that
any
such
bias
was
small
in
our
analysis.finally
,
the
date
of
onset
of
symptoms
was
not
available
for
the
analysis
.
instead
,
for
infection
outcomes
,
the
date
was
set
to
the
date
of
swab
collection
for
the
first
positive
pcr
test
.
given
that
there
was
likely
to
have
been
a
time
gap
between
the
onset
of
symptoms
and
swab
collection
,
the
observed
divergence
of
the
cumulative
incidence
plots
for
the
infection
outcomes
between
the
vaccinated
persons
and
unvaccinated
controls
may
be
slightly
delayed
.
in
parallel
,
there
might
be
an
underestimation
of
the
vaccine
effectiveness
at
each
time
window
,
since
the
estimate
actually
reflects
a
narrower
window
for
the
vaccine
to
be
active
.
because
sars-cov-2
pcr
testing
is
highly
accessible
in
israel
and
can
be
done
without
referral
in
a
matter
of
hours
,
we
estimate
this
potential
time
gap
and
thus
the
vaccine
effectiveness
underestimation
to
be
small
.
in
interpreting
the
effectiveness
estimates
for
more
severe
outcomes
,
longer
median
gaps
should
be
kept
in
mind
(

,
5

estimates
a
high
effectiveness
of
the
bnt162b2
vaccine
for
preventing
symptomatic
covid-19
in
a
noncontrolled
setting
,
similar
to
the
vaccine
efficacy
reported
in
the
randomized

.
our
study
also
suggests
that
effectiveness
is
high
for
the
more
serious
outcomes
:
hospitalization
,
severe
illness
,
and
death
.
furthermore
,
the
estimated
benefit
increases
in

these

these

the

was
1.19
%
among

these
rates
are
higher
than
the
risks
reported
in
the
trials
of
mrna-1273
vaccine1
and
bnt162b2
vaccine.2
possible
explanations
for
this
elevated
risk
include
the
availability
of
regular
testing
for
asymptomatic
and
symptomatic
persons
at
our
institutions
,
a
regional
surge
in
infections
in
southern
california
during
our
vaccination
campaigns,5
and
differences
in
demographic
characteristics
between
the
trial
participants
and
the
health
care
workers
in
our
cohort
.
the
health
care
workers
were
younger
and
had
an
overall
higher
risk
of
exposure
to
sars-cov-2
than
the
participants
in
the
clinical
trials
.
in
addition
,
the
cutoff
dates
for
reporting
in
both
initial
vaccine
trials
were
well
before
this
surge
,
no
testing
of
asymptomatic
persons
was
included
in
the
bnt162b2
vaccine
trial,2
and
only
a
single
screening
of
asymptomatic
persons
was
performed
in
the
mrna-1273
vaccine
trial
before
the
second
dose
was
administered.1the
rarity
of
positive
test
results
14
days
after
administration
of
the
second
dose
of
vaccine
is
encouraging
and
suggests
that
the
efficacy
of
these
vaccines
is
maintained
outside
the
trial
setting
.
these
data
underscore
the
critical
importance
of
continued
public
health
mitigation
measures
(
masking
,
physical
distancing
,
daily
symptom
screening
,
and
regular
testing
)

the
covid-19
pandemic
,
also
known
as
the
coronavirus
pandemic
,
is
an
ongoing
global
pandemic
of
coronavirus
disease
2019
(
covid-19
)
,
which
is
caused
by
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
2
(
sars-cov-2
)
.
the
virus
was
first
identified
in
december
2019
in
wuhan
,
china
.
the
world
health
organization
declared
a
public
health
emergency
of
international
concern
on
30
january
2020
,
and
later
declared
a
pandemic
on
11
march
2020
.
as
of
28
june
2021
,
more
than
181
million
cases
have
been
confirmed
,
with
more
than
3.92
million
confirmed
deaths
attributed
to
covid-19
,
making
it
one
of
the
deadliest
pandemics
in
history
.
the
severity
of
covid-19
symptoms
is
highly
variable
,
ranging
from
unnoticeable
to
life-threatening
.
severe
illness
is
more
likely
in
elderly
covid-19
patients
,
as
well
as
those
who
have
underlying
medical
conditions
.
covid-19
transmits
when
people
breathe
in
air
contaminated
by
droplets
and
small
airborne
particles
.
the
risk
of
breathing
these
in
is
highest
when
people
are
in
close
proximity
,
but
they
can
be
inhaled
over
longer
distances
,
particularly
indoors
.
transmission
can
also
occur
if
splashed
or
sprayed
with
contaminated
fluids
,
in
the
eyes
,
nose
or
mouth
,
and
,
rarely
,
via
contaminated
surfaces
.
people
remain
contagious
for
up
to
20
days
,
and
can
spread
the
virus
even
if
they
do
not
develop
any
symptoms
.

recommended
preventive
measures

several

have
been
developed
and
widely
distributed
in
most
developed
countries
since
december
2020
.
current
treatments
focus
on
addressing
symptoms
,
but
work
is
underway
to
develop
medications
that
inhibit
the
virus
.
authorities
worldwide
have
responded
by
implementing
travel
restrictions
,
lockdowns
and
quarantines
,
workplace
hazard
controls
,
and
business
closures
.
numerous
jurisdictions
have
also
worked
to
increase
testing
capacity
and
trace
contacts
of
the
infected

the
pandemic
has
resulted
in
severe
global
,
social
and
economic
disruption
,
including
the
largest
global
recession
since
the
great
depression
of
the
1930s
.
[

it
has
led
to
widespread
supply
shortages
exacerbated
by
panic

,
agricultural
disruption
,
and

shortages
.
however
,
there
have
also
been
decreased
emissions
of
pollutants
and
greenhouse
gases
.
numerous
educational
institutions
and
public
areas
have
been
partially
or
fully
closed
,
and
many
events
have
been
cancelled
or
postponed
.
misinformation
has
circulated
through
social
media
and
mass
media
,
and
political
tensions
have
been
exacerbated
.
the
pandemic
has
raised
issues
of
racial
and
geographic
discrimination
,
health
equity
,
wealth
inequality
and
the
balance
between
public
health
imperatives
and
individual
rights
.
although
the
exact
origin
of
the
virus
is
still
unknown
,
[

the
first
outbreak
started
in
wuhan
,
hubei
,
china
in
late
2019
.
many
early
cases
of
covid-19
were
linked
to

visited
the
huanan
seafood
wholesale
market
in
wuhan
,
[

several

some

[

it
was
not
clear
whether
this
was
because
young
people
were
less
likely
to
be
infected
,
or
less
likely
to
develop
serious
symptoms
and
seek
medical
attention
and
be
tested
.
[

a

cohort
study

initial
estimates

for
covid-19
in

were
between

2.5
,
[

a

may
be
about
5.7
(
with
a
95

confidence
interval

.
[

r0
can
vary
across
populations
and
is
not
to
be
confused
with
the
effective
reproduction
number
(
commonly
just

,
which
takes
into

by

reflected

more
dangerous
than

this

can
be
misleading
because
of
the

speed

key
to

[

for

to
be

chains

must
be
broken

strategies
in
the
control
of
an
outbreak
are
screening
,
containment
(
or
suppression
)
,
and
mitigation
.
screening
is
done
with
a
device
such
as
a
thermometer
to
detect
the
elevated
body
temperature
associated
with
fevers
caused
by
the
infection
.
[
191
]
containment
is
undertaken
in
the
early
stages
of
the
outbreak
and
aims
to
trace
and
isolate
those
infected
as
well
as
introduce
other
measures
to
stop
the
disease
from
spreading
.
when
it
is
no
longer
possible
to
contain
the
disease
,
efforts
then
move
to
the
mitigation
stage
:
measures
are
taken
to
slow
the
spread
and
mitigate
its
effects
on
the
healthcare
system
and
society
.
a
combination
of
both
containment
and
mitigation
measures
may
be
undertaken
at
the
same
time
.
[
192

suppression
requires
more
extreme
measures
so
as
to
reverse
the
pandemic
by
reducing
the
basic
reproduction
number
to
less
than
1

[

part
of
managing
an
infectious
disease
outbreak
is
trying
to
delay
and
decrease
the
epidemic
peak
,
known
as
flattening
the
epidemic
curve
.
[
188
]
this
decreases
the
risk
of
health
services
being
overwhelmed
and
provides
more
time
for
vaccines
and
treatments
to
be
developed
.
[

non-pharmaceutical
interventions
that
may
manage
the
outbreak
include
personal
preventive
measures
such
as
hand
hygiene
,
wearing
face
masks
,
and
self-quarantine
;
community
measures
aimed
at
physical
distancing
such
as
closing
schools
and
cancelling
mass
gathering
events
;
community
engagement
to
encourage
acceptance
and
participation
in
such
interventions
;
as
well
as
environmental
measures
such
surface
cleaning

[

some
measures
,
particularly
those
that
focus
on
cleaning
surfaces
rather
than
preventing
airborne
transmission
,
have
been
criticised
as

more
drastic
actions
aimed
at
containing
the
outbreak
were
taken
in
china
once
the
severity
of

covid-19
can
affect
the
upper
respiratory
tract
(
sinuses
,
nose
,
and
throat
)
and
the
lower
respiratory
tract
(
windpipe
and
lungs
)
.
[
81
]
the
lungs
are
the
organs
most
affected
by
covid-19
because
the
virus
accesses
host
cells
via
the
receptor
for
the
enzyme
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
2
(
ace2
)
,
which
is
most
abundant
on
the
surface
of
type
ii
alveolar
cells
of
the
lungs

[

the
virus
uses
a
special
surface
glycoprotein

a
``
spike
''
(
peplomer
)
to
connect
to
the
ace2
receptor
and
enter

whether
sars-cov-2
is
able
to
invade
the

results
from

neurons
.
[
85

sars-cov-2
could
cause
respiratory
failure
through
affecting
the
brain
stem
as
other
coronaviruses
have
been
found
to
invade
the
cns
.
while
virus
has
been
detected
in
cerebrospinal
fluid
of
autopsies
,
the
exact
mechanism
by
which
it
invades
the
cns
remains
unclear
and
may
first
involve
invasion
of
peripheral
nerves
given
the
low
levels
of
ace2
in
the
brain
.
[
86
]
[
87
]
[
88
]
the
virus
may
also
enter
the
bloodstream
from
the
lungs
and
cross
the
blood-brain
barrier
to
gain
access
to
the
cns
,
possibly
within
an
infected
white
blood
cell
.
[
84
]
the
virus
also
affects
gastrointestinal
organs
as
ace2
is
abundantly
expressed
in
the
glandular
cells
of
gastric
,
duodenal
and
rectal
epithelium
[

as
well
as
endothelial
cells
and
enterocytes
of
the
small
intestine

[

the
virus
can
cause
acute
myocardial
injury
and
chronic
damage
to
the
cardiovascular
system

an
acute
cardiac
injury

found
in
12
%
of

and
is
more
frequent
in

[

rates
of
cardiovascular
symptoms
are
high
,
owing
to
the
systemic
inflammatory
response
and
immune
system
disorders
during
disease
progression
,
but
acute
myocardial
injuries
may
also
be
related
to
ace2
receptors
in
the
heart
.
[

ace2
receptors
are
highly
expressed
in
the
heart
and
are
involved

a
chain
of
vasoconstrictive

constriction
of

circulation
has
also
been
posited
as

to

via
the
ace2

it
includes
two
subunits
:

s1
determines

domain

s2
mediates
the

[

several
measures
are
commonly
used
to
quantify
mortality
.
[

these
numbers
vary
by
region

over
time
and
are
influenced
by
the
volume

,

,
and
population

[

the
mortality
rate
reflects
the
number
of
deaths
within
a
specific
demographic
group
divided
by
the
population
of
that
demographic
group
.
consequently
,
the
mortality
rate
reflects
the
prevalence
as
well
as
the
severity
of
the
disease
within
a
given
population
.
mortality
rates
are
highly
correlated
to
age

with
relatively
low

[

[

[

in
fact
,
one
relevant
factor
of
mortality
rates
is
the
age
structure
of
the
countries
’
populations
.
for
example
,
the
case
fatality
rate
for
covid-19
is
lower
in
india
than

[

the
case
fatality

(
cfr
)
reflects
the
number
of
deaths
divided
by
the
number
of
diagnosed
cases
within
a
given
time
interval
.
based
on
johns
hopkins
university
statistics
,
the
global
death-to-case
ratio
is
2.2
%
(
3,925,009/181,179,712
)
as
of
28
june

.
[

]
the
number
varies
by
region
.
[
285
]
[
286
]
the
cfr
may
not
reflect
the
true
severity
of
the
disease
,
because
some
infected
individuals
remain
asymptomatic
or
experience
only
mild
symptoms
,
and
hence
such
infections
may
not
be
included
in
official
case
reports
.
moreover
,
the
cfr
may
vary
markedly
over
time
and
across
locations
due
to
the

of

in

the

this

is
calculated
by
dividing
the

by
the
total
number
of

individuals
;
hence
,
in
contrast
to
the

,
the
ifr
incorporates
asymptomatic

infections
as
well
as
reported
cases
.
[

a

that
study
also
found
that
most
of
these
differences
in

reflected
corresponding
differences
in
the
age
composition

the
population

age-specific
infection
rates
;
in
particular
,
the

0.002

develop
an

against

highly
contagious
disease
caused

our

spike
(
s

protein
,
nucleocapsid
(
n

protein
,

membrane
protein
,
have
been
tested
for

we
further
used
the
vaxign
reverse
vaccinology
tool
and
the
newly
developed
vaxign-ml
machine
learning
tool
to
predict
covid-19
vaccine
candidates
.
the
n
protein
was
found
to
be
conserved
in
the
more
pathogenic
strains
(
sars/mers/covid-19
)
,
but
not
in
the
other
human
coronaviruses
that
mostly
cause
mild
symptoms
.
by
investigating
the
entire
proteome
of
sars-cov-2
,
six
proteins
,
including
the
s
protein
and
five
non-structural
proteins
(
nsp3
,
3cl-pro
,
and
nsp8–10
)
were
predicted
to
be
adhesins
,
which
are
crucial
to
the
viral
adhering
and
host
invasion
.
the
s
,
nsp3
,
and
nsp8
proteins
were
also
predicted
by
vaxign-ml
to
induce
high
protective
antigenicity
.
besides
the
commonly
used
s
protein
,
the
nsp3
protein
has
not
been
tested
in
any
coronavirus
vaccine
studies
and
was
selected
for
further
investigation
.
the
nsp3
was
found
to
be
more
conserved
among
sars-cov-2
,
sars-cov
,
and
mers-cov
than
among
15
coronaviruses
infecting
human
and
other
animals
.
the
protein
was
also
predicted
to
contain
promiscuous
mhc-i
and
mhc-ii
t-cell
epitopes
,
and
linear
b-cell
epitopes
localized
in
specific
locations

as
the
most
superficial
and
protrusive
protein
of
the
coronaviruses
,
s
protein
plays
a
crucial
role
in
mediating
virus
entry
.
in
the
sars
vaccine
development
,
the
full-length
s
protein
and
its
s1
subunit
(
which
contains
receptor
binding
domain
)
have
been
frequently
used
as
the
vaccine
antigens
due
to
their
ability
to
induce
neutralizing
antibodies
that
prevent
host
cell
entry
and
infection
.
however
,
studies
showed
that
s
protein-based
vaccination
did
not
provide
full
protection
and
sometimes
raise
safety
concerns7,8

are
also

recent
years
,
the
development
of
vaccine
design
has
been
revolutionized
by
the
reverse
vaccinology
(
rv
)
,
which
aims
to
first
identify
promising
vaccine
candidate
through
bioinformatics
analysis
of
the
pathogen
genome
.
rv
has
been
successfully
applied
to
vaccine
discovery
for
pathogens
such
as
group
b
meningococcus
and
led
to
the

.
among
current
rv
prediction
tools10,11
,
vaxign
is
the
first
web-based
rv
program12
and
has
been
used
to
successfully
predict
vaccine
candidates
against
different
bacterial
and
viral
pathogens13–15
.
recently
we
have
also
developed
a
machine
learning
approach
called
vaxign-ml
to
enhance
prediction
accuracy16.in
this
study
,
we
first
surveyed
the
existing
coronavirus
vaccine
development
status
,
and
then
applied
the
vaxign
rv
and
vaxign-ml
approaches
to
predict
covid-19
protein
candidates
for
vaccine
development
.
we
identified
six
possible
adhesins
,
including
the
structural
s
protein
and
five
other
non-structural
proteins
,
and
three
of
them
(
s
,
nsp3
,
and
nsp8
proteins
)
were
predicted
to
induce
high
protective
immunity
.
the
s
protein
was
predicted
to
have
the
highest
protective
antigenicity
score
and
it
has
been
extensively
studied
as
the
target
of
coronavirus
vaccines
by
other
researchers
.
here
we
selected
nsp3
protein
as
an
alternative
vaccine
candidate
,
which
was
predicted
to
have
the
second-highest
protective
antigenicity
score
yet
,
has
not
been
considered
in
any
vaccine
studies
.
we
investigated
the
sequence
conservation
and
immunogenicity
of
the
multi-domain
nsp3
protein
as
a
vaccine
candidate.to
better
understand
the
current
status
of
coronavirus
vaccine
development
,
we
systematically
surveyed
the
development
of
vaccines
for
coronavirus
from
the
clinicaltrials.gov
database
and
pubmed
literature
(
as
of
march
17
,
2020
)
.
extensive
effort
has
been
made
to
develop
a
safe
and
effective
vaccine
against
sars
or
mers
,
and
the
most
advance
clinical
trial
study
is
currently
at
phase
ii
(
table

)
.
it
is
a
challenging
task
to
quickly
develop
a
safe
and
effective
vaccine
for
the
on-going
covid-19
pandemic.there
are
two
primary
design
strategies
for
coronavirus
vaccine
development
:
the
usage
of
the
whole
virus
or
genetically
engineered
vaccine
antigens
that
can
be
delivered
through
different
formats
.
the
whole
virus
vaccines
include
inactivated17
or
live
attenuated
vaccines18,19
(
table
2
)
.
the
two
live
attenuated
sars
vaccines
mutated
the
exoribonuclease
and
envelop
protein
to
reduce
the
virulence
and/or
replication
capability
of
the
sars-cov
.
overall
,
the
whole
virus
vaccines
can
induce
a
strong
immune
response
and
protect
against
coronavirus
infections
.
genetically
engineered
vaccines
that
target
specific
coronavirus
protein
are
often
used
to
improve
vaccine
safety
and
efficacy
.
the
coronavirus
antigens
such
as
s
protein
,
n
protein
,
and
m
protein
can
be
delivered
as
recombinant
dna

first
used
the

to
compare
the
full

of
seven
human

strains
(
sars-cov-2
,
sars-cov
,
mers-cov
,
hcov-229e
,
hcov-oc43
,
hcov-nl63
,
and
hcov-hku1
)
.
the
proteins
of
sars-cov-2
were
used
as
the
seed
for
the
pan-genomic
comparative
analysis
.
the
vaxign
pan-genomic
analysis
reported
only
the
n

in
sars-cov-2
having
high
sequence
similarity
among
the
more
severe
form
of

(

)
,

among
the
more
typically
mild
hcov-229e
,
hcov-oc43
,
hcov-nl63
,
and
hcov-hku1
.
the
sequence
conservation
suggested
the
potential
of
n
protein
as
a
candidate
for
the
cross-protective
vaccine
against
sars
and
mers
.
the
n
protein
was
also
evaluated
and
used
for
vaccine
development
(
table
2
)
.
the
n
protein
packs
the
coronavirus
rna
to
form
the
helical
nucleocapsid
in
virion
assembly
.
this
protein
is
more
conserved
than
the
s
protein
and
was
reported
to
induce
an
immune
response
and
neutralize
coronavirus
infections20
.
however
,
a
study
also
showed
the
linkage
between
n
protein
and
severe
pneumonia
or
other
serious
liver
failures
related
to
the
pathogenesis
of
sars21.the
vaxign
rv
analysis
predicted
six
sars-cov-2
proteins
(
s
protein
,
nsp3
,
3cl-pro
,
and
nsp8–10
)
as
adhesive
proteins
(
table
3
)
.
adhesin
plays
a
critical
role
in
the
virus
adhering
to
the
host
cell
and
facilitating
the
virus
entry
to
the
host
cell22
,
which
has
a
significant
association
with
the
vaccine-induced
protection23
.
in
sars-cov-2
,
s
protein
was
predicted
to
be
adhesin
,
matching
its
primary
role
in
virus
entry
.
the
structure
of
sars-cov-2
s
protein
was
determined24
and
reported
to
contribute
to
the
host
cell
entry
by
interacting
with
the
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
2
(
ace2
)
25
.
besides
s
protein
,
the
other
five
predicted
adhesive
proteins
were
all
nonstructural
proteins
.
in

,
nsp3

vaxign-ml
pipeline
computed
the
protegenicity
(
protective

)
score
and
predicted
the
induction
of
protective
immunity
by
a
vaccine
candidate16
.
the
training
data
consisted
of
viral
protective
antigens
,
which
were
tested
to
be
protective
in
at
least
one
animal
challenge
model27
.
the
performance
of
the
vaxign-ml
models
was
evaluated
(
table
s1
and
figure
s1
)
,
and
the
best
performing
model
had
a
weighted
f1-score
of
0.94
.
using
the
optimized
vaxign-ml
model
,
we
predicted
three
proteins
(
s
protein
,
nsp3
,
and
nsp8
)
as
vaccine
candidates
with
significant
protegenicity
scores
(
table
3
)
.
the
s
protein
was
predicted
to
have
the
highest
protegenicity
score
,
which
is
consistent
with
the
experimental
observations
reported
in
the
literature
.
the
nsp3
protein
is
the
second
most
promising
vaccine
candidate
besides
s
protein
.
there
was
currently
no
study
of
nsp3
as
a
vaccine
target
.
the
structure
and
functions
of
this
protein
have
various
roles
in
coronavirus
infection
,
including
replication
and
pathogenesis
(
immune
evasion
and
virus
survival
)
26
.
therefore
,
we
selected
nsp3
for
further
investigation
,
as
described
below.the
multiple
sequence
alignment
and
the
resulting
phylogeny
of
nsp3
protein
showed
that
this
protein
in
sars-cov-2
was
more
closely
related
to
the
human
coronaviruses
sars-cov
and
mers-cov
,
and
bat
coronaviruses
btcov/hku3
,

we
studied

to
cell
invasion
.
for
example
,
despite
markedly
weak
pathogenicity
,
hcov-nl63
also
uses
s
protein
and
employs
the
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
2
(
ace2
)
for
cellular
entry33
.
this
suggests
that
the
s
protein
is
not
the
only
factor
determining
the
infection
level
of
a
human
coronavirus
.
in
addition
,
targeting
only
the
s
protein
may
induce
high
serum-neutralizing
antibody
titers
but
can
not
induce
sufficient
protective
efficacy34
.
thus
,
alternative
vaccine
antigens
may
be
considered.the
sars-cov-2
nsp3
protein
was
predicted
to
be
a
potential
vaccine
candidate
,
as
shown
by
its
predicted
second-highest
protective
antigenicity
score
,
adhesin
property
,
promiscuous
mhc-i
&
mhc-ii
t
cell
epitopes
,
and
b
cell
epitopes
.
the
nsp3
is
the
largest
non-structural
protein
that
includes
multiple
functional
domains
to
support
viral
pathogenesis26
.
the
multiple
sequence
alignment
of
nsp3
also
showed
higher
sequence
conservation
in
most
of
the
functional
domains
in
sars-cov-2
,
sars-cov
,
and
mers-cov
,
than
in
all
15
coronavirus
strains
(
fig
.
1b
)
.
the
induction
of
nsp3-specific
immunity
would
likely
help
the
host
to
fight
against
the
infection
.
besides
the
s
and
nsp3
proteins
,
our
study
also
suggested
four
additional
vaccine
candidates
,
including
3cl-pro
,
nsp8
,
nsp9
,
and
nsp10
.
all
these
proteins
were
predicted
as
adhesins
,
and
the
nsp8
protein
was
also
predicted
to
have
a
significant
protective
antigenicity
score.our
predicted
non-structural
proteins
(
nasp3
,
3cl-pro
,
nsp8
,
nsp9
,
and
nsp10
)
are
not
part
of
the
viral
structural
particle
,
and
none
of
the
non-structural
proteins
have
been
evaluated
as
vaccine
candidates
.
the
sars/mers/covid-19
vaccine
studies
so
far
target
the
structural
(
s/m/n
)
proteins
.
still
,
the
non-structural
proteins
have
been
used
effective
vaccine
antigens
to
stimulate
protective
immunity
against
many
viruses
.
for
example
,
the
non-structural
protein
ns1
was
found
to
induce
protective
immunity
against
the
infections
by
flaviviruses35
.
the
non-structural
proteins
of
the
hepatitis
c
virus
were
reported
to
induce
hcv-specific
vigorous
and
broad-spectrum
t-cell
responses36
.
the
non-structural
hiv-1
gene
products
were
also
shown
to
be
valuable
targets
for
prophylactic
or
therapeutic
vaccines37
.
therefore
,
it
is
reasonable
to
consider
the
sars-cov-2
non-structural
proteins
as
possible
vaccine
targets
,
as
suggested
by
the
present
study.instead
of
using
a
single
protein
as
the
vaccine
antigen
,
we
would
like
to
propose
the
development
of
a
“
cocktail
vaccine
”
as
an
effective
strategy
for
covid-19
vaccine
development
.
a
typical
cocktail
vaccine
includes
more
than
one
antigen
to
cover
different
aspects
of
protection39,40
.
the
licensed
group
b
meningococcus
bexsero
vaccine
,
which
was
developed
via
reverse
vaccinology
,
contains
three
protein
antigens9
.
to
develop
an
efficient
and
safe
covid-19
cocktail
vaccine
,
it
is
possible
to
mix
the
structural
(
e.g.
,
s
protein
)
and
non-structural
(
e.g.
,
nsp3
)
viral
proteins
.
the
other
proteins
identified
in
our
study
may
also
be
considered
as
possible
vaccine
targets
.
the
benefit
of
a
cocktail
vaccine
strategy
could
induce
immunity
that
can
protect
the
host
against
not
only
the
s-ace2
interaction
and
viral
entry
to
the
host
cells
,
but
also
protect
against
the
accessary
non-structural
adhesin
proteins
(
e.g.
,
nsp3
)
,
which
might
also
be
vital
to
the
viral
entry
and
replication
.
the
usage
of
more
than
one
antigen
allows
us
to
reduce
the
volume
of
each
antigen
and
thus
reducing
the
induction
of
adverse
events
.
nonetheless
,
the
potentials
of
these
predicted
non-structural
protein
targets
in
vaccine
development
need
to
be
experimentally
validated.for
rational
covid-19
vaccine
development
,
it
is
critical
to
understand
the
fundamental
host-coronavirus
interaction
and
protective
immune
mechanism7
.
such
understanding
may
not
only
provide
us
guidance
in
terms
of
antigen
selection
but
also
facilitate
our
design
of
vaccine
formulations
.
for
example
,
an
important
foundation
of
our
prediction
in
this
study
is
based
on
our
understanding
of
the
critical
role
of
adhesin
as
a
virulence
factor
as
well
as
protective
antigen
.
the
choice
of
dna
vaccine
,
recombinant
vaccine
vector
,
and
another
method
of
vaccine
formulation
is
also
deeply
rooted
in
our
understanding
of
pathogen-specific
immune
response
induction
.
different
experimental
conditions
may
also
affect
results41,42
.
therefore
,
it
is
crucial
to
understand
the
underlying
molecular
and
cellular
mechanisms
for
rational
vaccine
development.we
annotated
peer-reviewed
journal
articles
stored
in
the
pubmed
database

the

.
from
the

we
identified
and
annotated
those
coronavirus
vaccine
candidates
that
were
experimentally
studied
and
found
to
induce
protective

antibody

provided

advances
in
conventional
vaccines
such
as
these
have
also
come
from
research

says
beate
kampmann

the

doesn

t
mutate
a
lot

have
effective
strategies
for
foiling
the
human
immune
system
,
she
says
,
unlike
hiv
,
herpes
or
even
influenza
.
the
herpes
virus
,
by
contrast
,
has
more
evasion
capability
—
it
actively
blocks
antibodies
from
binding
,
which
makes
it
harder
to
find
an
effective
agent
against
it
.
and
the
fast
mutation
of
flu
viruses
requires
a
different
vaccine
formulation
for
every
flu
season.the
slowest
part
of
vaccine
development
isn
’
t
finding
candidate
treatments
,
but
testing
them
.
this
often
takes
years
(
see
‘
vaccine
innovation
’
)
,
with
companies
running
efficacy
and
safety
tests
on
animals
and
then
in
humans
.
human
testing
requires
three
phases
that
involve
increasing
numbers
of
people
and
proportionately
escalating
costs
.
the
covid-19
vaccines
went
through
the
same
trials
,
but
the
billions
poured
into
the
process
made
it
possible
for
companies
to
take
financial
risks
by
running
some
tests
at
the
same
time

saw

the

it

that

need

it
’

hard
to
run

when

themselves
aren

prevalent
—
especially
,
says
dean
,
in
cases
such
as
mers
,
for
which
outbreaks
of
disease
were
patchy
,
with
peaks
in
some
areas
and
low
infection
rates
in
others.the
covid-19
experience
might
also
prompt
a
regulatory
rethink
.
although
there
has
been
no
relaxing
of
the
stringent
criteria
for
vaccine
approval
,
the
first
candidates
are
mostly
being
approved
under
emergency-use
regulations
.
these
are
faster
but
require
companies
to
conduct
follow-up
surveys
to
look
for
side
effects
and
continuing
efficacy
.
national
regulators
also
swapped
information
on
covid-19

trials
under
the
auspices
of
a
global
body
called

it
has
aimed
to
reach
consensus
on
issues

and
how
to

.the
covid-19
pandemic
should
see
some
permanent
changes
in
vaccine
development
.
for
a
start
,
it
might
establish
the

be
chemically
synthesized

,
in

to
the
more

”
companies
should
also
be

”
still
,
other
vaccines
can
probably
only
be
developed
at
a
comparable
speed
when

levels
are
high
—
making
it

why

rather
than
waiting

are
being
approved
for
emergency
use
.
existing
data
suggest
that
new
vaccine
candidates
may
be
instrumental
in
protecting
individuals
and
reducing
the
spread
of
pandemic
.
the
conceptual
and
technological
platforms
exploited
are
diverse
,
and
it
is
likely
that
different
vaccines
will
show
to
be
better
suited
to
distinct
groups
of
the
human
population
.
moreover
,
it
remains
to
be
elucidated
whether
and
to
what
extent
the
capacity
of
vaccines
under
evaluation
and
of
unrelated
vaccines
such
as
bcg
can
increase
immunological
fitness
by
training
innate
immunity
to
sars-cov-2
and
pathogen-agnostic
protection
.
due
to
the
short
development
time
and
the
novelty
of
the
technologies
adopted
,
these
vaccines
will
be
deployed
with
several
unresolved
issues
that
only
the
passage
of
time
will
permit
to
clarify
.
technical
problems
connected
with
the
production
of
billions
of
doses
and
ethical
ones
connected
with
the
availably
of
these
vaccines
also
in
the
poorest
countries
,
are
imminent
challenges
facing
us
.
it
is
our
tenet
that
in
the
long
run
more
than
one
vaccine
will
be
needed
to
ensure
equitable
global
access
,
protection
of
diverse
subjects
and
immunity
against
viral
variants.the
covid-19
outbreak
has
prompted
scientists
from
around
the
world
to
design
anti-sars-cov-2
vaccines.the
free
availability
of
basic
science
data
has
allowed
creating
vaccines
based
on
very
innovative
platforms
and
directed
towards
very
well
defined
sensible
targets.high
financial
support
both
from
private
consortia
and
the
governments
of
several
nations
have
made
it
possible
to
develop
the
new
vaccines
extremely
quickly.the
possibility
of
having
numerous
vaccines
based
on
different
technologies
will
allow
us
to
select
those
that
can
be
most
effective
in
specific
phases
of
the
pandemic
and
different
parts
of
the
world.the
production
and
distribution
of
billions
of
doses
of
covid-19
vaccines
is
the
new
,
difficult
challenge.the
creative
and
technological
effort
that
lead
to
the
development
of
covid-19
vaccines
has
changed
the
way
of
thinking
and
designing
new
vaccines
for
other
diseases.will
the
new
vaccines
be
able
to
control
the
covid-19
pandemic
?
will
there
be
vaccines
that
will
be
able
to
protect
the
most
fragile
sections
of
the
human
population
?
the
development
of
vaccines
in
a
very
short
time
necessarily
implies
that
is
not
yet
possible
to
know
their
long-term
efficacy
and
possible
side
effects.will
it
be
possible
to
overcome
financial
and
political
problems
and
allow
covid-19
vaccines
to
be
available
with
equity
for
the
entire
population
of
the
world
?
the
hope
and
hype
that
the
media
and
public
at
large
are
placing
on
having
as
soon
as
possible
a
vaccine
that
protects
against
covid-19
is
the
result
of
the
great
triumphs
that
vaccines
have
had
and
are
having
in
the
control
of
infectious
diseases
.
however
,
there
is
a
long
series
of
infectious
diseases
in
which
vaccines
are
only
partially
effective
and
we
have
a
series
of
sensational
vaccine
defeats
[
1
]
.
indeed
,
each
disease
is
an
immunological
problem
in
itself
:
even
today
,
with
all
the
data
at
one
’
s
disposal
,
it
is
difficult
to
predict
what
kind
of
vaccine
can
be
truly
effective
.
this
difficulty
is
even
greater
for
covid-19
,
a
new
disease
in
which
ongoing
studies
in
laboratories
worldwide
are
adding
new
data
at
a
tremendous
pace
.
sars-cov2
,
the
coronavirus
responsible
for
covid-19
is
an
rna
virus
,
and
these
viruses
generally
have
a
high
mutation
rate
.
genetic
instability
has
long
been
considered
to
represent
a
challenge
to
develop
effective
vaccines
against
rna
viruses.in
many
cases
,
recovery
from
a
viral
disease
rests
on
the
combined
action
of
antibodies
in
the
biological
fluids
that
neutralize
the
viral
particles
and
the
killer
activity
of
lymphocytes
that
track
down
and
kill
virus-infected
cells
.
however
,
there
are
viral
diseases
whose
healing
depends
mainly
,
if
not
exclusively
,
on
the
antibody
response
and
others
where
the
destructive
action
of
the
killer
lymphocytes
is
fundamental
.
what
is
the
case
with
covid-19
is
not
yet
clearly
defined
although
several
data
suggest
that
the
major
protective
effect
is
to
be
attributed
to
antibodies
against
the
spike
protein
and
in
particular
against
its
receptor-binding
domain
.
often
,
healed
patients
display
high
titers
of
sars-cov-2
neutralizing
antibodies
[
2
]
.
data
on
the
role
of
mucosal
immunity
and
secretory
iga
and
igm
are
scarce
.
furthermore
,
we
can
not
yet
know
how
long
the
protection
acquired
by
recovered
patients
will
last
.
this
point
is
of
interest
since
often
,
the
duration
of
the
protection
after
healing
somewhat
corresponds
to
the
duration
of
the
protection
provided
by
the
vaccine.despite
the
impressive
amount
of
studies
carried
out
since
the
virus
was
first
characterized
,
there
are
still
a
large
number
of
unknowns
about
this
disease
.
and
it
is
precisely
these
unknowns
that
fully
justify
the
very
different
conceptual
and
technological
strategies
that
are
currently
pursued
in
the
preparation
of
vaccines
against
covid-19
.
this
diversification
appeared
essential
precisely
because
,
for
many
diseases
,
but
particularly
for
a
new
disease
as
covd-19
,
it
is
difficult
to
predict
which
type
of
immune
response
and
therefore
vaccine
will
be
more
effective.as
shown
by
lurie
et
al
.
[
3
]
,
there
are
major
differences
between
traditional
vaccine
development
and
development
under
the
pressure
of
a
rampant
epidemic
.
because
of
the
pressure
created
by
the
pandemic
,
multiple
activities
are
carried
at
financial
risks
,
without
knowing
whether
the
candidate
vaccine
will
be
safe
and
effective
,
including
very
early
manufacturing
and
scale-up
to
commercial
scale
before
the
establishment
of
clinical
proof
of
concept
.
however
,
in
many
cases
,
the
financial
risk
is
mainly
being
taken
by
public
institutions
and
governments
which
provide
financial
support
to
companies
in
their
development
effort.as
of
december
2020
,
just
eleven
months
after
the
definition
of
the
sars-cov-2
genome
,
there
are
over
150
official
vaccine
projects
[
4
,
5
]
.
about
fifty
of
them
have
already
reached
human
experimentation
and
a
few
of
these
are
currently
administered
to
some
sectors
of
the
general
population
.
by
exploiting
different
technologies
,
these
anti-sars-cov-2
candidate
vaccines
are
targeting
the
whole
sars-cov-2
,
molecules
or
fragments
of
molecules
expressed
on
this
virus
surface
.
these
different
candidate
vaccines
can
be
grouped
based
on
the
technological
platform
exploited
to
elicit
a
protective
immune
response
.
however
,
almost
every
vaccine
project
has
its
peculiarities
that
make
it
unique
and
which
could
have
significant
consequences
regarding
the
efficacy
or
duration
of
the
induced
protection
or
the
safety
of
the
vaccine
.

vaccines
based
on
the
whole
inactivated
sars-cov-2.faced
with
this
variety
of
projects
and
the
determination
and
speed
with
which
they
are
carried
out
,
one
can
not
help
but
be
amazed
by
human
scientific
creativity
.
even
if
these
various
projects
compete
with
each
other
and
have
their
technical
secrets
,
their
formulation
comes
from
basic
scientific
research
that
is
structured
as
open
cooperation
between
all
laboratories
in
the
world
.
indeed
,
the
numerous
freely
available
basic
research
data
on
the
mechanisms
of
sars-cov-2
infection
have
convinced
most
developers
of
innovative
vaccine
to
focus
their
efforts
on
inducing
an
immune
response
against
the
spike
protein
(
fig
.
2
)
.
the
new
data
emerging
from
phase
iii
studies
show
that
vaccines
based
on
nucleic
acids
coding
for
the
spike
protein
,
carried
by
liposomes
or
adenoviruses
,
can
elicit
an
effective
protective
response
[
6,7,8,9
]
.
these
four
impressive
press
releases
provide
the
first
evidence
that
vaccines
based
on
previously
unproven
technologies
can
significantly
contribute
to
the
control
of
a
pandemic
that
to
date
has
caused
more
than
1.5
million
deaths
[
10
]
.within
a
few
months
after
the
identification
of
the
new
sars-cov-2
,
the
freely
available
data
made
by
numerous
laboratories
around
the
world
provided
a
defined
picture
of
the
virus
structure
and
of
the
steps
of
human
cell
infection
.
a
sars-cov-2
is
an
oily
spherical
particle
containing
a
single-stranded
positive-sense
rna
of
about
30
kb
wrapped
and
coiled
by
the
nucleocapsid
protein
.
the
virus
outer
shell
consists
of
three
other
structural
glycoproteins
:
spike
,
envelope
,
and
membrane
,
and
a
lipid
coating
.
on
the
surface
of
sars-cov-2
,
three
spike
glycoproteins
aggregate
protrudes
outside
the
pericapsid
and
may
interact
at
a
high
affinity
with
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
2
(
ace2
)
,
an
exopeptidase
normally
present
on
the
outer
surface
of
a
wide
variety
of
human
cells
.
b
the
spike
protein
consists
of
two
domains
,
s1
and
s2
.
in
the
most
external
domain
,
a
region
known
as
receptor-binding
domain
(
rbd
)
,
allows
the
high-affinity
binding
of
the
sars-cov-2
to
the
n-terminal
domain
of
the
ace2
.
the
progressive
elucidation
of
the
critical
role
of
this
interaction
provided
the
key
insights
that
spurred
several
developers
of
innovative
vaccine
to
target
the
spike
protein
and
its
rbd
[
2
,
66
]
.
the
recent
reports
on
the
protective
efficacy
of
vaccines
based
on
different
platforms
targeting
the
spike
protein
[
6,7,8,9
]
suggest
that
the
freely
available
basic
science
data
allowed
to
make
a
winning
bet
[
10
]
.it
will
be
important
to
compare
the
intensity
and
duration
of
the
protective
responses
elicited
by
these
four
vaccines
with
those
induced
by
vaccines
based
on
technological
platforms
that
are
slower
to
develop
.
other
vaccine
candidates
that
are
coming
might
work
better
than
the
first
,
provide
a
longer
immunity
,
while
other
factors
such
as
cost
or
side
effects
might
offer
benefits
to
specific
groups
,
such
as
the
elderly
,
pregnant
women
,
or
people
in
low-income
countries
[

.the
history
of
vaccination
begins
with
vaccines
based
on
a
living
microbe
that
has
been
weakened
so
it
can
not
cause
disease
.
since
attenuated
microbes
retain
the
ability
to
replicate
in
vivo
giving
rise
to
a
limited
disease
,
they
are
very
effective
in
stimulating
the
immune
system
and
inducing
a
strong
and
persistent
immune
memory
that
is
efficacious
in
preventing
infection
.
hundreds
of
millions
of
people
have
been
protected
from
disabling
and
fatal
diseases
by
using
attenuated
vaccines
[
1
]
.this
is
the
most
traditional
technology
exploited
in
the
construction
of
vaccines
.
live
attenuated
vaccines
can
be
obtained
by
growing
the
virus
in
unfavorable
conditions
or
by
generating
a
genetically
weakened
version
of
the
virus
.
however
,
the
attenuation
of
trillions
of
viruses
is
complex
and
delicate
and
can
be
associated
with
major
biosafety
risks
[

]
.
once
produced
,
their
storage
and
handling
require
carefully
observed
procedures.the
experience
with
attenuated
virus
vaccines
shows
that
rare
but
significant
side
effects
could
be
expected
since
attenuated
viruses
cause
disease
,
even
if
this
is
a
minor
one
.
the
oral
route
(
as
in
the
case
of
the
sabin
polio
vaccine
)
and
the
intranasal
route
could
induce
a
mucosal
immunity
based
on
secretory
iga
and
igm.only
three
projects
of
attenuated
sars-cov-2
vaccines
are
in
active
preclinical
development
at
the
following
institutions
:

;

turkey.none
of
these
vaccine
projects
have
yet
reached
the
stage
of
clinical
trials.vaccines
based
on
killed
microorganisms
(
inactivated
vaccines
)
belong
to
a
very
traditional
technological
platform
that
has
led
to
numerous
vaccines
.
the
vaccines
produced
using
this
method
are
more
stable
than
live
attenuated
vaccines
but
their
limit
is
mainly
related
to
the
short
duration
of
immune
memory
which
demands
inoculation
of
higher
amounts
of
vaccine
or
the
association
of
the
inactivated
microorganism
with
an
adjuvant
.
the
immune
response
elicited
is
directed
not
only
against
the
spike
protein
but
also
against
many
other
sars-cov-2
antigens
.
while
the
induced
response
is
generally
weaker
concerning
that
induced
by
attenuated
viruses
,
the
vaccine
is
more
easily
handled
,
less
expensive
,
and
much
safer.the
sars-cov-2
is
inactivated
by
exploiting
different
chemical
techniques
.
all
these
candidate
vaccines
are
injected
intramuscularly.seven
vaccine
candidates
based
on
variously
inactivated
sars-cov-2
virions
are
in
clinical
trials
,
four
of
which
in
phase
iii
trials
and
already
approved
for
limited
use
(

)
.
when
available
,
reports
from
phase
ii
trials
suggest
that
the
vaccine
is
safe
and
induces
a
high
titer
of
antibodies
.
the
seven
clinical
trials
are
run
by
:
sinovac

china

this

are
several
human
vaccines
based
on
proteins
present
on
the
surface
of
microbes
[
1
]
.
initially
,
these
proteins
were
purified
from
the
microbes
while
today
,
in
most
of
the
cases
,
they
are
produced
in
vitro
exploiting
the
recombinant
dna
technology.the
large
trimeric
aggregates
of
the
spike
protein
that
protrude
outside
the
virion
play
an
essential
role
in
the
docking
of
the
sars-cov-2
to
human
cells
.
therefore
,
the
spike
protein
or
its
fragments
are
the
targets
of
all
these
vaccines
even
if
in
a
few
cases
other
sars-cov-2
proteins
-mostly
the
nucleoprotein
(
n
)
-
are
also
targeted
.
to
activate
a
robust
immune
response
,
often
these
vaccines
exploit
adjuvants
,
either
of
bacterial
or
synthetic
origin.there
are
very
numerous
vaccine
projects
based
on
sars-cov-2
proteins
,
their
fragments
,
or
their
fragments

at
least
sixteen
candidate
vaccines
are
already
in
human
trials
and
two
in

ii

(

)
:
these
vaccines
are
probably
the
most
immunogenic
also
thanks
to
the
combination
with
new
adjuvants

of

ore

it
is
not
uncommon
that
different

may
potentiate
the
intensity
of
the

immune
response

alternatively
,
a
lower
first
dose
of
the
vaccine
may
not
elicit
a
strong
reaction
against
the
chimpanzee
adenovirus
(
fig
.

)
.
in
the
absence
of
a
strong
antibody
response
,
the
adenovirus
could
more
effectively
deliver
the
mrna
during
the
booster
vaccination
.
this
is
also
the
rationale
for
the
sputnik

,
which
uses
a
different
type
of
adenovirus
in

what
about

although
any

and
the

will
be
assessed
on
a
long
series
of
data
for

,
it
will
likely
be
a
long
time
before
industrial
policies
and
national
political
issues
could
allow
a
solid
comparative
assessment
of
the
efficacy
of
the
various
vaccines
.
quantitative
comparisons
of
the
efficacy
of
different
vaccines
in
inducing
immune
responses
are
hampered
by
the
lack
of
international
standards
.
for
instance
,
there
is
no
international
standard
at
the
moment
for
titrating
igg
anti-spike
serum
antibodies
,
let
alone
for

assays
or
t
cell
responses
.
this
current
technological
limitation
makes
it
difficult
to
compare
immune
responses
elicited
by
vaccines
in
different
trials.it
is
also
conceivable
that
“
the

”
covid-19
vaccine
could
not
exist
at
all
,
as
vaccines
developed
on
distinct
technological
platforms
could
induce
different
forms
of
immunity
,
each
of
them
appropriate
in
different
environmental
and
human
contexts
.
the
polio
vaccine
provides
an
interesting
example
.
the
injectable
killed
salk
vaccine
is
turning
out
to
be
appropriate
for
the
industrialized
world
:
it
is
safe
and
effective
in
areas
of
the
world
where
polio
no
longer
exists
.
by
contrast
,
the
attenuated
sabin
vaccine
,
more
effective
and
easier
to
be
administered
orally
,
is
appropriate
for
the
developing
world
where
the
wild
virus
is
still
circulating
.
thus
,
the
evolution
of
the
pandemic
could
make
some
vaccines
more
appropriate
in
different
geographic
contexts
or
for
different
clusters
(
e.g.
,
infants
,
elderly
)
of
the
human
population
[

.
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
sequential
arrival
of
subsequent
wages
of
vaccines
could
increase
and
make
more
appropriate
the
protection
initially
induced
by
the
first
vaccines.it
is
expected
that
the
first
vaccines
that
will
be
made
available
will
significantly
contribute
to
the
normalization
of
social

,
even
if
their
arrival
will
be
accompanied
by
a
long
list
of

most
of
these

are
inherently
associated
with
the
dramatic
pressure
brought
on
by

and
the
reactive
speed
at

the
passage

as

well
in

even
if

are
not

among

that
can
be

there
is
the

complex
social
policy
issues
and
the
acceptance
or
rejection
of
vaccination
by
the
population
will
significantly
affect
the
possibility
of
achieving
this
crucial
goal.the
administration
of
a
new
vaccine
must
always
be
carefully
associated
with
a
rigorous
study
of
its
safety
.
this
is
particularly
important
because
a
vaccine
is
not
a
drug
for
sick
people
at
risk
of
dying
,
but
rather
a
treatment
that
is
given
to
those
who
are
well
to
prevent
the
risk
of
falling
ill
[

]
.the
race
to
develop
a
covid-19
vaccine
is
not
only
justified
but
necessary
.
however
,
the
time
required
to
evaluate
the
dangers
and
risks
that
may
arise
from
a
new
vaccine
must
be
included
in
its
development
.
in
some
cases
,
vaccines
prepared
against
other
coronaviruses
or
other
viruses
have
worsened
the
disease
[
45
]
and
have
induced
t
helper
2-type
immunopathology
[
46

.
these
issues
must
be
carefully
evaluated
and
excluded
before
a
new
covid-19
vaccine
is
distributed
to
combat
the
pandemic
or
its
subsequent
outbreaks
.
these
basic
considerations
take
on
special
importance
when
inappropriate
political
pressures
may
lead
to
accelerating
the
evaluation
of
vaccine
safety
.

to
keep
rigorous
efficacy
and

standards
as
an
absolutely
central
issue
in
covid-19
vaccine
development
are
reassuring.at
the
time
of
writing
,
there
are
over
5000
complete
sequencing
data
of
viral
isolates
reported
,
and
at
least
three
peer-reviewed
papers
available
[
47,48,49
]
.
sars-cov-2
is
relatively
stable
and
no
evidence
has
been
obtained
that
an
attenuated
virus
has
spread
globally
.
for
instance
,
sequencing
of
346
virus
isolates
in
the
lombardy
region
has
shown
that
the
spike
protein
does
not
undergo
mutations
including
at
glycosylation
sites
.
the
relative
stability
of
sars-cov-2
,
unlike
hiv
,
provides
a
strong
rationale
for
vaccine
development
.
however
,
following
the
introduction
of
an
effective
vaccine
(
s
)
,
the
mutant
virus
may
appear
and
have
a
selective
advantage
,
thus
posing
the
issue
of
adapting
the
vaccine
strategy.there
is
strong
evidence
that
selected
vaccines
confer
what
has
been
referred
to
as
pathogen-agnostic
protection
against
infectious
agents
unrelated
to
the
one
specifically
targeted
[
50,51,52,53
]
.for
instance
,
the
measles
and
bcg
vaccines
are
strongly
associated
with
a
reduced
incidence
of
unrelated
respiratory
tract
infections
[
54
]
.
the
mechanisms
of
pathogen-agnostic
protection
are
complex
and
include
avoidance
of
virus-induced
immunosuppression
and
increased
effectiveness
(
“
training
”
)
of
innate
immunity
.
the
evidence
for
pathogen-agnostic
protection
and
training
of
innate
immunity
is
strong
for
bcg
[
52
]
.
moreover
,
it
has
been
speculated
that
the
intense
vaccination
calendar
for
children
contributes
to
their
as
yet
unexplained
resistance
to
covid-19
.
based
on
these
considerations
several
prospective
clinical
trials
are
ongoing
aimed
to
assess
the
value
of
bcg
for
instance
for
the
protection
of
health
care
workers
.
at
this
stage
,
usage
of
bcg
as
a
preventive
measure
against
covid-19
can
not
be
recommended
outside
of
clinical
trials
[
52
]
.
however
,
available
information
suggests
that
vaccines
such
as
influenza
,
pneumococcus
,
and
herpes
in
the
elderly
represent
a
general
training
strategy
for
innate
and
adaptive
immunity
.
moreover
,
it
will
be
important
to
assess
whether
anti-sars-cov-2
vaccines
increase
immunological
fitness
as
this
may
be
relevant
to
fight

variants.once
the

will
be
related
to

technological
,
organizational
,

,
and
economic
problems
will
have
to
be
overcome
.
the
industrial
technology
needed
to
scale
up
the
production
to
a
billion
doses
will
depend
on
which
kind
of
vaccine
will
work
best
.
initially
,
it
might
not
be
physically
possible
to
make

,
although
,
various
vaccines
are
already
in
production
without
being
sure
that
they
will
be
registered

distributed
.
besides
,
political
and
economic
constraints
may
limit
vaccine
access
to
the
country
that
produces
it
or
to
the
countries
that
can
afford
to
pay
for
it
.
to
make
the
new
vaccines
available
to
the
global
population
will
be
challenging
[
55
]
.
the
problem
of
a
fair
distribution
of

in
all
the
nations
of
the
world
is
much
discussed
and
various
initiatives
are
about

.the
enthusiasm

is
also
plaguing
the

a

with
the

movements
against

have
flourished
in

western
world
.
currently
,
the
news
on
anti-covid-19
vaccines
have
further
ignited
opposition
protests
[

,
63
]
.
in
addition
to
the
movements
openly
opposed
to
vaccination
,
several
polls
show
that
a
significant
percentage
of
people
in
the
western
countries
would
be
hesitant
or
contrary
to
take
a
covid-19
vaccine
once
it
is
approved
.
the
chief
concern
among
those
surveyed
was
that
the
vaccine
approval
process
would
move
too
quickly
without
taking
the
time
to
properly
establish
safety
and
effectiveness
.
certainly
,
the
intrusion
of
political
issues
into
the
pace
of
the
vaccine
evaluation
process
does
not
help
to
build
confidence
in
new
vaccines
.
however
,
by
the
time

are
registered
and
made
available
,
data
on
their
efficacy
and
safety
will
have
been
carefully
reviewed
by

national

international
agencies
.
on
the
other
hand
,
these

will
have
had
a
short
documentation

and
might
elicit
hypothetical
side
effects
after
a
long
time
,
that
could
not
have
been
previously
appreciated.this
is
,
however
,
a
conjectural
situation

instead
,
it
is
likely
that
,
once
the
efficacy
of
a
covid-19
vaccine
will
be
demonstrated
,
much
of
the
hesitation
about
this
vaccination
will
quickly
vanish
.
it
will
be
commonly
apparent
that
a
marked
reduction
in
the
risk
of
dying
from
covid-19
largely
compensates
for
the
risk
of
hypothetical
late
side
effects.attempts
to
obtain
these
vaccines
at
any
cost
are
almost
mirroring
the
vaccine
mistrust
.

.the
pandemic
drama
has
prompted
many
scientists
around
the
world
to
design

alternative
covid-19

.
thus
,
in

to
the
large
number
of
official
projects
enlisted
by
who
[

,
numerous
university
laboratories

intellectual
and
technological
effort
provides
myriads
of
diverse
projects
,
some
of
which
could
become

confer

partial
protection

,
bacteriophage-based
vaccines
that
infect
nose

throat
microbes
and
make
them
produce
the
spike
protein
,
or
other
vaccines
that
could
be
administered
by
nasal
insufflation
or
by
mouth
appear
to
be
stimulating
alternatives
.
it
would
really
be
a
great
achievement
to
develop
a
vaccine
that
can
induce
an
effective
immunity
on
the
mucosal
surfaces
:
it
could
impede
the
viral
infection
and
the
virus
spread
through
respiratory
droplets.the
success
and
approval
of
the
first
covid-19
vaccines
should
not
detract
from
the
enthusiasm
and
practical
possibility
of
planning
new
studies
leading
to
the
development

production
of

as
the

[

.
indeed
,
covid-19
eradication
is
going
to
be
a
long
and
winding
road
that
will
not
finish
once
we
have
the
first
vaccine
available.as
we
are
completing
this
briefing
,
the
covid-19
vaccines
are
on
the
way
.
currently
,
fresh
data
from
phase
iii
trials
are
permitting
vaccine
registration
.
soon
after
,
few
vaccines
based
on
different
technologies
will
be
mandatory
or
made
available
for
selected
clusters
of
the
population
of
china
,
russia
,
the
united
states
,
and
europe.thus
,
the
landscape
of
the
pandemic
is
taking
on
completely
different
features
.
we
will
know
if
vaccines
to
efficaciously
control
the
sars-cov-2
virus
spreading
remain
a
far
goal
or
if
they
are
already
here
.
in
the
latter
case
,
the
next
burning
issue
will
be
vaccine
availability
and
its
equitable
distribution
in
all
areas
of
the
world
.
predatory
national
politics
aimed
at
ensuring
that
the
first
vaccine
doses
are
made
available
to
the
population
of
their
nation
will
clash
with
attempts
of
many
international
organizations
to
set
up
a
more
fair
distribution
in
all
countries
of
the
world
.
this
noble
effort
is
severely
contrasted
by
the
political
significance
that
the
covid-19
vaccine
is
assuming
.
the
political
leader
or
the
country
that
produces
a
first
salvific
vaccine
can
exploit
it
to
affirm
its
ability
to
protect
its
citizens
as
well
as
the
inhabitants
of
friendly
countries
.
the
vaccine
,
thus
,
may
become
an
inappropriate
measure
of
power
[
48

]
.
how
many
seeds
of
disease
,
despair
,
and
death
will
difficult
access
to
the
vaccine
sow
among
the
people
of
the
earth
?
cynically
,
it
could
just
be
the
relentless
predatory
rush
to
grab
the
first
doses

are
a
group
of

that
can
cause

there
are
seven

,
are
highly
pathogenic
and
can
lead
to
severe

and
fatal
outcome
in
infected
patients
.
the
first
lethal
coronavirus
sars-cov
emerged
in
2002
in
guangdong
province
,
china
.
during
the
2002–2004
outbreak
,
sars-cov
had
infected
8,098
people
and
resulted
in
774
sars-associated
deaths
(
~
10
%

rate
)
across
29
countries
before
it
disappeared
[

.
in
2012
,
mers-cov
emerged
in
saudi
arabia
.
it
caused
two
outbreaks
in
south
korea
in
2015
and
in
saudi
arabia
in
2018
,
and
still
has
ongoing
reports
of

nowadays
.
as
of

,
there
are
2,519
confirmed

and
866
deaths
(

in
december
2019
,
a
new
type
of
cov
that
can

the
clinical
manifestation

compared
with
sars-cov
and

,
sars-cov-2
is
highly
contagious
with
an
estimated
reproductive
number
of
2.2
(
one
existing
covid-19

can
cause
an

in
addition
,
its
ability

has
posed
a
great
challenge
to

.
by
october
2020
,

has
infected
more
than
43
million

resulted
in
about
1.15

needless
to
say
,
covid-19
has
become
the
most
serious
public
health
crisis
of
our
generation
and
has
a
profound
impact
on
the
global

although
our
understanding
of

been
steadily
accumulating
for
about
two
decades
,
no

has
yet
been
approved
for
the

considering
the
rapid

the
s
protein
is
particularly
important
for
virus-cell
receptor
binding
and
virus-cell
membrane
fusion
,
suggesting
that
it
can
be
an
effective
target
for
cov
vaccine
design
[
15
]
.
in
fact
,
studies
have
shown
that
antibodies
generated
against
the
s
protein
are
long-lasting
and
immunodominant
in
recovered
sars
patients
[
18
,
19
]
.
in
addition
,
several
studies
have
demonstrated
that
the
anti-s
antibody
can
neutralize
sars-cov
and
mers-cov
and
provides
protective
effects
in
animals
and
humans
[
20,21,22
]
.
moreover
,
many
s
protein-based
vaccines
against
sars-cov
and
mers-cov
have
been
shown
to
elicit
potent
immune
responses
and
protective
effects
in
preclinical
models
[
23,24,25,26,27
]
.
these
results
corroborate
that
cov
s
protein
serves
as
an
ideal
vaccine
target
to
induce
neutralizing
antibodies
and
protective
immunity
.
besides
s
protein
,
other
structural
proteins
have
also
been
tested
as
vaccine
targets
.
n
protein-based
vaccines
usually
can
not
induce
neutralizing
antibodies
,
likely
due
to
the
fact
that
n
protein
is
not
displayed
on
the
cov
surface
[
16
]
.
however
,
n
protein
has
the
advantage
of
being
more
conserved
across
cov
species
than
s
protein
,
making
it
a
potential
target
for
a
t-cell
inducing
,
universal
cov
vaccine
[
16
]
.
one
recent
study
has
shown
that
a
viral
vector
vaccine
expressing
n
protein
can
induce
cd4+
t
cell-dependent
protection
against
sars-cov
and
mers-cov
,
suggesting
the
feasibility
of
n
protein-based
t-cell
inducing
cov
vaccines
[
28
]
.
m
protein-based
vaccines
,
on
the
other
hand
,
can
induce
a
high
titer
of
antibody
response
in
immunized
animals
[
29
]
.
however
,
no
neutralization
antibody
or
protective
immunity
data
of
m
protein-based
vaccines
in
preclinical
models
have
been
demonstrated
.
finally
,
very
few
cov
e
protein-based
immunization
studies
have
been
reported
so
far
,
and
none
of
the
studies
demonstrated
induction
of
neutralizing
antibodies
or
protective
immunity
[
30
]
.there
are
also
immunopathological
complications
associated
with
the
sars-cov
and
mers-cov
vaccines
that
require
addressing
and
further
optimization
.
one
adverse
effect
is
the
induction
of
antibody-dependent
enhancement
(
ade
)
effect
,
which
is
usually
caused
by
vaccine-induced
suboptimal
antibodies
that
facilitates
viral
entry
into
host
cells
[
11
,
31
]
.
a
study
found
that
sars-cov
vaccine
based
on
full-length
s
protein
enhances
sars-cov
infection
of
human
cell
lines
in
vitro
[
32
]
.
additionally
,
two
studies
have
also
shown
that
anti-s
protein
serum
results
in
increased
viral
infectivity
of
sars-cov
[
33
,
34
]
.
these
results
raise
safety
concerns
for
s
protein-based
sars-cov
and
mers-cov
vaccines
.
one
potential
strategy
to
overcome
the
ade
problem
is
to
design
vaccines
that
only
contain
major
neutralizing
epitopes
,
such
as
the
s1
subunit
or
the
rbd
domain
of
the
s
protein
.
this
strategy
can
decrease
the
induction
of
non-neutralizing
antibodies
by
cov
vaccines
and
therefore
reduce
the
ade
effect
.
another
potential
adverse
effect
is
vaccine-induced
eosinophilic
immunopathology
,
which
is
an
unwanted
th2-skewed
immune
response
elicited
by
vaccination
[
11
,
35
]
.
at
least
two
studies
have
reported
that
whole
inactivated
virus
vaccine
of
sars-cov
induces
eosinophilic
proinflammatory
pulmonary
response
after
mice
challenged
with
sars-cov
[
36
,
37
]
.
in
addition
,
one
study
also
reported
that
immunization
with
sars-cov
virus-like
particle
(
vlp
)
vaccine
leads
to
eosinophilic
immunopathology
in
the
lung
after
viral
challenge
[
37
]
.
in
order
to
prevent
this
th2-type
immunopathology
,
a
few
studies
have
worked
on
adjuvant
optimization
.
they
found
that
appropriate
adjuvants
,
such
as
toll-like
receptor
agonist
and
delta-inulin
polysaccharide
,
can

]
.
their
results
provide
a
promising
strategy
to
deal
with
th2-skewed
immune
response
induced
by
some
cov
vaccines.various
forms
of
vaccines
targeting
sars-cov
and
mers-cov
have
been
developed
and
tested
in
preclinical
models
.
however
,
only
a
few
of
them
entered
clinical
trials
and
none
of
them
have
been
fda
approved
.
these
approaches
include
protein
subunit
vaccines
,
virus-like
particle
vaccines
,
dna
vaccines
,
viral
vector
vaccines
,
whole-inactivated
vaccines
and
live-attenuated
vaccines
.
the
following
sections
outline
the
principles
of
various
forms
of
sars-cov
and
mers-cov
vaccine
development
(
table

)
,
and
the
latest
results
from
both
preclinical
studies
and
clinical
trials
(
table

)
.protein
subunit
vaccines
consist
of
viral
antigenic
fragments
produced
by
recombinant
protein
techniques
.
they
are
easy
to
produce
,
and
relatively
safe
and
well-tolerated
compared
to
whole
virus
vaccines
and
viral
vector
vaccines
.
the
drawback
of
protein
subunit
vaccines
is
their
low
immunogenicity
.
therefore
,
adjuvants
and
fusion
with
immunostimulatory
molecules
are
usually
used
together
with
subunit
vaccines
to
overcome
this
challenge.the
development
of
sars-cov
protein
subunit
vaccines
was
initially
surrounding
full-length
s
protein-based
vaccines
and
then
later
focused
on
s
protein
rbd-based
vaccines
.
none
of
the
sars-cov
protein
subunit
vaccines
entered
clinical
trials
,
but
they
induced
potent
antibody
responses
and
protective
effects
in
preclinical
models
[
23
,
24
,
32
,
40,41,42,43,44
]
.
studies
have
shown
that
full-length
s
protein
,
extracellular
domain
of
the
s
protein
,
and
trimeric
s
proteins
(
trispike
)
are
all
immunogenic
and
can
elicit
protection
against
sars-cov
infection
[
23
,
24
,
32
]
.
however
,
kam
et
al
.
and
jamue
et
al
.
have
found
that
trispike
vaccine
can
also
cause
fcγ
receptor
ii
(
fcγrii
)
-dependent
sars-cov
infection
in
human
b
cells
in
vitro
[
32
,
33
]
.
on
the
other
hand
,
s
protein
rbd-based
vaccines
are
able
to
induce
high-titer
neutralizing
antibodies
without
causing
obvious
pathogenic
effects
[
40,41,42,43,44
]
.
this
is
probably
because
rbd-based
vaccines
do
not
contain
additional
non-neutralizing
epitopes
as
full-length
s
protein
vaccines
do
.
one
study
has
shown
that
rbd-based
vaccines
not
only
protect
most
of
the
sars-cov
challenged
mice
with
no
detectable
viral
rna
in
the
lung
,
but
can
also
induce
long-lasting
s-specific
antibodies
that
can
be
maintained
for
12
months
[
42
]
.
furthermore
,
rbd-based
sars-cov
vaccines
have
also
been
shown
to
induce
rbd-specific
ifn-γ
producing
cellular
immune
responses
in
mice
[
44
]
.
as
a
result
,
sars-cov
rbd
has
become
the
main
target
for
sars
vaccines
.
finally
,
sars-cov
subunit
vaccines
based
on
s2
subunit
,
n
and
m
structural
proteins
have
also
been
tested
[
29
,
45
,
46
]
.
however
,
no
evidence
has
shown
that
they
can
induce
neutralizing
antibodies
or
protective
effects
against
viral
challenge.guided
by
previous
sars-cov
experiences
,
most
proteins
subunit
vaccines
of
mers-cov
are
focused
on
rbd-based
vaccines
.
rbd-based
mers-cov
vaccines
generally
show
great
immunogenicity
and
elicit
potent
neutralizing
antibodies
,
cell-mediated
immunity
,
and
protective
effect
against
mers-cov
infection
[
25
,
26
]
.
one
study
from
tai
et
al
.
found
that
trimeric
rbd
protein
vaccines
can
induce
long-lasting
neutralizing
antibodies
for
6
months
[
26
]
.
another
study
also
from
tai
et
al
.
demonstrated
that
recombinant
rbd
proteins
from
different
mers-cov
strains
can
induce
antibodies
that
cross-neutralize
with
divergent
human
and
camel
mers-cov
strains
[
25
]
.
these
results
indicate
that
mers-cov
rbd
serves
as
a
promising
vaccine
target
with
the
ability
to
induce
long-lasting
and
broad-spectrum
neutralizing
antibodies
against
infection
.
other
than
rbd-based
vaccines
,
rbd-containing
s1
subunit
vaccines
have
also
been
shown
to
induce
neutralizing
antibodies
and
protection
against
mers-cov
[
47
,
48
]
.
notably
,
the
n-terminal
domain
(
ntd
)
of
the
s
protein
binds
to
sialic
acid
and
is
important
for
mers-cov
infection
in
certain
cell
types
.
jiaming
et
al
.
showed
that
immunization
with
ntd-based
vaccine
also
provides
protection
against
mers-cov
and
induces
potent
humoral
and
cell-mediated
immunity
[
49
]
.
however
,
since
sars-cov-2
ntd
does
not
have
the
same
sialic
acid-binding
function
as
mers-cov
,
ntd-based
strategy
might
not
be
generalizable
to
sars-cov-2
vaccine
development.apart
from
antigen
design
,
several
other
factors
also
affect
the
efficacy
of
protein
subunit
vaccines
[
16
]
.
the
expression
system
of
protein
influences
the
quality
and
quantity
of
protein
subunit
vaccines
.
du
et
al
.
demonstrated
that
sars-cov
rbd
protein
expressed
by
mammalian
293t
cells
induces
stronger
neutralizing
antibody
responses
than
rbd
expressed
by
insect
cells
and
e.
coli
,
which
is
probably
due
to
the
native
conformation
and
post-translational
modification
maintained
in
mammalian
cellular
system
[
43
]
.
in
addition
,
adjuvants
play
an
important
role
in
enhancing
the
immunogenicity
of
protein
subunit
vaccines
.
zhang
et
al
.
have
examined
multiple
adjuvants
(
freund
’
s
,
aluminum
,
monophosphoryl
lipid
a
,
montanide
isa51
and
mf59
)
in
conjugation
with
mers-cov
rbd
and
found
that
mf59
best
potentiate
the
protein
to
elicit
neutralizing
antibodies
and
protective
effects
[
50
]
.
their
data
provide
a
good
starting
point
for
optimizing
adjuvants
for
sars-cov-2
subunit
vaccines
.
moreover
,
the
immunization
route
of
the
subunit
vaccine
can
also
affect
its
potency
,
and
in
combination
with
different
antigen
and
adjuvants
,
the
optimized
vaccination
pathway
may
change
.
for
example
,
li
et
al
.
demonstrated
that
for
sars-cov
s
and
s1
subunit
vaccine
,
intramuscular
(
i.m
.
)
route
induces
stronger
antibody
responses
than
subcutaneous
(
s.c.
)
route
,
while
lan
et
al
.
showed
that
s.c.
route
is
preferable
over
i.m
.
injection
for
freund
’
s
and
cpg-adjuvanted
mers-cov
rbd
vaccine
[
23
,
51
]
.
therefore
,
the
ideal
route
might
need
to
be
customized
for
sars-cov-2
subunit
vaccines.virus-like
particles
(
vlps
)
are
self-assembled
viral
structural
proteins
that
mimic
the
conformation
of
native
viruses
but
lack
the
viral
genome
.
compared
with
protein
subunit
vaccines
,
vlp
vaccines
present
epitope
in
conformation
that
is
more
similar
to
the
native
virus
,
leading
to
better
immunization
responses
.
in
addition
,
compared
to
whole
virus
vaccines
,
the
production
of
vlp
vaccines
does
not
involve
live
virus
or
inactivation
steps
,
which
makes
them
safer
vaccine
candidates
.
the
highly
repetitive
antigenic
surface
of
vlp
vaccines
also
help
induce
stronger
antibody
response
by
efficiently
cross-linking
b-cell
surface
receptors
.
up
to
now
,
vlp
vaccines
have
been
commercialized
for
the
protection
against
human
papillomavirus
(
cervarix™
and
gardasil®
)
and
hepatitis
b
virus
(
engerix®
and
recombivax
hb®
)
[
52
]
.few
sars-cov
and
mers-cov
vlp
vaccines
have
been
reported
so
far
.
for
sars-cov
,
lokugamage
et
al
.
have
demonstrated
that
chimeric
vlps
composed
of
sars-cov
s
protein
and
mouse
hepatitis
virus
e
,
m
and
n
proteins
can
induce
neutralizing
antibody
responses
and
reduce
sars-cov
virus
titer
in
mice
lung
after
viral
challenge
[
53
]
.
in
addition
,
another
study
performed
by
liu
et
al
.
showed
that
chimeric
vlps
consisting
of
sars-cov
s
protein
and
influenza
virus
m1
protein
can
induce
neutralizing
antibodies
and
provide
protection
against
lethal
challenge
in
mice
[
54
]
.
however
,
one
study
used
the
same
chimeric
vlps
as
lokugamage
et
al
.
and
showed
that
this
vlp
vaccine
can
lead
to
pulmonary
immunopathology
on
challenge
with
sars-cov
[
37
,
53
]
.
therefore
,
potential
adverse
effects
of
coronavirus
vlp
vaccines
should
be
monitored
.
for
mers-cov
vlp
vaccines
,
wang
et
al
.
have
shown
that
vlps
containing
mers-cov
s
,
e
and
m
proteins
can
induce
specific
antibody
response
and
th1-mediated
cellular
immunity
in
rhesus
macaques
[
55
]
.
the
same
research
group
developed
another
chimeric
vlp
vaccine
containing
the
fusion
of
the
receptor-binding
domain
(
rbd
)
of
mers-cov
s
protein
and
the
canine
parvovirus
(
cpv
)
vp2
structural
protein
[
56
]
.
they
showed
that
this
vlp
vaccine
induces
mers-cov-specific
antibody
response
and
t-cell
immunity
in
mice
[
56
]
.
these
studies
suggested
that
vlp
vaccines
hold
the
potential
for
clinically
effective
coronavirus
vaccines.dna
vaccines
contain
genes
encoding
viral
antigenic
components
that
are
expressed
by
plasmid
vectors
and
delivered
into
cells
through
electroporation
.
compared
with
other
vaccine
technologies
,
dna
vaccines
offer
a
fast
and
flexible
platform
for
vaccine
development
and
production
,
making
it
an
attractive
technology
to
combat
emerging
epidemics
like
sars-cov-2
.
in
addition
,
antigen
production
of
dna
vaccines
happens
in
the
target
cells
,
which
helps
recapitulate
the
native
conformation
and
post-translational
modification
of
viral
antigens
.
however
,
an
important
drawback
of
dna
vaccines
is
their
limited
immunogenicity
due
to
their
inability
to
spread
and
amplify
in
vivo
.
therefore
,
it
is
important
to
consider
strategies
that
can
enhance
the
potency
of
dna
vaccines
,
such
as
adding
adjuvant
or
using
a
prime-boost
regimen
.
besides
,
the
genomic
integration
of
dna
vaccines
into
the
host
chromosome
is
another
biosafety
concern
,
which
may
lead
to
mutagenesis
and
oncogenesis
[
57
]
.
even
though
previous
studies
have
shown
that
the
risk
of
vaccine
plasmid
insertion
into
the
host
chromosome
is
pretty
low
,
the
fda
and
the
who
still
recommends
integration
studies
be
included
as
part
of
the
safety
program
of
dna
vaccines
[
58
,
59
]
.several
dna
vaccine
candidates
have
been
reported
for
sars-cov
,
including
the
s-
,
m-
,
and
n
protein-based
vaccines
[
60,61,62,63,64
]
.
although
all
of
them
can
generate
a
certain
level
of
antibody
and
cell-immune
responses
,
only
s
protein-based
dna
vaccine
has
been
shown
to
induce
protective
effect
against
sars-cov
infection
,
probably
due
to
the
indispensable
role
of
s
protein
in
receptor
binding
[
60
]
.
yang
et
al
.
has
demonstrated
that
immunization
with
dna
encoding
full-length
s
protein
,
s
protein
lacking
part
of
cytoplasmic
domain
,
s
protein
lacking
both
cytoplasmic
and
transmembrane
domains
can
all
induce
neutralizing
antibodies
and
t-cell
immune
responses
,
as
well
as
providing
protective
effect
in
mice
[
60
]
.
this
promising
result
leads
to
a
following
phase
i
clinical
trial
based
on
sars-cov
full-length
s
protein
dna
vaccine
,
which
showed
that
the
vaccine
was
well-tolerated
in
patients
and
can
induce
neutralizing
antibodies
and
t
cell
responses
in
healthy
adults
[
65
]
.
furthermore
,
two
studies
have
made
use
of
prime-boost
strategy
to
enhance
the
potency
of
s
protein-based
sars-cov
dna
vaccine
.
zakhartchouk
et
al
.
reported
that
the
combination
of
dna
and
whole-inactivated
sars-cov
vaccines
can
increase
the
magnitude
of
antibody
response
as
well
as
inducing
a
more
desirable
th1-skewed
immune
response
[
66
]
.
woo
et
al
.
demonstrated
that
using
dna
vaccine
priming
plus
e.
coli
expressed
recombinant
s
protein
booster
can
also
induce
higher
neutralization
titers
than
dna
or
protein
subunit
vaccine
alone
[
67
]
.similar
to
sars-cov
,
several
studies
on
mers-cov
dna
vaccines
have
demonstrated
optimistic
results
.
muthumani
et
al
.
reported
that
a
full-length
s
protein-based
mers-cov
dna
vaccine
can
induce
potent
cellular
immunity
and
antigen-specific
neutralizing
antibodies
in
mice
,
macaques
,
and
camels
,
and
macaques
vaccinated
with
this
dna
vaccine
were
protected
against
mers-cov
challenge
without
demonstrating
any
clinical
or
radiographic
signs
of
pneumonia
[
68
]
.
building
on
these
encouraging
data
,
a
phase
i
clinical
trial
based
on
this
mers-cov
dna
vaccine
(
gls-5300
,
or
ino-4700
)
has
been
completed
[
69
]
.
the
results
showed
that
gls-5300
is
well
tolerated
with
no
vaccine-associated
serious
adverse
events
,
and
immunization
with
gls-5300
induces
durable
immune
responses
in
85
%
of
participants
after
two
vaccinations
[
69
]
.
these
data
support
further
development
of
the
gls-5300
vaccine
.
notably
,
a
sars-cov-2
dna
vaccine
candidate
,
ino-4800
,
is
based
on
the
same
design
as
gls-5300
,
and
this
vaccine
is
now
in
phase
i/ii
clinical
trial
(
nct04447781
and
nct04336410
)
[
70
]
.
in
addition
,
another
mers-cov
vaccine
study
using
full-length
s
protein
dna
priming
plus
s1
protein
subunit
booster
elicits
robust
serum-neutralizing
activity
against
several
mers-cov
strains
in
mice
and
rhesus
macaques
[
47
]
.
immunizing
rhesus
macaques
with
this
dna
prime/protein
boost
vaccine
confers
protection
against
mers-cov-induced
radiographic
pneumonia
,
supporting
this
strategy
as
a
promising
approach
for
mers-cov
vaccine
development
[
47
]
.
aside
from
full-length
s
,
s1
subunit
is
also
a
good
target
for
mers-cov
dna
vaccine
.
one
study
performed
by
al-amri
et
al
.
has
compared
the
immunogenicity
of
full-length
s-based
(
ps
)
and
s1-based
(
ps1
)
mers-cov
vaccine
using
the
same
expression
vector
[
71
]
.
they
found
that
ps1
immunization
elicited
a
balanced
th1/th2
response
and
generally
higher
levels
of
all
igg
isotypes
compared
to
ps
vaccination
,
which
may
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
the
transmembrane
domain-lacking
s1
subunit
is
secreted
more
efficiently
to
the
extracellular
space
and
therefore
result
in
greater
uptake
by
antigen-presenting
cells
[
71
]
.
this
study
suggested
that
s1
might
be
a
better
target
than
full-length
s
for
mers-cov
dna
vaccine
[
71
]
.taken
together
,
dna
vaccines
encoding
full-length
s
or
s1
protein
have
demonstrated
encouraging
results
to
fight
against
sars-cov
and
mers-cov
.
the
same
strategy
is
likely
to
be
generalizable
to
sars-cov-2
dna
vaccine
considering
the
biological
similarity.viral
vector
vaccines
are
recombinant
viruses
that
encode
antigens
of
interest
in
an
unrelated
modified
virus
.
they
deliver
antigen
into
the
cells
mimicking
natural
infection
,
so
they
induce
strong
antigen-specific
cellular
and
humoral
immune
responses
per
se
,
thereby
obviating
the
need
for
additional
adjuvants
.
in
addition
,
viral
vectors
are
able
to
accept
large
insertions
in
their
genome
,
providing
a
flexible
platform
for
antigen
design
.
despite
these
advantages
,
there
are
several
drawbacks
.
the
manufacturing
process
for
viral
vector
vaccines
is
more
complicated
than
other
approaches
,
including
the
optimization
of
cellular
systems
and
the
exclusion
of
contaminants
,
which
can
greatly
affect
the
efficiency
of
viral
vectors
[
57
]
.
moreover
,
recombinant
viruses
carry
the
risk
of
integrating
their
genome
into
the
human
host
,
so
additional
biosafety
assessment
will
be
required
before
entering
clinical
trials
.
finally
,
if
the
chosen
viral
vector
can
infect
the
general
populations
,
the
pre-existing
immunity
on
the
viral
vector
could
dampen
the
induced
immune
response
,
which
has
been
seen
in
adenovirus-
and
measle
virus-based
vaccines
[
72
,
73
]
.similar
to
dna
and
protein
subunit
vaccines
,
most

numerous
viral
vectors
have
been
used
to
develop
sars-cov
and
mers-cov
vaccines
,
which
have
been
described
in
detail
in
previous

in
the
following
sections

we
will
highlight
vaccines
based
on

and
venezuelan
equine
encephalitis
virus
,
which
are
the
most
well
studied
viral
vector
platforms
for
coronavirus
vaccines
.
we
will
also
briefly
introduce
other
recombinant
viral
platforms
that
are
being
actively
developed
for
coronavirus
vaccines.adenovirus
is
a
popular
viral
vector
vaccine
that
has
been
tested
in
clinical
trials
for
a
wide
variety
of
diseases
,
and
several
studies
have
also
examined
the
efficacy
of
adenovirus-based
sars-cov
vaccine

of

the
efficacy
of
sars-cov
s
protein
expressing
adenovirus
vaccine
with
the
whole
inactivated
sars-cov
vaccine
[
78
]
.
they
found
that
both
vaccines
induce
protective
effects
in
mice
against
sars-cov
challenge
,
though
the
neutralizing
antibody
response
is
weaker
in
adenovirus-based
vaccine
than
whole-inactivated
virus
vaccine
[

]
.
besides
,
kobinger
et
al
.
have
also
tested
a
prime-boost
regimen
of
s
protein-expressing
human
adenovirus
type
5
and
chimpanzee
derived
adenoviruses
in
ferrets
[
79
]
.
their
results
showed
that
this
vaccine
leads
to
a
substantial
reduction
in
viral
load
and
prevents
pneumonia
in
ferrets
after
sars-cov
challenge
[

.
all
these
results
have
encouraged
subsequent
development
of
adenovirus-based
mers
and
covid-19
vaccines.modified

that

expressing
sars-cov

,
but
they

however
,
another
two
studies
performed
by
weingartl

and
czub
et

showed
that
mva
vaccine
expressing
sars-cov

not
provide

it
even
induces

to
be
considered

further
improve
the

improved
the

by
substituting
an

.several
additional
viral

have
also
shown
promising
results
for
sars-cov
vaccines
.
two
studies
from
buchholz

have
used
an
attenuated
parainfluenza
virus
as
vector
to
express
sars-cov

showing
that

that

have
been
shown
to
induce

however
,
the
protection
effect
of
ad5-

vaccines
have
not
been
evaluated
[

.
notably
,
ad5-mers-s
vaccine
has
been
used
in
combination
with
s
protein
nanoparticles
[

.
heterologous
immunization
by
priming
with

boosting
with

nanoparticles
has
demonstrated
not

protective
effect
in

also
more
balanced

the
ad5
vector
has
already
been
applied
to

development
,
and
promising
results
have
been
demonstrated
in
phase
i
and
ii
clinical
trials
[
92
,
93
]
.besides
,
chimpanzee
adenovirus
has
been
employed
as
viral
vector
with
an
aim
to
overcome
the
pre-existing
immunity
problem
of
human
adenoviruses
.
a
mers-cov
s
protein
vaccine
based
on
a
chimpanzee
adenoviral
vector
(
chadox1
)
was
shown
to
induce
high
levels
of
neutralizing
antibodies
and
cell-mediated
immune
in
mice
,
and
to
protect
hdpp4-transduced
mice
from
lethal
mers-cov
challenge
[
94
,
95
]
.
in
addition
,
chadox1-mers
vaccine
has
also
been
demonstrated
to
reduce
viral
load
in
dromedary
camels
and
provide
protective
immunity
in
rhesus
macaques
[
96
,
97
]
.
given
these
promising
preclinical
results
,
the
chadox1-mers
vaccine
has
entered
a
phase
i
clinical
trial
,
and
the
trial
result
showed
that
chadox1-mers
was
safe
and
well
tolerated
at
all
tested
doses
,
and
a
single
dose
was
capable
of
inducing
both
humoral
and
cellular
responses
against
mers-cov
[
98
]
.
notably
,
the
same
research
team
has
applied
chadox1
platform
to
sars-cov-2
vaccine
development
and
their
product
azd1222
(
or
chadox1-ncov-19
)
is
now
a
leading
player
of
the
covid-19
vaccine
race
[
99
]
.the
vaccine
of
modified
vaccinia
virus
ankara
(
mva
)
expressing
full-length
mers-cov
s
protein
has
been
reported
to
induce
not
only
virus-neutralizing
antibody
responses
and
mers-cov-specific
cd8+
t
cell
response
,
but
also
provide
protective
effect
against
mers-cov
in
dpp4-transduced
mice
[
100
]
.
furthermore
,
dromedary
camels
immunized
with
this
mva-based
mers-cov
s
protein
vaccine
generate
neutralizing
antibodies
and
show
less
virus
excretion
after
mers-cov
infection
[
101
]
.
since
camel
is
a
major
animal
reservoir
for
mers-cov
,
this
vaccine
provides
an
opportunity
to
effectively
control
camel-to-human
transmission
[
101
]
.
finally
,
a
phase
i
clinical
trial
showed
that
mva-mers-s
vaccine
has
a
favorable
safety
profile
,
and
homologous
prime–boost
immunization
of
mva-mers-s
vaccine
induces
humoral
and
cell-mediated
immune
responses
against
mers-cov
,
which
supports
testing
mva-mers-s
vaccine
in
a
larger
population
[
102
]
.mers-cov
vaccines
dependent
on
venezuelan
equine
encephalitis
(
vee
)
virus
have
also
been
studied
.
agnihothram
et
al
.
have
demonstrated
that
vee
virus
replicon
particles
(
vrp
)
expressing
mers-cov
s
protein
can
induce
neutralizing
antibodies
in
young
and
aged
mice
[
103
]
.
another
study
from
zhao
et
al
.
found
that
vrp-based
mers
n

vaccine
can
induce
memory
cd4+
immune
response
and
provide
protective
immunity
against
mers-cov
in
hdpp4-transduced
mice
[
28
]
.
since
n
protein
is
more
conserved
than
s
protein
across
different
coronavirus
species
,
their
approach
might
hold
the
potential
to
develop
a
universal
t
cell-inducing
coronavirus
vaccine
[

]
.several
other
vaccine
platforms
have
been
applied
for
the
development
of

have
also
been
employed
as

[

.
however
,
only
in

summary
,
sars-cov
and
mers-cov
vaccines
based
on
many
viral
vectors
,
including
adenovirus
,
modified
vaccinia
virus
ankara
,
venezuelan
equine
encephalitis
virus
,
parainfluenza
virus
,
vesicular
stomatitis
virus
,
measle
virus
,
and
rabies
virus
,
have
been
shown
to
elicit
protective
immunity
against
viral
challenges
.
some
of
these
viral
vectors
has
already
become
promising
candidate
platforms
for
the
development
of
sars-cov-2
vaccine.whole
inactivated
vaccines
are
composed
of
chemically
or
radiationally
inactivated
virions
.
they
contain
a
full
repertoire
of
immunogenic
components
of
the
original
virus
,
and
compared
with
attenuated
viruses
,
they
carry
no
risk
of
viral
reactivation
if
properly
inactivated
.
although
safer
than
live
attenuated
vaccines
,
the
immunogenic
epitopes
of
inactivated
viruses
may
be
structurally
deformed
during
the
inactivation
process
,
which
can
undermine
the
protection
they
may
provide
.
moreover
,
both
sars-cov
and
mers-cov
whole
inactivated
vaccines
have
been
reported
to
induce
eosinophil-related
lung
pathology
[
36
,
37
]
.
these
disadvantages
make
whole
inactivated
vaccines
a
less
attractive
strategy
for
coronavirus
vaccine
development.during
the
early
development
of
sars-cov
vaccines
,
inactivated
whole
virus
was
once
a
leading
strategy
.
studies
have
shown
that
uv-
and
formaldehyde-inactivated
sars-cov
can
induce
neutralizing
antibody
response
,
and
a
phase
i
clinical
trial
using
β-propiolactone-inactivated
sars-cov
vaccine
demonstrated
that
it
is
safe
,
well-tolerated
,
and
can
elicit
sars-cov-specific
neutralizing
antibodies
[
108,109,110
]
.
however
,
later
studies
found
that
a
uv-formaldehyde
doubly
inactivated
sars-cov
vaccine
,
either
unadjuvanted
or
alum-adjuvanted
,
provides
incomplete
protection
in
mice
and
induces
eosinophilic
pulmonary
inflammatory
response
upon
sars-cov
challenge
[
36
]
.
similarly
,
gamma-irradiated
mers-cov
vaccine
adjuvanted
with
alum
or
mf59
also
induces
eosinophil-related
lung
pathology
after
virus
challenge
,
despite
its
ability
to
induce
neutralizing
antibodies
[
111
]
.
these
results
have
dampened
the
enthusiasm
of
whole-inactivated
coronavirus
vaccines
.
nevertheless
,
recently
two
studies
have
revealed
that
uv-inactivated
sars-cov
adjuvanted
with
toll-like
receptor
agonists
,
and
formaldehyde-inactivated
mers-cov
adjuvanted
with
alum
and
unmethylated
cpg
,
can
reduce
or
even
prevent
th2-skewed
lung
pathology
after
challenge
[
38
,
112
]
.
these
results
demonstrated
that
with
an
appropriate
combination
of
inactivation
method
and
adjuvants
,
the
whole
inactivated
virus
is
still
a
viable
option
for
coronavirus
vaccine
development.live
attenuated
vaccines
are
live
viruses
weakened
by
deleting
or
mutating
the
pathogenic
component
of
the
viral
genome
.
similar
to
whole
inactivated
vaccines
,
they
possess
nearly
the
full
immunogenic
components
of
the
original
virus
.
furthermore
,
they
preserve
the
native
conformation
of
viral
antigens
and
present
antigens
to
the
immune
system
as
in
natural
infections
.
therefore
,
live
attenuated
vaccines
are
the
most
immunogenic
kind
of
vaccine
and
have
a
long
history
of
success
in
controlling
a
variety
of
infectious
diseases
[
113
]
.
however
,
live
attenuated
vaccines
also
carry
a
higher
risk
than
other
types
of
vaccines
,
including
the
possibility
of
reversion
to
a
virulent
state
and
the
danger
of
persistent
infection
in
immunocompromised
patients
.
therefore
,
biosafety
of
live
attenuated
vaccines
needs
to
be
carefully
evaluated
before
proceeding
to
clinical
use.although
a
few
sars-cov
and
mers-cov
live
attenuated
vaccines
have
demonstrated
efficacy
in
animal
models
,
none
of
them
have
proceeded
to
clinical
trials
[

]
.
the
envelope
(
e
)
protein
,
besides
its
structural
roles
,
has
a
major
role
in
inflammasome
activation
and
is
associated
with
exacerbated
inflammation
in
the
lung
[
118
]
.
as
a
result
,
the
deletion
of
e
protein
can
lead
to
the
decreased
virulence
of
coronavirus
[
119
]
.
lamirande
et
al
.
has
reported
that
sars-cov
mutants
lacking
the
e
gene
can
induce
protective
effects
in
hamsters
against
sars-cov
challenge
[
114
]
.
in
addition
,
nonstructural
protein
16
(
nsp16
)
is
another
viable
target
for
the
coronavirus
vaccine
.
nsp16
encodes
ribose
2′-o-methyltransferase
that
is
required
for
5′
capping
of
viral
rna
[
120
]
.
this
methylation
helps
coronavirus
avoid
the
activation
of
type
i
interferon-dependent
innate
immune
response
by
viral
rna
,
and
therefore
nsp16
deletion
attenuates
virulence
[
120
]
.
both
sars-cov
and
mers-cov
nsp16
mutant
vaccines
have
been
reported
to
provide
protection
against
challenge
[
115
,
116
]
.
moreover
,
nonstructural
protein
14
(
nsp14
)
,
which
encodes
exoribonuclease
(
exon
)
involved
in
rna
proofreading
during
replication
,
is
also
an
useful
target
for
live
attenuated
coronavirus
vaccine
[
121
]
.
the
loss
of
exon
will
cause
a
profound
decrease
in
replication
fidelity
,
and
lead
to
attenuation
of
coronavirus
pathogenesis
[
121
]
.
graham
et
al
.
has
shown
that
exon
deletion
can
reduce
sars-cov
virulence
in
young
,
aged
,
immunocompromised
mice
,
and
exon-deleted
sars-cov
vaccine
can
induce
a
protective
effect
against
challenge
in
these
mice
[
117
]
.
in
sum
,
all
the
targets
mentioned
above
serve
as
potential
strategies
for
the
development
of
live
attenuated
sars-cov-2
vaccine.compared
with
sars
and
mers
,
which
tended
to
resolve
spontaneously
after
regional
outbreak
,
the
worldwide
magnitude
of
the
covid-19
pandemic
has
made
development
of
vaccine
an
unprecedented
urgency
.
this
urgent
need
has
led
to
many
different
approaches
in
vaccine
development
considerations
.
first
of
all
,
unconventional
vaccine
platforms
,
such
as
nucleic
acid
vaccines
and
viral
vector
vaccines
,
are
becoming
the
leading
players
in
the
race
of
covid-19
vaccine
development
due
to
their
ability
to
be
developed
using
sequence
information
alone
[
122
]
.
these
new
platforms
are
therefore
highly
adaptable
to
emerging
pathogens
,
and
their
safety
profiles
have
already
been
well
examined
in
recent
influenza
,
ebola
and
zika
outbreaks
[
57
]
.
secondly
,
the
clinical
development
process
of
covid-19
vaccine
has
been
accelerated
by
executing
trials
in
parallel
rather
than
following
a
linear
sequence
of
steps
.
for
example
,
multiple
covid-19
vaccine
candidates
directly
entered
clinical
trials
before
having
preclinical
data
in
animal
models
,
and
many
vaccine
trials
have
adopted
an
integrated
phase
i/ii
or
phase
ii/iii
approach
to
save
time

governments
from
the
united
states
and
several
other
countries

.in
this
section
,
we
will
discuss
the
latest
preclinical
and
clinical
development
of
covid-19
vaccines
(
as
of
oct
26
,
2020
)
.
we
will
highlight
representative
covid-19
vaccines
from
each
major
vaccine
platform
that
have
published
clinical
data
(
table
2
)
.up
to
now
,
there
have
been
13
sars-cov-2
protein
subunit
vaccines
entering
clinical
trials
[
130
]
.
among
these
vaccines
,
a
leading
company
novavax
,
with
its
nvx-cov2373
vaccine
,
has
entered
a
phase
iib
trial
in
south
africa
(
nct04533399
)
and
a
phase
iii
trial
in
the
uk
(
2020-004123-16
)
.
nvx-cov2373
contains
a
prefusion
stabilized
full-length
spike
protein
adjuvanted
with
their
proprietary
saponin-based
adjuvant
[
131
,
132
]
.
in
a
preclinical
trial
,
the
vaccine
induced
neutralizing
antibodies
and
prevented
viral
replication
in
the
respiratory
tract
in
macaques
challenged
with
the
virus
[
131
]
.
the
vaccine
also
induced
binding
and
neutralizing
antibodies
in
all
participants
in
the
phase
i
trial
[
132
]
.
in
their
phase
i
trial
,
they
also
observed
a
dose
sparing
effect
by
the
adjuvant
.
they
found
that
both
adjuvanted
5
ug
and
25
ug
dose
regimens
induced
significantly
high
titers
of
neutralizing
antibody
compared
to
the
placebo
group
and
the
25
ug
dose
without
adjuvant
group
[
132
]
.
another
vaccine
that
has
entered
the
phase
ii
trial
is
anhui
zhifei
longcom
’
s
recombinant
new
coronavirus
vaccine
(
nct04466085
)
.
instead
of
using
the
full-length
s
protein
,
anhui
zhifei
longcom
’
s
vaccine
only
contains
the
rbd
of
the
sars-cov-2
s
protein
.
however
,
no
further
design
or
data
has
been
provided
so
far
.
for
the
other
candidate
sars-cov-2
protein
subunit
vaccines
,
most
of
them
also
utilize
either
full-length
s
protein
or
the
rbd
of
s
protein
as
their
vaccine
antigen
.
notably
,
one
recent
study
has
described
a
generalizable
strategy
to
enhance
the
immunogenicity
of
protein
subunit
coronavirus
vaccines
[
133
]
.
they
identified
a
disulfide-linked
dimeric
form
of
mers-rbd
that
is
significantly
more
immunogenic
and
protective
than
its
conventional
monomeric
counterpart
[
133
]
.
they
applied
the
same
strategy
to
sars-cov-2
and
has
demonstrated
a
10–100-fold
enhancement
of
neutralizing
antibody
titers
[
133
]
.
therefore
,
this
framework
of
immunogen
design
could
be
universally
applicable
to
all
protein
subunit
coronavirus
vaccines
in
the
future.there
are
4
dna
vaccines
for
sars-cov-2
currently
under
clinical
trials
[
130
]
.
among
these
developers
,
inovio
is
a
leading
company
that
has
published
results
on
mers-cov
and
sars-cov-2
dna
vaccines
.
inovio
’
s
sars-cov-2
dna
vaccine
ino-4800
encodes
the
full
length
s
protein
and
is
administered
intradermally
with
a
hand-held
device
cellectra
to
electroporate
the
skin
cell
[
70
,
134
]
.
having
experience
in
the
phase
i/iia
trial
of
their
mers
vaccine
(
ino-4700
)
,
they
are
using
the
same
platform
for
the
sars-cov-2
vaccine
ino-4800
[
69
,
70
]
.
they
have
demonstrated
that
the
vaccine
induces
neutralizing
antibodies
and
th1-skewed
immune
responses
in
animal
models
including
mice
,
guinea
pigs
,
and
rhesus
macaques
[
70
,
135
]
.
the
vaccine
is
now
in
two
phase
i/ii
trial
(
nct04447781
and
nct04336410
)
.
the
interim
analysis
of
the
two
phase
i
trials
showed
it
induced
humoral
and
t
cell
immune
responses
in
94
%
participants
after
two
doses
while
only
caused
adverse
events
of
grade
1
or
below
[
136
]
.although
there
were
no
rna
vaccine
studies
for
sars-cov
or
mers-cov
in
the
past
two
decades
,
there
have
already
been
6
novel
rna
vaccines
reaching
clinical
trials
for
sars-cov-2
since
the
outbreak
of
covid-19
[
130
]
.
rna
vaccines
consist
of
viral
antigen-encoding
messenger
rnas
that
can
be
translated
by
human
cells
to
produce
antigenic
proteins
and
stimulate
the
immune
system
.
rna
vaccines
are
usually
delivered
in
complex
with
additional
agents
,
such
as
protamine
or
lipid-
and
polymer-based
nanoparticles
,
to
increase
its
efficacy
[
137
]
.
similar
to
dna
vaccines
,
rna
vaccines
have
the
advantages
of
being
highly
adaptable
to
new
pathogens
and
being
able
to
recapitulate
the
native
conformation
and
modifications
of
antigenic
proteins
.
furthermore
,
compared
with
dna
vaccines
,
rna
vaccines
have
some
additional
benefits
.
unlike
dna
,
rna
does
not
interact
with
host-cell
dna
and
therefore
obviate
the
risks
of
genomic
integration
.
besides
,
rna
vaccines
can
be
given
through
multiple
routes
including
traditional
intravenous
injection
,
whereas
dna
vaccines
need
to
be
administered
via
special
devices
like
electroporation
or
gene
gun
.
nevertheless
,
rna
vaccines
do
have
some
drawbacks
.
exogenous
rna
can
activate
interferon-mediated
antiviral
immune
response
and
lead
to
stalled
translation
and
mrna
degradation
,
which
suppress
the
efficacy
of
rna
vaccines
[
138
]
.
in
addition
,
interferon
signaling
is
associated
with
inflammation
and
potential
autoimmunity
[
139
]
.
even
though
there
have
not
been
severe
cases
of
rna
vaccine-induced
autoimmune
diseases
,
it
is
important
to
carefully
evaluate
this
potential
adverse
effect.moderna
and
biontech/pfizer
are
the
two
leading
developers
for
a
sars-cov-2
rna
vaccine
.
moderna
's
mrna-1273
vaccine
encodes
a
stabilized
prefusion
spike
trimer
,
in
which
they
substituted
the
amino
acids
at
986
and
987
with
proline
to
stabilize
the
spike
protein
in
its
prefusion
conformation
[
140
]
.
the
nucleotides
of
the
mrna
were
also
modified
not
only
to
increase
its
translation
and
half-life
but
also
to
prevent
activation
of
interferon-associated
genes
upon
entering
the
cell
[
140
]
.
the
preliminary
report
for
their
phase
i
clinical
trial
showed
that
:
(
1
)
neutralizing
antibodies
were
detected
in
all
45
patients
after
two
doses
of
immunization
;
(
2
)
antibody
titers
of
immunized
patients
were
higher
than
convalescent
serum
after
two
doses
of
vaccination
;
(
3
)
th1-biased
immune
responses
were
observed
in
immunized
patients
[
140
]
.
there
were
some
cases
of
systemic
adverse
events
after
the
second
dose
of
vaccination
,
but
no
grade
4
adverse
events
were
observed
[
140
]
.
they
concluded
that
100
ug
can
induce
a
satisfactory
immune
response
and
thus
will
continue
to
use
100
ug
dosage
in
phase
iii
clinical
trial
(
nct04470427
)
[
140
]
.
in
addition
,
they
also
expanded
the
same
phase
i
trial
to
include
40
elderly
participants
with
their
age
older
than
55
years
old
[
141
]
.
their
result
demonstrated
that
100
ug
dose
of
mrna-1273
induced
higher
binding-
and
neutralizing-antibody
titers
than
the
25
ug
dose
,
and
the
adverse
events
associated
with
mrna-1273
were
mild
or
moderate
in
these
elderly
participants
[
141
]
.
on
nov
16
,
2020
,
moderna
revealed
the
first
interim
analysis
of
their
phase
iii
trial
(
nct04470427
)
[
142
]
.
their
result
showed
that
among
95
people
who
developed
symptomatic
covid-19
after
volunteering
in
this
trial
,
only
5
of
them
were
from
the
mrna-1273
group
,
and
the
rest
90
cases
were
from
the
placebo
group
,
resulting
in
a
estimated
vaccine
efficacy
of
94.5
%
[
142
]
.
in
addition
,
there
were
11
volunteers
who
developed
severe
covid-19
symptoms
,
and
their
analysis
showed
that
all
11
cases
were
in
the
placebo
group
and
none
in
the
mrna-1273
group
[
142
]
.
their
concurrent
safety
review
also
did
not
notice
any
significant
safety
concern
[
142
]
.
therefore
,
their
promising
result
suggested
that
the
mrna-1273
vaccine
is
safe
and
effective
in
preventing
symptomatic
covid-19
.

four
candidates

although
the
german

used
different

,
the

agreed
with

and
showed
that

they
also
published
another

comparing
the
vaccination
responses
between
bnt162b1
and
bnt162b2
[

team
has
published
their
phase

results
[

.
they
conducted
two

their

induced
potent

there
were
no

from
the
previous
experience

can
induce

.
even
though
no
serious
adverse
effect
has
been
reported
for

,
it
is
important
for
the
research
community
to
keep
this
in
mind
and
carefully
evaluate
potential
adverse
effects
.
for
all
ongoing
trials
of
whole

,
three
of
them
have
publicly
reported
their

.
following

.
in
addition
,
sinopharm
inc.
and
wuhan
institute
of
biological

have
developed
a
different
covid-19
inactivated
virus
vaccine
(
no
specific

)
.
in
this
vaccine
,
wiv04

was
isolated
from

,
propagated
in
vero

,
and
followed
by
two
rounds
of
beta-propiolactone

.
they
tested
three
different

and
three
different
injection
timelines
in
their
phase
i
and
phase
ii
studies
,
and
their
phase
i/ii
interim
report
showed
that
patients
receiving
different
vaccination
regimen
all
had
demonstrated
neutralizing
antibodies
and
with
only
a
low
rate
of
adverse
reactions
[
154

.
now
they
have
launched
a
phase

clinical
trial
in
united
arab
emirates
(
chictr2000034780
)
and
kuwait
(
chictr2000039000

.
finally
,
sinopharm
inc.
also
collaborated
with
beijing
institute
of
biological
products
to
develop
another
covid-19
inactivated
virus
vaccine
bbibp-corv
[
155
,
156
]
.
the
manufacturing
process
of
bbibp-corv
is
very
similar
to
the
other
vaccine
sinopharm
inc.
produced
,
except
that
bbibp-corv
used
a
different
hb02
strain
rather
than
wiv04
strain
[
155
]
.
they
have
tested
bbibp-corv
in
preclinical
models
and
showed
that
two-dose
immunization
of
bbibp-corv
can
protect
rhesus
macaques
from
sars-cov-2
challenge
[
155
]
.
following
this
,
they
completed
a
clinical
phase
i/ii
trial
with
bbibp-corv
and
demonstrated
that
bbibp-corv
is
safe
and
well-tolerated
in
all
tested
doses
in
two
age
groups
[
156
]
.
furthermore
,
their
immunogenicity
result
showed
that
humoral
responses
against
sars-cov-2
were
induced
in
all
vaccine
recipients
42
days
after
immunization
[
156
]
.
now
this
vaccine
is
under
phase
iii
clinical
trial
in
united
arab
emirates
(
chictr2000034780
)
and
argentina
(
nct04560881
)
.there
are
also
several
other
covid-19
vaccine
candidates
using
different
technologies
other
than
the
platforms
mentioned
above
.
virus-like
particle-based
vaccine
,
which
has
been
demonstrated
to
induce
humoral
and
cell-mediated

,
has
one

however
,
none
of
the

has
publicly
reported
their

,
which
has
been
shown
to
provide
protective
effect
in
sars-cov
and
mers-cov
challenged
mice
,
has
3
preclinical
ongoing
studies
[
130
]
.
the
higher
risk
of
adverse
effect
has
made
live
attenuated
vaccine
a
less
appealing
choice
for
the
time-sensitive
race
of
covid-19
vaccine
development
.
nevertheless
,
if
successfully
developed
,
live
attenuated
vaccine
can
provide
the
most
potent
protective
effect
due
to
its
high
similarity
to
natural
infection.in
addition
to
these
traditional
platforms
,
scientists
have
also
developed
covid-19
vaccines
using
unconventional
approaches
.
aivita
biomedical
,
inc.
has
developed
av-covid-19
,
which
is
an
autologous
dendritic
cells
vaccine
loaded
with
sars-cov-2
antigens
[
157
]
.
av-covid-19
is
derived
from
patients
’
own
peripheral
blood
monocytes
,
then
differentiated
in

into
dendritic
cells
,
and
incubated
with
sars-cov-2
antigens
before
injecting
back
into
patients
’
blood
[
157
]
.
now
the
company
has
launched
a
phase
i/ii
clinical
trial
to
evaluate
its
safety
and
efficacy
profile
in
adults
(
nct04386252
)
.
besides
,
symvivo
corporation
has
developed
bactrl-spike
,
a
live
bifidobacterium
vaccine
engineered
to
deliver
synthetic
plasmid
dna
encoding
spike
protein
from
sars-cov-2
.
they
have
also
registered
a
phase
i
clinical
trial
to
examine
the
safety
of
this
vaccine
(
nct04334980
)
.
moreover
,
a
group
from
nanjing
university
has
found
that
a
plant
microrna
,
mir2911
,
can
target
sars-cov-2
by
binding
to
their
mrna
and
blocking
protein
translation
[
158
]
.
their
data
showed
that
mir2911
inhibited
sars-cov-2
replication
and
accelerated
negative
conversion
of
infected
patients
[
158
]
.
following
their
study
,
they
are
now
launching
a
phase
i
clinical
trial
(
chictr2000031432
)
in
china
to
evaluate
the
safety
and
tolerance
of
mir2911
in
patients.finally
,
people
have
been
testing
existing
licensed
vaccines
and
trying
to
repurpose
them
to
combat
covid-19
.
it
has
been
shown
that
tuberculosis
vaccine
bacillus
calmette–guérin
(
bcg
)
can
train
innate
immunity
and
induce
nonspecific
host
defensive
reaction
against
viral
pathogens
,
including
respiratory
syncytial
virus
(
rsv
)
,
influenza
a
virus
and
herpes
simplex
virus
type
2
(
hsv2
)
[
159,160,161,162
]
.
additionally
,
an
interesting
study
compared
the
national
difference
in
covid-19
impact
and
correlated
it
with
national
bcg
vaccination
policy
[
163
]
.
they
found
that
countries
without
universal
policies
of
bcg
vaccination
have
been
more
severely
affected
compared
to
countries
with
universal
and
long-standing
bcg
policies
[
163
]
.
based
on
these
rationales
,
there
have
been
at
least
13
phase
iii
clinical
trials
testing
whether
bcg
vaccine
can
reduce
the
morbidity
and
mortality
of
healthcare
workers
(
nct04328441

,
nct04414267
)
.given
the
rapid
transmission
and
asymptomatic
spread
of
covid-19
,
it
is
clear
that
an
effective
vaccine
with
global
immunization
coverage
is
required
to
bring
people
’
s
lives
back
to
normalcy
.
however
,
even
when
an
effective
sars-cov-2
vaccine
becomes
available
,
the
duration
of
vaccine-induced
immunity
is
still
largely
unknown
.
previous
sars
studies
have
shown
that
sars-specific
igg
and
neutralizing
antibodies
were
only
maintained
for
approximately
2
years
in
patients
who
recovered
from
sars-cov
infection
[
164
,
165
]
.
as
a
result
,
permanent
immunity
is
less
likely
to
be
the
case
for
covid-19
vaccines
,
and
a
regular
vaccination
policy
might
be
required
in
the
future
.
in
addition
,
it
is
still
unclear
what
is
the
minimal
neutralizing
antibody
titer
that
can
provide
protective
effect
against
sars-cov-2
infection
.
it
is
believed
that
the
higher
neutralizing
antibody
vaccination
induces
,
the
better
protective
effect
it
will
be
.
this
is
consistent
with
the
observation
that
most
covid-19
reinfection
cases
only
experience
mild
or
no
symptom
during
their
first
infection
,
which
might
not
be
sufficient
to
induce
strong
neutralizing
antibodies
[
166
,
167
]
.
therefore
,
it
is
of
great
importance
that
further
studies
characterize
the
correlation
between
neutralizing
antibody
and
protective
effect
to
guide
covid-19
vaccine
development
.
last
but
not
least
,
various
mutations
have
been
detected
in
the
sars-cov-2
genome
,
with
d614g
mutation
being
the
most
prevalent
one
[
168
]
.
d614g
is
a
missense
point
mutation
in
s
protein
that
increases
the
infectivity
of
sars-cov-2
by
decreasing
s1
shedding
and
increasing
s
protein
incorporation
into
virion
[
169
,
170
]
.
fortunately
,
d614g
mutation
does
not
prevent
neutralizing
antibodies
from
binding
to
sars-cov-2
and
thus
does
not
provide
resistance
to
vaccination
[
170
]
.
however
,
it
is
possible
that
such
immune-escaping
mutations
appears
in
the
future
and
makes
covid-19
vaccine
development
even
more
difficult.since
the
discovery
of
human
coronaviruses
in
1960s
,
new
types
of
coronaviruses
have
kept
emerging
and
have
gradually
become
a
serious
threat
to
global
public
health
.
even
though
there
have
been
almost
two
decades
since
the
first
coronavirus
outbreak
,
the
scientific
and
medical
community
are
not
well
prepared
with
effective
weapons
to
combat
these
pathogens
.
one
lesson
we
learned
from
this
is
that
the
financial
and
regulatory
mechanism
of
current
pharmaceutical
market
does
not
provide
enough
incentive
to
encourage
vaccine
development
before
a
deadly
outbreak
happens
.
to
make
up
for
this
,
now
academic
institutions
and
companies
all
over
the
world
are
developing
an
explosive
numbers
of
vaccine
candidates
with
highly
compressed
clinical
trial
schedules
.
fortunately
,
the
biological
and
clinical
lessons
we
learned
from
sars-cov
and
mers-cov
researches
,
together
with
the
vaccine
development
experience
we
gained
from
other
diseases
,
have
already
guided
us
to
come
up
with
multiple
promising
candidate
solutions
.
besides
,
multiple
therapeutic
candidates
targeting
molecules
in
sars-cov-2
life
cycle
and
human
immune
response
against
covid-19
have
also
been
rapidly
explored
,
with
remdesivir
and
dexamethasone
being
the
two
leading
drugs
that
showed
promising
clinical
evidences
in
shortening
the
time
to
recovery
and
decreasing
mortality
rates
[
171
,
172
]
.
these
treatment
options
can
be
complementary
to
sars-cov-2
vaccines
to
achieve
overall
mitigation
of
the
covid-19
pandemic
.
in
conclusion
,
we
hope
countries
all
over
the
world
,
regardless
of
political
ideologies
,
can
unite
and
work
together
to
achieve
fast
and
successful
covid-19

begins
with
identifying

cdc
has
expanded
how
it
defines
close
contacts
of
someone
with
covid-19
.
until
this
point
,
the
cdc
had
defined
a
close

as
someone
who
spent
15
or
more
consecutive
minutes
within
six
feet
of
someone
with
covid-19
.
according
to
the
new
definition
,
a
close
contact
is
someone
who
spends
15
minutes
or
more
within
six
feet
of
a
person
with
covid-19
over
a
period
of
24
hours.close

are
at
increased
risk
of

when
a
person
tests
positive
for
covid-19
,
contact
tracers
may
identify
their
close
contacts
and
urge
them
to
quarantine
to
prevent
further
spread
.
based
on
the
new
definition
,
more
people
will
now
be
considered
close
contacts.many
factors
can
affect
the
chances
that
infection
will
spread
from
one
person
to
another
.
these
factors
include
whether

both
people
are
wearing

,
whether
the

is
coughing

showing
other
symptoms
,
and
whether
the
encounter
occurred
indoors

outdoors
.
though
the
``
15
minutes

is
a
helpful
guideline
,
it
's
always
best
to
minimize

masks
help

is
why
the

has
long
advised

in

,
the

revised
their

tailoring
their

depending
on
a

's
vaccination
status
,
along
with
the
nature
and
location
of
the
activity
.
there
are
a
couple
of
reasons
for
this
.
first
,
we
've
learned
that
transmission
is
much
less
likely
to
occur
outdoors
,
where
air
currents
are
more
likely
to
scatter
and
dilute
the
virus
.
in
addition
,
more
and
more
people
have
been
vaccinated
.
those
who
are
vaccinated
are
not
only
protecting
themselves
from
infection
,
they
also
appear
less
likely
to
infect
others
.
according
to
the
new
cdc
guidance
,
fully
vaccinated
people
can
now
participate
in
all
indoor
and
outdoor
activities
without
a
mask
and
without
physical
distancing
.
for
people
who
are
not
fully
vaccinated
,
the
cdc
continues
to
recommend
mask
wearing
and
other
preventive
measures
in
some
outdoors
settings
and
in
most
indoor
settings.the
cdc
has
created
a
helpful
chart
illustrating
the
protection
vaccination
provides
in
all
outdoor
and

and
what
prevention
measures
you
still
need

take
if

kind
of
mask
should
you
wear
?
the
cdc
recommends
masks
made
of
two
or
more
layers
of
washable
,
breathable
fabric
.
surgical
masks
are
also
effective
.
make
sure
the
mask
completely
covers
your
nose
and
mouth
and
fits
snugly
against
the
sides
of
your
face
without
leaving
any
gaps.while
n95
masks
are
the
most
effective
,
these
medical-grade
masks
should
be
reserved
for
healthcare
workers.surgical
masks
are
preferred
if
you
are
caring
for

,
double

is
still
a
good
idea
.

observed
masked
and
unmasked
dummies
that
released
aerosol
particles
from
a

were
simulated
to
cough

the
study
found
that
wearing
a
multilayered
cloth
mask
over
a
surgical
mask
or
wearing
a
tightly
fitted
surgical
mask
substantially
increased
the
level
of

've
known
for

time
that

help
prevent

from
spreading
the

to

.
based

a

contends

wearers
from

themselves.different

if

,
then
fewer
people
may
become

,
and
those

do
may

in

experimented
with

to
test
the

of

they
put

similar
experiment
can
not
ethically
be
done

researchers
have
studied

found
that
people
who
inhaled

.
observations
of

also
support
the
idea
that

may
help
protect

wearers.without

,
we
ca
n't
be
certain
that

protect
the

we
do
know
they

and
that
they
protect

to
a
study
published
in

medicine
,
widespread
use
of

could
prevent
nearly
130,000
of
500,000
covid-related
deaths
estimated
to
occur
by
march
2021.these
numbers
are
based

the

considered

the

infection
,
how
many
get
exposed
,
how
many
then
become

infectious
)
,
and
how
many
recover
.
they
then
modeled
various
scenarios
,
including
mask
wearing
,
assuming
that
social
distancing
mandates
would
go
into
effect
once
the
number
of
deaths
exceeded
8
per
1
million
people.modeling
studies
are
based
on
assumptions
,
so
the
exact
numbers
are
less
important
than
the
comparisons
of
different
scenarios
.
in
this
study
,
a
scenario
in
which
95
%
of
people
always
wore

resulted
in

first
,
it

second
,
it

both

share
a
key
mutation

)
on

according
to

's
what
we
know
.
covid-19
can
lead
to
serious
illness
and
long-term
complications
,
even
in
younger
people
and
those
without
underlying
medical
conditions
.
we
also
know
that
it
's
possible
for
someone
who
has
already
had
covid-19
to
be
re-infected
,
though
this
is
not
common.on
the
other
hand
,
we
do
n't
know
how
long
natural
immunity
to
covid-19
—
the
protection
that
results
from
having
been
sick
—
lasts
.
it
's
not
clear
if
the
strength
or
duration
of
natural
immunity
varies
based
on
the
severity
of
the
initial
illness
.
we
also
do
n't
know
how
long
immunity
conferred
by
vaccines
lasts.during
the
initial
deployment
of
the
vaccine
to
front
line
workers
and
people
in
long-term
care
facilities
like
nursing
homes
,
people
eligible
for
the
vaccine
will
get
it
regardless
of
whether
or
not
they
were
previously
infected
.
they
are
not
being
tested
for
antibodies
prior
to
vaccination.as
scientists
learn
more
about
natural
immunity
after
covid
illness
,
vaccination
criteria
based
on
the
presence
of
antibodies
may
play
a
role
in
the
future.the
answer
is
,
we
do
n't
know.clinical
trials
of
the
pfizer/biontech
and
moderna
vaccines
found
that
both
do
a
good
job
preventing
symptomatic
covid-19
disease
,
including
severe
covid-19
.
however
,
the
trials
did
not
measure
whether
a
person
who
is
vaccinated
is
less
likely
to
spread
the
virus
to
someone
else.it
's
possible
that
the
vaccines
protect
against
covid-19
disease
by
preventing
a
person
from
becoming
infected
in
the
first
place
.
however
,
it
's
also
possible
that
the
vaccine
protects
a
person
from
covid-19
illness
,
but
does
not
prevent
a
person
from
becoming
infected
.
in
other
words
,
a
vaccinated
person
may
have
replicating
virus
in
their
nose
and
throat
even
if
they
are
protected
from
becoming
sick.but
does
that
mean
that
you
have
enough
virus
in
your
nose
and
throat
to
infect
someone
else
?
not
necessarily
.
it
's
possible
that
the
immune
response
triggered
by
the
vaccine
,
which
protects
you
from
becoming
sick
,
also
reduces
the
amount
of
virus
in
your
nose
and
throat
to
a
point
where
you
are
unlikely
to
spread
it
to
someone
else

but
we
need
more
research
to
know
for

bottom
line
?
if
you
're
among
the
first
groups
of
people
to
get
vaccinated
,
it
's
best
to
continue
wearing
masks

vaccine
will
protect
you
from

,
but
it
may
not

that
's
why
,
at

for
now
,
you
should
continue
wearing
a

agree
that
the
new
mrna
covid-19
vaccines
(
pfizer/biontech
and
moderna
)
should
be
offered
to
pregnant
and
breastfeeding
individuals
.
but
there
is
a
lot
we
still
do
not
know
about
the
safety
of
the
vaccines
in
these
populations
,
and
your
own
doctor
is
in
the
best
to
position
to
advise
you
based
on
your
personal
health
risks
and
preferences.here
are
some
factors
to
consider
.
first
,
although
the
actual
risk
of
severe
covid-19
illness
and
death
among
pregnant
individuals
is
very
low
,
it
is
higher
when
compared
to
nonpregnant
individuals
from
the
same
age
group
.
in
addition
,
research
suggests
that
having
covid-19
might
increase
risk
for
premature
birth
,
particularly
for
those
with
severe
illness
.
transmission
of
the
virus
from
mother
to
baby
during
pregnancy
is
possible
,
but
it
appears
to
be
a
rare
event.mrna
vaccine
trials
did
not
deliberately
include
pregnant
individuals
,
so
our
knowledge
regarding
the
safety
of
mrna
covid-19
vaccines
during
pregnancy
is
limited
.
in
animal
studies
,
mrna
vaccines
did
not
affect
fertility
or
cause
any
problems
with
pregnancy
.
mrna
vaccines
do
not
contain
any
virus
,
so
they
can
not
cause
covid-19
in
a
woman
or
her
baby
.
and
our
bodies
quickly
break
down
and
eliminate
mrna
particles
used
in
the
vaccine
so
they
are
unlikely
to
reach
or
cross
the
placenta
.
on
the
other
hand
,
the
immunity
that
a
woman
generates
from
vaccination
can
cross
the
placenta
,
and
may
help
to
keep
the
baby
safe
after
birth.experts
also
believe
it
is
most
likely
safe
to
get
an
mrna
covid-19
vaccine
if
you
’
re
breastfeeding
,
although
breastfeeding
people
were
not
included
in
the
vaccine
trials
.
when
a
person
gets
vaccinated
while
breastfeeding
,
their
immune
system
develops
antibodies
that
protect
against
covid-19
.
these
antibodies
can
be
passed
through
breast
milk
to
the
baby
and
are
likely
to
help
protect
against
infection.adenoviruses
can
cause
a
variety
of
illnesses
,
including
the
common
cold
.
they
are
being
used
in
two
leading
covid-19
vaccine
candidates
as
capsules
(
the
scientific
term
is
vectors
)
to
deliver
the
coronavirus
spike
protein
into
the
body
.
the
spike
protein
prompts
the
immune
system
to
produce
antibodies
against
it
,
preparing
the
body
to
attack
the
sars-cov-2
virus
if
it
later
infects
the
body.in
december
2020
,
astrazeneca
published
promising
results
of
an
adenovirus-based
vaccine
that
it
developed
with
researchers
at
the
university
of
oxford
.
the
study
was
published
in
the
journal
the

lancet
analysis
of

efficacy
was
based
on
11,636
adult

of
these
,
4,440
participants
received
a
full

,
followed
four
weeks
later
by

nearly
1,400
participants
received
a
half

vaccine
,
followed

.
the
control
group
received
a
meningitis
vaccine
,
followed
by
a
second
meningitis
vaccine
or
a
placebo
(
a
salt
water
shot
)
.
there
were
131
documented
cases
of
covid-19
,
all
of
which
occurred
at
least
two
weeks
after
the
second
shot.the
coronavirus
vaccine
reduced
the
risk
of
covid-19
by
an
average
of
70.4
%
,
compared
to
the
control
group
.
surprisingly
,
the
half
dose/full
dose
vaccine
combination
was
more
effective
,
reducing
risk
of
covid-19
by
90
%
.
the
full
dose
combination
reduced
risk
by
62
%
.
none
of
the
participants
who
received
the
coronavirus
vaccine
developed
severe
covid-19
or
had
to
be
hospitalized
.
there
was
also
a
reduction
in
asymptomatic
cases.most
study
participants
were
between

in

,
the
study
participants
were
healthy

more

is
needed
to
understand
how
effective
this
vaccine
is
in
people
older
than
55
,
people
of
color
,
and
people
with
underlying
medical
conditions

this
vaccine
is
in

this
analysis
was
based
on
data
from
the
united

and
brazil.the

covid-19
has
taken
a
heavy
toll
on
residents
of
long-term
care
facilities
.
frontline
essential
workers
are
those
who
can
not
work
from
home
and
who
may
not
be
able
to
physically
distance
while
working

they
include

,
teachers
and
day
care
workers
,
postal
workers
,
and
people
who
work
in
grocery
stores.the
cdc
's
guidance
is
based
on
a
recommendation
from
the
advisory
committee
on
immunization
practices
(
acip
)
,
made
up
of
experts
in
vaccinology

health
,
and

their
work

;
they
broadly
advise
the
cdc
on

,
there
are
currently
over
70
different

trials
in
humans.in
december
2020
,
the
fda
granted
emergency
use
authorization
(
eua
)
to
two
covid-19
vaccines
,
one
developed
by
pfizer/biontech
and
another
developed
by
moderna
.
these
vaccines
use
a
type
of
molecule
called
messenger
rna
(
mrna
)
that
can
be
mass-manufactured
very
rapidly
.
in
these
vaccines
,
mrna
induces
human
cells
to
make
a
protein
that
looks
just
like
the
spike
protein
that
studs
the
surface
of
the
coronavirus
and
enables
it
to
enter
human
cells
.
the
body
recognizes
the
spike
protein
as
an
invader
,
and
produces
antibodies
against
it
.
if
the
antibodies
later
encounter
the
actual
virus
,
they
are
ready
to
recognize
and
destroy
it
before
it
causes
illness.two
other
vaccine
approaches
are
also
showing
promise.a
central
question
for
covid-19
vaccines
will
be
how
long
protection
might
last.natural
immunity
to
covid-19
is
the
protection
that
results
from
having
been
sick
.
but
we
do
n't
know
how
long
natural
immunity
lasts
,
or
how
strong
it
is
.
so
can
we
count
on
natural
immunity
to
protect
us
from
reinfection
?
if
so
,
for
how
long
?
unfortunately
,
we
do
n't
know
the
answer
to
either
of
those
questions.there
have
been
some
confirmed
cases
of
reinfection
with
covid-19
.
in
other
words
,
a
person
got
sick
with
covid-19
,
recovered
,
and
then
became
infected
again
.
this
is
rare
,
but
it
can
happen.evidence
suggests
that
people
who
have
already
gotten
sick
with
covid-19
benefit
from
the
vaccine
,
possibly
even
more
than
vaccinated
people
who
were
not
previously
infected
.
for
now
,
people
are
eligible
to
get
the
covid-19
vaccine
whether
or
not
they
were
previously
infected
.
vaccination
criteria
may
change
in
the
future
as
scientists
learn
more
about
natural
immunity
after
covid
illness.herd
immunity
occurs
when
enough
people
become
immune
to
a
disease
to
make
its
spread
unlikely
.
as
a
result
,
the
entire
community
is
protected
,
even
those
who
are
not
themselves
immune
.
herd
immunity
is
usually
achieved
through
vaccination
,
but
it
can
also
occur
through
natural
infection.experts
initially
estimated
that
somewhere
between
60
%
and
70
%
of
the
population
needs
to
be
immune
in
order
to
achieve
herd
immunity
.
more
recently
,
they
have
raised
that
estimate
to
near
90
%
.
(
as
of
now
,
we
are
nowhere
close
to
the
numbers
needed
to
achieve
herd
immunity
.
)
achieving
herd
immunity
through
natural
infection
means
many
people
would
become
ill
and
many
would
die
.
these
risks
may
fall
as
we
develop
effective
treatments
.
however
,
we
still
do
n't
know
how
long
people
who
recover

remain
immune
to
reinfection.ideally
,
we
will
achieve
herd
immunity
as
more
people
around
the
world
receive
vaccines
that
will
confer
lasting
immunity.vaccines
against
pneumonia
,
such
as
pneumococcal
vaccine
and
hemophilus

type
b
(

vaccine
,
only
help
protect
people
from
these
specific
bacterial
infections
.
they
do
not
protect
against
any
coronavirus
pneumonia
,
including
pneumonia
that
may
be
part
of
covid-19
.
however
,
even
though
these
vaccines
do
not
specifically
protect
against
the
coronavirus
that
causes
covid-19
,
they
are
highly
recommended
to
protect
against
other
respiratory
illnesses.at
present
,
it
is
considered
unlikely
that
pets
such
as
dogs
or
cats
can
spread
the
covid-19
virus
to
humans
.
however
,
pets
can
spread
other
infections
that
cause
illness
,
including
e.
coli
and
salmonella
,
so
wash
your
hands
thoroughly
with
soap
and
water
after
interacting
with
pets.the
virus
that
causes
covid-19
does
appear
to
spread
from
people
to
pets
,
according
to
the
fda
.
research
has
found
that
cats
and
ferrets
are
more
likely
to
become
infected
than
dogs.if
you
have
a
pet
,
do
the
following
to
reduce
their
risk
of
infection
:
if
you
become
sick
with
covid-19
,
restrict
contact
with
your
pets
,
just
like
you
would
around
other
people
.
this
means
you
should
forgo
petting
,
snuggling
,
being
kissed
or
licked
,
and
sharing
food
or
bedding
with
your
pet
until
you
are
feeling
better
.
when
possible
,
have
another
member
of
your
household
care
for
your
pets
while
you
are
sick
.
if
you
must
care
for
your
pet
while
you
are
sick
,
wash
your
hands
before
and
after
you
interact
with
your
pets
and
wear
a
face
mask.your
immune
system
is
your
body
's
defense
system
.
when
a
harmful
invader
—
like
a
cold
or
flu
virus
,
or
the
coronavirus
that
causes
covid-19
—
gets
into
your
body
,
your
immune
system
mounts
an
attack
.
known
as
an
immune
response
,
this
attack
is
a
sequence
of
events
that
involves
various
cells
and
unfolds
over
time.following
general
health
guidelines
is
the
best
step
you
can
take
toward
keeping
your
immune
system
strong
and
healthy
.
every
part
of
your
body
,
including
your
immune
system
,
functions
better
when
protected
from
environmental
assaults
and
bolstered
by
healthy-living
strategies
such
as
these
:
many
medical
and
dental
practices
have
instituted
comprehensive
safety
measures
to
help
protect
you
,
the
doctor
and
office
staff
,
and
other
patients
.
if
you
feel
anxious
about
visiting
in
person
,
call
the
practice.many
doctor
's
offices
are
increasingly
providing
telehealth
services
.
this
may
mean
appointments
by
phone
call
,
or
virtual
visits
using
a
video
chat
service
.
ask
to
schedule
a
telehealth
appointment
with
your
doctor
for
a
new
or
ongoing
nonurgent
matter
.
if
,
after
speaking
to
you
,
your
doctor
would
like
to
see
you
in
person
,
he
or
she
will
let
you
know.what
if
your
appointments
are
not
urgent
but
also
do
n't
fall
into
the
low-risk
category
?
for
example
,
if
you
have
been
advised
to
have
periodic
scans
after
cancer
remission
,
if
your
doctor
sees
you
regularly
to
monitor
for
a
condition
for
which
you
're
at
increased
risk
,
or
if
your
treatment
varies
based
on
your
most
recent
test
results
?
in
these
and
similar
cases
,
call
your
doctor
for
advice.the
availability
of
elective
surgeries
and
procedures
throughout
the
united
states
is
very
fluid
,
and
may
reflect
the
number
of
cases
and
infection
rate
in
a
given
area
.
if
covid-19
cases
are
rising
in
your
area
,
it
's
quite
possible
that
you
already
have
been
canceled
or
rescheduled
by
the
hospital
or
medical
center
in
which
you
are
scheduled
to
have
the
procedure
.
if
not
,
you
should
consider
postponing
any
procedure
that
can
wait.that
being
said
,
keep
in
mind
that
``
elective
''
is
a
relative
term
.
for
instance
,
you
may
not
have
needed
immediate
surgery
for
sciatica
caused
by
a
herniated
disc
.
but
the
pain
may
be
so
severe
that
you
would
not
be
able
to
endure
postponing
the
surgery
for
weeks
or
perhaps
months
.
in
that
case
,
you
and
your
doctor
should
make
a
shared
decision
about
proceeding
.
the
new
covid-19
vaccines
from
pfizer
and
moderna
seem
to
be
remarkably
good
at
preventing
serious
illness
.
but
it
’
s
unclear
how
well
they
will
curb
the
spread
of
the
coronavirus.that
’
s
because
the
pfizer
and
moderna
trials
tracked
only
how
many
vaccinated
people
became
sick
with
covid-19
.
that
leaves
open
the
possibility
that
some
vaccinated
people
get
infected
without
developing
symptoms
,
and
could
then
silently
transmit
the
virus
—
especially
if
they
come
in
close
contact
with
others
or
stop
wearing
masks.if
vaccinated
people
are
silent
spreaders
of
the
virus
,
they
may
keep
it
circulating
in
their
communities
,
putting
unvaccinated
people
at
risk.
“
a
lot
of
people
are
thinking
that
once
they
get
vaccinated
,
they
’
re
not
going
to
have
to
wear
masks
anymore
,
”
said
michal
tal
,
an
immunologist
at
stanford
university
.
“
it
’
s
really
going
to
be
critical
for
them
to
know
if
they
have
to
keep
wearing
masks
,
because
they
could
still
be
contagious.
”
in
most
respiratory
infections
,
including
the
new
coronavirus
,
the
nose
is
the
main
port
of
entry
.
the
virus
rapidly
multiplies
there
,
jolting
the
immune
system
to
produce
a
type
of
antibodies
that
are
specific
to
mucosa
,
the
moist
tissue
lining
the
nose
,
mouth
,
lungs
and
stomach
.
if
the
same
person
is
exposed
to
the
virus
a
second
time
,
those
antibodies
,
as
well
as
immune
cells
that
remember
the
virus
,
rapidly
shut
down
the
virus
in
the
nose
before
it
gets
a
chance
to
take
hold
elsewhere
in
the
body.the
coronavirus
vaccines
,
in
contrast
,
are
injected
deep
into
the
muscles
and
stimulate
the
immune
system
to
produce
antibodies
.
this
appears
to
be
enough
protection
to
keep
the
vaccinated
person
from
getting
ill.some
of
those
antibodies
will
circulate
in
the
blood
to
the
nasal
mucosa
and
stand
guard
there
,
but
it
’
s
not
clear
how
much
of
the
antibody
pool
can
be
mobilized
,
or
how
quickly
.
if
the
answer
is
not
much
,
then
viruses
could
bloom
in
the
nose
—
and
be
sneezed
or
breathed
out
to
infect
others.
“
it
’
s
a
race
:
it
depends
whether
the
virus
can
replicate
faster
,
or
the
immune
system
can
control
it
faster
,
”
said
marion
pepper
,
an
immunologist
at
the
university
of
washington
in
seattle
.
“
it
’
s
a
really
important
question.
”
this
is
why
mucosal
vaccines
,
like
the
nasal
spray
flumist
or
the
oral
polio
vaccine
,
are
better
than
intramuscular
injections
at
fending
off
respiratory
viruses
,
experts
said.the
next
generation
of
coronavirus
vaccines
may
elicit
immunity
in
the
nose
and
the
rest
of
the
respiratory
tract
,
where
it
’
s
most
needed
.
or
people
could
get
an
intramuscular
injection
followed
by
a
mucosal
boost
that
produces
protective
antibodies
in
the
nose
and
throat.the
coronavirus
vaccines
have
proved
to
be
powerful
shields
against
severe
illness
,
but
that
is
no
guarantee
of
their
efficacy
in
the
nose
.
the
lungs
—
the
site
of
severe
symptoms
—
are
much
more
accessible
to
the
circulating
antibodies
than
the
nose
or
throat
,
making
them
easier
to
safeguard.
“
preventing
severe
disease
is
easiest
,
preventing
mild
disease
is
harder
,
and
preventing
all
infections
is
the
hardest
,
”
said
deepta
bhattacharya
,
an
immunologist
at
the
university
of
arizona
.
“
if
it
’
s
95
percent
effective
at
preventing
symptomatic
disease
,
it
’
s
going
to
be
something
less
than
that
in
preventing
all
infections
,
for
sure.
”
still
,
he
and
other
experts
said
they
were
optimistic
that
the
vaccines
would
suppress
the
virus
enough
even
in
the
nose
and
throat
to
prevent
immunized
people
from
spreading
it
to
others.
“
my
feeling
is
that
once
you
develop
some
form
of
immunity
with
the
vaccine
,
your
ability
to
get
infected
will
also
go
down
,
”
said
akiko
iwasaki
,
an
immunologist
at
yale
university
.
“
even
if
you
’
re
infected
,
the
level
of
virus
that
you
replicate
in
your
nose
should
be
reduced.
”
the
vaccine
trials
have
not
produced
data
on
how
many
vaccinated
people
were
infected
with
the
virus
but
did
not
have
symptoms
.
some
hints
are
emerging
,
however.astrazeneca
,
which
announced
some
of
its
trial
results
in
november
,
said
that
volunteers
had
been
testing
themselves
regularly
for
the
virus
,
and
that
those
results
suggested
that
the
vaccine
might
prevent
some
infections.pfizer
will
test
a
subset
of
its
trial
participants
for
antibodies
against
a
viral
protein
called
n.
because
the
vaccines
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
protein
,
n
antibodies
would
reveal
whether
the
volunteers
had
become
infected
with
the
virus
after
immunization
,
said
jerica
pitts
,
a
spokeswoman
for
the
company.moderna

plans
to
analyze

those
results

”
said
colleen
hussey
,
a
spokeswoman
for
moderna.the
trials
have
so
far
analyzed
only
blood
,
but
testing
for
antibodies
in

would
confirm
that
the
antibodies
can
travel
to
the
nose
and

.
dr.

to
analyze

samples

johnson
trial
to
see
how
the
two
antibody
levels
compare.in
the
meantime
,
dr.
bhattacharya
said
,
he
was
encouraged
by
recent
work
showing
that
people
who
received
an
intramuscular
flu
vaccine
had
abundant
antibodies
in
the
nose
.
and
a
study
of
covid-19
patients
found
that
antibody
levels
in
saliva
and
blood
were
closely
matched
—
suggesting
that
a
strong
immune
response
in
the
blood
would
also
protect
mucosal
tissues.only
people
who
have
virus
teeming
in
their
nose
and
throat
would
be
expected
to
transmit
the
virus
,
and
the
lack
of
symptoms
in
the
immunized
people
who
became
infected
suggests
that
the
vaccine
may
have
kept
the
virus
levels
in
check.but
some
studies
have
suggested
that
even
people
with
no
symptoms
can
have
high
amounts

said

was
concerned
by
monkey
studies
showing
that
some
vaccinated
animals
did
not
get
ill

still
had
virus
in

nose.but
those
monkeys
were
intentionally
exposed

animals
,

,
a

at

in

“
the
more
you
reduce

load
,
the
less
likely
you
are
to
be
transmissible
,
”
dr.
moore
said
.
but
“
all
of
these
are
things
where
data
trumps
theory

and
we
need
the
data.
”
at
what
point
does
a
country
achieve
herd
immunity
?
what
portion
of
the
population
must
acquire
resistance
to
the
coronavirus
,
either
through
infection
or
vaccination
,
in
order
for
the
disease
to
fade
away
and
life
to
return
to
normal
?
since
the
start
of
the
pandemic
,
the
figure
that
many
epidemiologists
have
offered
has
been
60
to
70
percent
.
that
range
is
still
cited
by
the
world
health
organization
and
is
often
repeated
during
discussions
of
the
future
course
of
the
disease.although
it
is
impossible
to
know
with
certainty
what
the
limit
will
be
until
we
reach
it
and
transmission
stops
,
having
a
good
estimate
is
important
:
it
gives
americans
a
sense
of
when
we
can
hope
to
breathe
freely
again.recently
,
a
figure
to
whom
millions
of
americans
look
for
guidance
—
dr.
anthony
s.
fauci
,
an
adviser
to
both
the
trump
administration
and
the
incoming
biden
administration
—
has
begun
incrementally
raising
his
herd-immunity
estimate.in
the
pandemic
’
s
early
days
,
dr.
fauci
tended
to
cite
the
same
60
to
70
percent
estimate
that
most
experts
did
.
about
a
month
ago
,
he
began
saying
“
70
,
75
percent
”
in
television
interviews
.
and
last
week
,
in
an
interview
with
cnbc
news
,
he
said
“
75
,
80
,
85
percent
”
and
“
75
to
80-plus
percent.
”
in
a
telephone
interview
the
next
day
,
dr.
fauci
acknowledged
that
he
had
slowly
but
deliberately
been
moving
the
goal
posts
.
he
is
doing
so
,
he
said
,
partly
based
on
new
science
,
and
partly
on
his
gut
feeling
that
the
country
is
finally
ready
to
hear
what
he
really
thinks.hard
as
it
may
be
to
hear
,
he
said
,
he
believes
that
it
may
take
close
to
90
percent
immunity
to
bring
the
virus
to
a
halt
—
almost
as
much
as
is
needed
to
stop
a
measles
outbreak.asked
about
dr.
fauci
’
s
conclusions
,
prominent
epidemiologists
said
that
he
might
be
proven
right
.
the
early
range
of
60
to
70
percent
was
almost
undoubtedly
too
low
,
they
said
,
and
the
virus
is
becoming
more
transmissible
,
so
it
will
take
greater
herd
immunity
to
stop
it.dr
.
fauci
said
that
weeks
ago
,
he
had
hesitated
to
publicly
raise
his
estimate
because
many
americans
seemed
hesitant
about
vaccines
,
which
they
would
need
to
accept
almost
universally
in
order
for
the
country
to
achieve
herd
immunity.now
that
some
polls
are
showing
that
many
more
americans
are
ready
,
even
eager
,
for
vaccines
,
he
said
he
felt
he
could
deliver
the
tough
message
that
the
return
to
normal
might
take
longer
than
anticipated.
“
when
polls
said
only
about
half
of
all
americans
would
take
a
vaccine
,
i
was
saying
herd
immunity
would
take
70
to
75
percent
,
”
dr.
fauci
said
.
“
then
,
when
newer
surveys
said
60
percent
or
more
would
take
it
,
i
thought
,
‘
i
can
nudge
this
up
a
bit
,
’
so
i
went
to
80
,
85.
”
“
we
need
to
have
some
humility
here
,
”
he
added
.
“
we
really
don
’
t
know
what
the
real
number
is
.
i
think
the
real
range
is
somewhere
between
70
to
90
percent
.
but
,
i
’
m
not
going
to
say
90
percent.
”
doing
so
might
be
discouraging
to
americans
,
he
said
,
because
he
is
not
sure
there
will
be
enough
voluntary
acceptance
of
vaccines
to
reach
that
goal
.
although
sentiments
about
vaccines
in
polls
have
bounced
up
and
down
this
year
,
several
current
ones
suggest
that
about
20
percent
of
americans
say
they
are
unwilling
to
accept
any
vaccine.also
,
dr.
fauci
noted
,
a
herd-immunity
figure
at
90
percent
or
above
is
in
the
range
of
the
infectiousness
of
measles.
“
i
’
d
bet
my

in

military
barracks
and
student
dormitories
,
it
has
kept
transmitting
until
more
than
95
percent
of
all
residents
are
infected.interviews
with
epidemiologists
regarding
the
degree
of
herd
immunity
needed
to
defeat
the
coronavirus
produced
a
range
of
estimates
,
some
of
which
were
in
line
with
dr.
fauci
’
s
.
they
also
came
with
a
warning
:
all
answers
are
merely
“
guesstimates.
”
“
you
tell
me
what
numbers
to
put
in
my
equations
,
and
i

give

”
said

school
of
public
health
.
“
but
you
can
’
t
tell
me
the
numbers
,
because
nobody
knows
them.
”
the
only
truly
accurate
measures
of
herd
immunity
are
done
in
actual
herds
and
come
from
studying
animal
viruses
like
rinderpest
and
foot-and-mouth
disease
,
said
dr.
david
m.
morens
,
dr.
fauci
’
s
senior
adviser
on
epidemiology
at
the
national
institute
of
allergy
and
infectious
diseases.when
cattle
are
penned
in
corrals
,
it
is
easy
to
measure
how
fast
a
disease
spreads
from
one
animal
to
another
,
he
said
.
humans
move
around
,
so
studying
disease
spread
among
them
is
far
harder.the
original
assumption
that
it
would
take
60
to
70
percent
immunity
to
stop
the
disease
was
based
on
early
data
from
china
and
italy
,
health
experts
noted.epidemiologists
watching
how
fast
cases
doubled
in
those
outbreaks
calculated
that
the
virus
’
s
reproduction
number
,
or
r0
—
how
many
new
victims
each
carrier
infected
—
was
about
3
.
so
two
out
of
three
potential
victims
would
have
to
become
immune
before
each
carrier
infected
fewer
than
one
.
when
each
carrier
infects
fewer
than
one
new
victim
,
the
outbreak
slowly
dies
out.two
out
of
three
is
66.7
percent
,
which
established
the
range
of
60
to
70
percent
for
herd
immunity.reinforcing
that
notion
was
a
study
conducted
by
the
french
military
on
the
crew
of
the
aircraft
carrier
charles
de
gaulle
,
which
had
an
outbreak
in
late
march
,
said
dr.
christopher
j.l
.
murray
,
director
of
the
university
of
washington
’
s
institute
for
health
metrics
and
evaluation.the
study
found
that
1,064
of
the
1,568
sailors
aboard
,
or
about
68
percent
,
had
tested
positive
for
the
virus.but
the
carrier
returned
to
port
while
the
outbreak
was
still
in
progress
,
and
the
crew
went
into
quarantine
,
so
it
was
unclear
whether
the
virus
was
finished
infecting
new
sailors
even
after
68
percent
had
caught
it.also
,
outbreaks
aboard
ships
are
poor
models
for
those
on
land
because
infections
move
much
faster
in
the
close
quarters
of
a
vessel
than
in
a
free-roaming
civilian
population
,
said
dr.
natalie
e.
dean
,
a
biostatistician
at
the
university
of
florida.more
important
,
the
early
estimates
from
wuhan
and
italy
were
later
revised
upward
,
dr.
lipsitch
noted
,
once
chinese
scientists
realized
they
had
undercounted
the
number
of
victims
of
the
first
wave
.
it
took
about
two
months
to
be
certain
that
there
were
many
asymptomatic
people
who
had
also
spread
the
virus.it
also
became
clearer
later
that
“
superspreader
events
,
”
in
which
one
person
infects
dozens
or
even
hundreds
of
others
,
played
a
large
role
in
spreading
covid-19
.
such
events
,
in
“
normal
”
populations
—
in
which
no
one
wears
masks
and
everyone
attends
events
like
parties
,
basketball
tournaments
or
broadway
shows
—
can
push
the
reproduction
number
upward
to
4
,
5
or
even
6
,
experts
said
.
consequently
,
those
scenarios
call
for
higher
herd
immunity
;
for
example
,
at
an
r0
of
5
,
more
than
four
out
of
five
people
,
or
80
percent
,
must
be
immune
to
slow
down
the
virus.further
complicating
matters
,
there
is
a
growing
consensus
among
scientists
that
the
virus
itself
is
becoming
more
transmissible
.
a
variant
“
italian
strain
”
with
the
mutation
known
as
d614g
has
spread
much
faster
than
the
original
wuhan
variant
.
a
newly
identified
mutation
,
sometimes
called
n501y
,
that
may
make
the
virus
even
more
infectious
has
recently
appeared
in
britain
,
south
africa
and
elsewhere.the
more
transmissible
a
pathogen
,
the
more
people
must
become
immune
in
order
to
stop
it.dr
.
morens
and
dr.
lipsitch
agreed
with
dr.
fauci
that
the
level
of
herd
immunity
needed
to
stop
covid-19
could
be
85
percent
or
higher
.
“
but
that
’
s
a
guesstimate
,
”
dr.
lipsitch
emphasized.
“
tony
’
s
reading
the
tea
leaves
,
”
dr.
morens
said.the
centers
for
disease
control
and
prevention
offers
no
herd
immunity
estimate
,
saying
on
its
website
that
“
experts
do
not
know.
”
although
w.h.o
.
scientists
still
sometimes
cite
the
older
60
to
70
percent
estimate
,
dr.
katherine
o
’
brien
,
the
agency
’
s
director
of
immunization
,
said
that
she
now
thought
that
range
was
too
low
.
she
declined
to
estimate
what
the
correct
higher
one
might
be.
“
we
’
d
be
leaning
against
very
thin
reeds
if
we
tried
to
say
what
level
of
vaccine
coverage
would
be
needed
to
achieve
it
,
”
she
said
.
“
we
should
say
we
just
don
’
t
know
.
and
it
won
’
t
be
a
world
or
even
national
number
.
it
will
depend
on
what
community
you
live
in.
”
dr
.
dean
noted
that
to
stop
transmission
in
a
crowded
city
like
new
york
,
more
people
would
have
to
achieve
immunity
than
would
be
necessary
in
a
less
crowded
place
like
montana.even
if
dr.
fauci
is
right
and
it
will
take
85
or
even
90
percent
herd
immunity
to
completely
stop
coronavirus
transmission
,
dr.
lipsitch
said
,
“
we
can
still
defang
the
virus
sooner
than
that.
”
he
added
:
“
we
don
’
t
have
to
have
zero
transmission
in
order
to
have
a
decent
society
.
we
have
lots
of
diseases
,
like
flu
,
transmitting
all
the
time
,
and
we
don
’
t
shut
down
society
for
that
.
if
we
can
vaccinate
almost
all
the
people
who
are
most
at
risk
of
severe
outcomes
,
then
this
would
become
a
milder
disease.

with
the
coronavirus
pandemic
surging
and
initial
vaccine
supplies
limited
,
the
united
states
faces
a
hard
choice
:
should
the
country
’
s
immunization
program
focus
in
the
early
months
on
the
elderly
and
people
with
serious
medical
conditions
,
who
are
dying
of
the
virus
at
the
highest
rates
,
or
on
essential
workers
,
an
expansive
category
encompassing
americans
who
have
borne
the
greatest
risk
of
infection
?
health
care
workers
and
the
frailest
of
the
elderly
—
residents
of
long-term-care
facilities
—
will
almost
certainly
get
the
first
shots
,
under
guidelines
the
centers
for
disease
control
and
prevention
issued
on
thursday
.
but
with
vaccination
expected
to
start
this
month
,
the
debate
among
federal
and
state
health
officials
about
who
goes
next
,
and
lobbying
from
outside
groups
to
be
included
,
is
growing
more
urgent.it
’
s
a
question
increasingly
guided
by
concerns
over
the
inequities
laid
bare
by
the
pandemic
,
from
disproportionately
high
rates
of
infection
and
death
among
poor
people
and
people
of
color
to
disparate
access
to
testing
,
child
care
and
technology
for
online
schooling.
“
it
’
s
damnable
that
we
are
even
being
placed
in
this
position
that
we
have
to
make
these
choices
,
”
said
the
rev
.
william
j.
barber
ii
,
a
co-chairman
of
the
poor
people
’
s
campaign
,
a
national
coalition
that
calls
attention
to
the
challenges
of
the
working
poor
.
“
but
if
we
have
to
make
the
choice
,
we
can
not
once
again
leave
poor
and
low-wealth
essential
workers
to
be
last.
”
ultimately
,
the
choice
comes
down
to
whether
preventing
death
or
curbing
the
spread
of
the
virus
and
returning
to
some
semblance
of
normalcy
is
the
highest
priority
.
“
if
your
goal
is
to
maximize
the
preservation
of
human
life
,
then
you
would
bias
the
vaccine
toward
older
americans
,
”
dr.
scott
gottlieb
,
the
former
food
and
drug
administration
commissioner
,
said
recently
.
“
if
your
goal
is
to
reduce
the
rate
of
infection
,
then
you
would
prioritize
essential
workers
.
so
it
depends
what
impact
you
’
re
trying
to
achieve.
”
the
trade-off
between
the
two
is
muddied
by
the
fact
that
the
definition
of
“
essential
workers
”
used
by
the
c.d.c
.
comprises
nearly
70
percent
of
the
american
work
force
,
sweeping
in
not
just
grocery
store
clerks
and
emergency
responders
,
but
tugboat
operators
,
exterminators
and
nuclear
energy
workers
.
some
labor
economists
and
public
health
officials
consider
the
category
overbroad
and
say
it
should
be
narrowed
to
only
those
who
interact
in
person
with
the
public.an
independent
committee
of
medical
experts
that
advises
the
c.d.c
.
on
immunization
practices
will
soon
vote
on
whom
to
recommend
for
the
second
phase
of
vaccination
—
“
phase
1b.
”
in
a
meeting
last
month
,
all
voting
members
of
the
committee
indicated
support
for
putting
essential
workers
ahead
of
people
65
and
older
and
those
with
high-risk
health
conditions.historically
,
the
committee
relied
on
scientific
evidence
to
inform
its
decisions
.
but
now
the
members
are
weighing
social
justice
concerns
as
well
,
noted
lisa
a.
prosser
,
a
professor
of
health
policy
and
decision
sciences
at
the
university
of
michigan.
“

me

the

los

that

runs
counter
to

by
the
world
health

,
the
national

of

argued
that
teachers
should
not
be
included
as

workers
,
if
a
central
goal
of
the
committee
is
to
reduce
health
inequities.
“
teachers
have
middle-class
salaries
,
are
very
often
white
,
and
they
have
college
degrees
,
”
he
said
.
“
of

they
should
be
treated
better
,
but
they
are
not
among
the
most
mistreated
of
workers.
”
elise
gould
,
a
senior
economist
at
the
economic
policy
institute
,
disagreed
.
teachers
not
only
ensure
that
children
don
’
t
fall
further
behind
in
their
education
,
she
said
,
but
are
also
critical
to
the
work
force
at
large.
“
when
you
talk
about
disproportionate
impact
and
you
’
re
concerned
about
people
getting
back
into
the
labor
force
,
many
are
mothers
,
and
they
will
have
a
harder
time
if
their
children
don

t
have
a
reliable
place
to
go

”
she
said
.
“
and
if
you
think
generally
about
people
who
have
jobs
where
they
can

t
telework
,
they
are
disproportionately
black
and
brown
.
they
’

have
more
of
a

when
child
care
is
an

”
in
september
,
academic
researchers
analyzed
the
department
of
homeland
security
’
s
list
of
essential
workers
and
found
that
it
broadly
mirrored
the
demographics
of
the
american
labor
force
.
the
researchers
proposed
a
narrower
,
more
vulnerable
category
—
“
frontline
workers
,
”
such
as
food
deliverers
,
cashiers
and
emergency
medical
technicians
,
who
must
work
face
to
face
with
others
and
are
thus
at
greater
risk
of
contracting
the
virus.by
this
definition
,
said
francine
d.
blau
,
a
labor
economist
at
cornell
university
and
an
author
of
the
study
,
teachers
belong
in
the
larger
category
of
essential
workers
.
however
,
when
they
work
in
classrooms
rather
than
remotely
,
she
said
,
they
would
fit
into
the
“
frontline
”
group
.
individual
states
categorize
teachers
differently.dr
.
blau
said
that
if
supplies
are
short
,
frontline
workers
should
be
emphasized
.
“
these
are
a
subset
of
essential
workers
who
,
given
the
nature
of
their
jobs
,
must
provide
their
labor
in
person
.
prioritizing
them
makes
sense
given
the
heightened
risk
that
they
face.
”
the
analysis
,
a
working
paper
for
the
national
bureau
of
economic
research
,
is
in
line
with
other
critics
,
who
say
that
the
list
of
essential
workers
is
too
wide-ranging.
“
if
groups
are
too
large
,
then
you
’

not
really
focusing

dr.

who
are
older

in
good
health

able
to
socially
distance.he
said
:

”
all
these
plans
are
,
of
course
,
unfurling
with
essential
information
still
unknown.many
state
officials
said
that
as
on-the-ground
realities
emerge
,
they
fully
expect
their
plans
to
evolve.one
uncertainty
:
given
the
high
rates
of
apprehension
swirling
around
this
vaccine
,
how
many
people
in
the
early
groups
will
actually
line
up
for
it
?
“
if
a
high
proportion
of
essential
workers
decline
to
get
the
vaccine
,
states
will
have
to
quickly
move
onto
the
next
group
anyway
,
”
said
dr.
prosser
,
the
university

health
analyst
.
“
because
once
the
vaccines
arrive
,
they
will
have
to
be
used
in
a
certain
amount
of
time
before
they
degrade
.
``
early
results
from
a
british
vaccine
study
suggest
that
mixing
different
brands
of
vaccines
can
provoke
a
protective
immune
response
against
covid-19
.
in
the
trial
,
volunteers
produced
high
levels

immune

after
getting
one
dose
of
the
pfizer-biontech

and
one
dose
of
the

shot.administering
the
vaccines
in
either
order
is
likely
to
provide
potent
protection

matthew
snape
,
a
vaccine
expert
at
the

,
said
at
a

conference
on

.
“
any
of

would

”
he
said.dr
.
snape
and
his
colleagues
began
the
trial
,
called
com-cov
,
in
february
.
in
the
first
wave
of
the
study
,
they
gave
830
volunteers
one
of
four
combinations
of
vaccines
.
some
got
two
doses
of
either
pfizer
or
astrazeneca
,
both
of
which
have
been
shown
to
be
effective
against
covid-19
.
others
got
a
dose
of
astrazeneca
,
followed
by
one
of
pfizer
,
or
vice
versa.for
the
first
wave
of
volunteers
,
the
researchers
waited
four
weeks
between
doses
.
studies
have
found
that
the
astrazeneca
vaccine
provides
stronger
protection
if
the
second
dose
is
delayed
for
up
to
12
weeks
,
so
the
researchers
are
also
running
a
separate
12-week
trial
which
should
deliver
results
next
month.the
researchers
found
that
volunteers
reported
more
chills
,
headaches
and
muscle
pain
than
people
who
get
two
doses
of
the
same
vaccine
.
but
the
side
effects
were
short-lived.dr
.
snape
and
his
colleagues
then
drew
blood
to
measure
the
immune
response
in
the
volunteers
.
they
found
that
those
who
got
two
doses
of
pfizer-biontech
produced
levels
of
antibodies
about
10
times
as
high
as
those
who
got
two
doses
of

.
volunteers
who
got

followed
by
astrazeneca
showed
antibody
levels
about
five
times
as

with

reached
antibody
levels
about
as
high
as
those
who
got
two
doses
of

.
snape
said
that
the
differences
would
most
likely
narrow
in
the
volunteers
who
get
a
second
dose
after
12
weeks
,
when
the
astrazeneca
vaccine
has
had
more
time
to
strengthen
its
effects.the
study
also
found
that
using
different
vaccines
produced
a
higher
level
of
immune
cells
primed
to
attack
the
coronavirus
than
did
giving
two
doses
of
the
same
vaccine
.
dr.
snape
said
it
wasn

t
clear
yet
why
mixing
had
that
advantage
.
“
it

very
intriguing

much

”
he
said.dr

from

list
of
possibilities.for
now
,
he
said
,
the
best
course
of
action
remains
getting
two

of
the

.
large
clinical
trials
have
clearly
demonstrated
that
this
strategy
reduces
the
chances
of
getting
covid-19

“
your
default
should
be
what
is

”
dr.
snape
said.but
there
are
many
cases
in
which
that
may
not
be
possible

vaccine
shipments
are
sometimes
delayed

for

.
younger
people
in
some
countries
have
been
advised
not

clots

because
the

published

conclude

the

the

of

virus
found
in

differs
from

by
about
1100
nucleotides
,
which
means
decades
must
have
passed
before
it
evolved
into
the

other

in

it

up

has
set
off
a

of
research
to
understand
why
delta
appears
to
spread
so
much
faster

the
three
other

whether

one
of
her
concerns
is
whether

could
induce

last

reported

this

reported
that

in
stemmer
’

antibody
levels
were
between
one-quarter

one-third
of
their
healthy
family
members
’
after
they
got
a
vaccine
.
the
difference
doesn

strongly
concern
stemmer
,
but
because
the
level
of
sars-cov-2
antibodies
declines
naturally
over
time
,
he
wonders
whether
they
may
drop
worryingly
low
in
cancer
patients
sooner
,
because
they
start
from

level
.
parikh
agrees
this
is
a
big
question
:
“
we
don

know
how
quickly
these

titers

going

fall

”
he
says.stemmer
is
continuing
to
follow
his
cohort
and
plans
to
test
antibody
levels
every
2

3
months
.
he
also
wants
to
learn
more
about
the
small
group
of
patients
that
produced
no
antibodies
to
sars-cov-2
at
all
:
they
include
three
women
with

cancer

”
chemotherapy
,

means
less
time
between
treatments
.
third

doses
might
be
helpful
in
some
cases
,

stemmer
says
he
would
only
offer
them
as

hopes
more
information

right
now
,
he
acknowledges
,
“
there
is
a
lack
of
guidance
and
a
lack
of

”
in
the
meantime
,
segev
recognizes
that
some
people
may
prefer
to
take
matters
into
their
own
hands
,
whereas
others
would
eagerly
join
a
clinical
trial—though
he
urges
anyone
considering
a
third

dose
to
speak
to
their
doctor
first
.
“

itself
last

april
,
with
brazil
facing

,
citing
concerns
that

that
could

and
harm

the
decision
sparked
a
lawsuit

by

the
gamaleya

,
and
drew

on
4

the

put
the

that

fewer
than

still
“
not

”
he
adds

“
it
is
not

for

what
was
the
rationale
used

how
the

viruses
can
be
safe.
”
some
scientists
outside
the
fray
have
previously
said
anvisa
is
misreading
such
russian
documentation
.
they
argue
it
does
not
indicate
the
presence
of
live
virus
,
but
rather
the
detection
limits
of
tests
for
such
virus.according
to
a
brazilian
law
enacted
in
march
,
the
country
can
selectively
import
vaccines
already
approved
for
emergency
use
by
certain
countries—including
russia
.
so
anvisa
staffers
and
the
governors
had
several
meetings
to
discuss
ways
to
get
out

mendes

1
%

population
of
the
six
northern
states
that
filed
the
original
vaccine
request
,
which
called
for
67
million

.
the
batches
will
have
to
undergo
analysis
by
a
state-owned
lab
to
show
they
are
safe
and
do
not
contain
replicant
adenoviruses
,
and
only
healthy
adults
will
be
eligible
for
the
shots.moreover
,
the
states
administering
the
vaccine
must
disclose
to
the
population
that
the
regulatory
agency
did
not
clear
the
products
for
quality
,
safety
,
or
efficacy
.
and
in
a
step
proposed
by
the
brazilian
governors
,
the
states
will
have
to
conduct
a
sputnik

efficacy
study
under
anvisa

supervision.
“

rezende
maintains
that
anvisa
originally
vetoed

for
political
reasons
,
as
brazilian

considers

evidence
shows
its

works
well

the

has
an
international

turned

said
it
would

its
mrna

,
although
it
wanted

to
compare

then
a
few
weeks
ago
,
just
as

to
back
out

moderna

reluctance
to
have
its

led
to
the
change

of

organizers
,
however

suspect

factor

too
:
both

may
be
wary
that

complicate
getting

approval
for

;
the

.
half
the

mrna

the

initially

as
soon
as

emerged
that

protects

,
the

ethicists
have
long
debated
whether

still
be
given

once
a
proven
product
exists
,

a
south
african
researcher

notes
it

received

ethical
reviews

,
“

receive

they
will
be

”
moderna
,
however
,
says
it
wants

move
on
to

its

formulation

“

”
but
gray
and
other

of

say
the

also
expressed

to
them
about

tantalizing
results
from

the

is
far
from

.
a
bigger
study
is
critical
for
both
science
and
policy
,
corey
says
.
“
having
data
showing
the
efficacy
of
mrna
in
this
region
provides
the
hard
facts
that
excluding
these
countries
from
access
[
to
this
type
of
vaccine
]
is
medically
inappropriate.
”
trial
organizers
hope
a
deal
can
still
be
reached
with
moderna
.
they
note
that
in
theory
,
the
u.s.
government
could
assume
liability
and
provide
the
trial
with
the
vaccine
.
a
u.s.
government
official
familiar
with
the
negotiations
says
the
hitch
is
the
public
readiness
and
emergency
preparedness
act
,
which
indemnifies
covid-19
vaccine
manufacturers
but
only
in
the
united
states
.
amending
the
act
to
provide
international
indemnity
would
require
action
at
the
highest
government
levels
.
alternatively
,
the
south
african
government
could
indemnify
the
company
,
and
gray
says
such
negotiations
are
underway.if
the
mrna
vaccine
trial
goes
forward
and
proves
that
the
current
moderna
vaccine
works
against
the
beta
variant
,
gray
predicts
moderna
and
pfizer
will
still
move
forward
with
reformulated
vaccines
targeting
different
variants
as
well
as
the
original
virus
.
and
that
could
lead
to
a
windfall
for
the
african
continent
,
as
rich
countries
embrace
the
new
formulations
.
“
there
would
be
a
whole
lot
of
[
original
]
mrna
vaccine
lying
around
that
nobody
wants
,
”
she
envisions
.
“
there
’
d
be
all
these
stashes
of
it
all
over
the
place
,
and
we
could
acquire
it
cheaper.

that
could
help

a

the

whereas
the

the

“

,
allman

debuts
in

however
.
the
two

did
not
seek
u.s.

,
allman
says
,
the

several

the

more

,

they
wonder
whether

.
“
it

her

decided
to
go
ahead
,
she
adds
,
“
because
we
do
not

and
because
of
the
importance

”
the
test
asks
whether
someone
is
of
non-european
ancestry
,
which
data
suggest
increases
the
risk

,
so
dite
believes
it
is
relevant
for
u.s.

members
of

have
proposed
using

.
yet
that
doesn

mean
a

will
quickly
find
medical
use
,
khera
adds
.
“
there

“

still
,
many

chanock
,
who

looking
for

himself
,
believe

,
chanock
notes
:
“

one
of
the
countries
hardest
hit
by

,
has
shown
that
even
a
vaccine
that
had
low
efficacy
in
some
clinical

can
dramatically
control
the

part
of
an
unusual
experiment
to
track
the
real-world
effectiveness

a
covid-19

made

a
chinese

almost
all

the
results
were
dramatic
.
symptomatic
cases
of

have
dropped
by
80
%
since
the

hospitalizations
fell
86
%
,
and

plummeted

,
the

reported
during

cases
have
risen
out

“

that
produces
the

in

“

it

us
that
it

surely
possible

control
the
epidemic
through
vaccination.
”
some

covid-19

have
demonstrated
greater
than
90
%
real-world
effectiveness
at
preventing
serious
disease
,
and
they
have
helped
countries
bring
cases
down
to
very
low
levels
.
but
there
has
been
concern
about
coronavac
,
which
uses
an
inactivated
copy
of
sars-cov-2
to
stimulate

clinical

conducted
in
several
countries
came
up

later

brazil
that
tried

real-world
effectiveness
have
indicated
similar
levels
of
protection.that
’
s
why
the
data
from
serrana
are
reassuring
to
many
scientists
in
brazil
,
where
coronavac
makes
up
80
%
of
all

maciel
is
especially
relieved
the

protected
the
town
because
a
sars-cov-2
variant
dubbed
p1
,
which
originated
in
brazil
and
is
now
the
most
prevalent
in
the
country
,
was
also
the
most
common
variant
in

during
the
period

lab

suggested
p1

below
the

ahead
of

.
brazil
’
s
vaccination
campaign
,
slow
to
get
off
the
ground
because
of
scarce
vaccine
supplies
,
is
still
only
targeting
the
elderly
and
patients
with
comorbidities
.
only
15
%
of
the
population
has
had
at
least
one
vaccine

mass
vaccination
experiment
in
serrana
was
named
project
s—not
for
the
town
,
but
for
“
secret
,
”
as
the
plans
were
initially
kept
quiet
to
avoid
a
massive
migration
to
the
town
.
when
it
began
,
one
in
20
serrana
residents
was
infected
,
and
more
than
25
%
had
been
previously
exposed
to
the
virus
.
the
high
caseload
made
the
town
attractive
as
a
test
site
,
along
with
its
modest
population
of
just
over
45,000
people
and
its
proximity
to
a
campus
of
the
university
of
são
paulo.the
team
of
about
15
researchers
,
supported
by
local
authorities
and
health
professionals
,
first
conducted
a
detailed
census
.
then
they
divided
serrana
into
25
sections
that
represented
microcosms
of
people
who
interact
with
each
other—for
example
,
residents
living
in
the
same
group
of
buildings
or
shopping
in
the
same
stores
.
the
researchers
then
assembled
four
groups
of
residents
from
these
clusters
and
started
to
vaccinate
each
group
1
week
apart
,
administering
second
doses
4
weeks
after
the
first
.
only
residents
18
years
and
older
who
weren
’
t
suffering
from
chronic
diseases
and
not
pregnant
were
eligible
.
after
8
weeks
,
96
%
of
those
,
about
27,000
in
total
,
had
received
two
shots.although
the
town
was
never
closed
or
isolated
from
neighboring
cities
,
the
researchers
say
they
started
to
see
a
reduction
in
transmission
almost
immediately
after
the
first
group
got
its
second
dose
.
by
the
time
the
third
group
received
its
second
dose
,
and
about
75
%
of
the
eligible
population
was
immunized
,
the
outbreak
was
effectively
under
control.the
researchers
suggest
the
vaccination
campaign
,
combined
with
the
population
’
s
previous
infections
,
may
have
gotten
the
town
to
“
herd
immunity
,
”
the
point
at
which
the
coronavirus
has
difficulty
finding
new
people
to
infect
because
so
many
are
already
immune
.
on
day
14
after
the
last
vaccination
,
there
were
only
two
cases
among
vaccinated
people
and
no
deaths
.
“
it
was
amazing
,
”
palacios
says
.
covid-19
cases
,
hospitalizations
,
and
deaths
also
plummeted
among
children
and
teenagers
,
none
of
whom
received
the
vaccine.no
severe
side
effects
were
reported
.
the
team
says
the
results
will
soon
be
submitted
to
a
journal
for
publication
and
it
may
post
a
preprint
before
that

the

plans
to
track

for
up

whether

wanes
.
if
it
does
so
quickly
,
ending
the
pandemic
using

might
be
hard
,
because
brazil
would
probably
need
to
start
giving
booster
shots
even
before
it
has
fully
vaccinated
the
entire
population.
“
if
the

efficacy
period
is
short
and
we
keep
the
current
pace
of

herd
immunity
will
never

’
s
findings
come
as
israel
and
many
european
countries
are
debating
whether
younger
adolescents
should
be
vaccinated
against

.
israel
has
been
vaccinating
teenagers
16
and
older
since
late​
january
,
and
the
ministry
of
health
is
scheduled
to
announce
tomorrow
whether
vaccinations
will

other
countries
,
including
the
united
states

canada
,
began
vaccinating

and
older
in
mid-may.
“
from
a
parent
’
s
perspective
,
this
really
comes
down
to
risk
perception
,
assessment
of
the
data
,
”
says
diekema
,
who
has
studied
risk-benefit
trade-offs
.
even
if
a
link
between
myocarditis
and
the
vaccine
holds
up
,
the
condition
is
usually
mild
,
requiring
treatment
only
with
anti-inflammatory
drugs
,
whereas
covid-19
infection
can
also
cause
serious
disease
and
long-term
side
effects
,
even
in
young
people
.
as
suspicion
has
percolated
about
a
possible
connection

are
changing
their

says.in
israel
,
which
relied
almost
exclusively
on
the
pfizer-biontech
vaccine
in
its
early
and
fast
vaccination
drive
,
the
ministry
of
health
in
january
assembled
a
panel
led
by
dror
mevorach
,
head
of
internal
medicine
at
the
hadassah
university
medical
center
,
to
investigate
the
issue
.
mevorach
tells
science
he
and
his
colleagues
identified
110
myocarditis
cases
among
5
million
people
in
israel
who
had
received
two
doses
of
the
pfizer-biontech
vaccine
in
the
month
before
their
diagnosis
.
that
translates
to
about
one
in
50,000
vaccine
recipients
,
a
number
that
isn
’
t
concerning
given
the
background
rate
of
myocarditis
in
the
general
population
,
where
it
is
typically
triggered
by
viral
or
bacterial
infections
,
including
covid-19
.
but
the
rate
of
myocarditis
following
vaccination
among
young
men
was
higher
.
ninety
percent
of
the
cases
picked
up
in
israel
appeared
in
men
,
and
although
myocarditis
is
normally
more
common
among
young
men
,
the
rate
among
those
vaccinated
was
somewhere
between
five
and
25
times
the
background
rate
,
the
report
says
.
(
two
cases
of
fatal
myocarditis
have
also
been
reported
in
israel
,
but
the
panel
says
investigations
of
those
deaths
were
inconclusive
;
one
patient
may
have
had
a
more
generalized
inflammatory
syndrome
,
and
the
other
diagnosis
was
``
not
verified
,
''
the
report
says
.
)
the
new
analysis
“
is
very
suggestive
of
a
causal
nature
,
”
between
the
vaccine
and
myocarditis
,
mevorach
says
.
“
i
am
convinced
there
is
a
relationship.
”
“
it
does
suggest
that
this
is
,
at
least
statistically
,
a
real
phenomenon
,
”
says
peter
liu
,
a
cardiologist
and
chief
scientific
officer
of
the
university
of
ottawa
heart
institute
.
diekema
says
it
’
s
important
to
investigate
“
even
a
hint
of
a
signal
,
”
but
cautions
that
“
while
this
report
is
suggestive
…
it
requires
validation
in
other
populations
by
other
investigators
before
we
can
be
certain
the
link
exists.
”
other
factors
may
be
in
play
,
diekema
says
.
now
that
children
are
back
to
socializing
and
playing
sports
,
his
hospital
’
s
emergency
room
is
“
seeing
more
viral
diseases
than
we
’
ve
seen
in
a
year
,
”
and
as
a
result
,
“
i
would
expect
to
see
a
little
bump
in
myocarditis
versus
a
year
ago.
”
ideally
,
scientists
should
compare
cohorts
of
vaccinated
and
unvaccinated
youngsters
at
the
same
time
,
diekema
says
,
and
he
’
s
heartened
that
such
studies
are
now
gearing
up.myocarditis
cases
following
the
moderna
vaccine
,
which
isn
’
t
in
use
in
israel
,
are
also
being
investigated
in
the
united
states
.
it
’
s
not
clear
why
the
two
vaccines
,
which
both
rely
on
messenger
rna
(
mrna
)
,
might
heighten
the
risk
.
one
possibility
is
that
the
very
high
antibody
levels
that
both
generate
in
young
people
may
also
,
in
rare
cases
,
lead
to
a
sort
of
immune
overreaction
that
inflames
the
heart
.
“
there
’
s
no
question
these
[
vaccines
]
are
extremely
immune-generating
,
”
liu
says
.
mevorach
says
he
suspects
the
mrna
itself
might
be
playing
a
role
.
the
innate
immune
system
recognizes
rna
as
part
of
the
body
’
s
defense
against
microbes—including
rna
viruses
like
sars-cov-2
,
he
notes
.
“
i
think
that
actually
the
mrna
is
a
kind
of
natural
adjuvant
,
”
which
ramps
up
the
immune
response
,
he
says.diekema
says
the
medical
community
is
now
on
alert
for
youngsters
with
chest
pain
and
other
symptoms
soon
after
vaccination—allowing
them
to
be
quickly
identified
,
treated
,
and
reported
to
health
departments
.
mevorach
agrees
that
awareness
among
vaccinees
,
their
parents
,
and
their
doctors
is
important
for
prompt
and
effective
treatment
.
he
says
he
and
his
colleagues
treated
about
40
cases
.
only
a
few
needed
corticosteroids
,
he
said
,
and
most
have
recovered
fully.one
important
question
is
whether
delaying
the
second
vaccine
dose
might
reduce
any
potential
risk
.
there
may
be
an
opportunity
to
find
out
:
several
countries
have
stretched
the
interval
between
the
two
doses
from
the
3
weeks
tested
and
recommended
by
pfizer
to
12
or
even
16
weeks
,
because
they
want
to
give
as
many
people
as
possible
at
least
one
shot
.
a
drop
in
myocarditis
cases
among
those
whose
second
dose
was
delayed
might
show
up
in
data
in
the
months
ahead
.
lowering
the
dose
in
young
people
may
also
be
worth
considering
,
liu
says
.
pfizer
’
s
and
moderna
’
s
vaccines
are
now
being
tested
at
lower
doses
in
children
under
12
,
with
results
expected
in
the
coming
months.even
if
the
link
between
the
shots
and
myocarditis
firms
up
,
liu
says
the
vaccine
’
s
benefit—being
well-protected
from
covid-19—outweighs
the
risks
,
even
for
young
people
,
who
are
generally
at
lower
risk
of
severe
disease
.
but
mevorach
says
the
trade-offs
may
be
different
in
israel
,
given
its
extremely
low
numbers
of
sars-cov-2
infections—just
15
new
cases
were
diagnosed
yesterday
.
he
hopes
the
ministry
of
health
will
leave
the
decision
on
whether
to
vaccinate
younger
teens
to
their
parents
and
doctors
.
“
at
the
moment
,
we
no
longer
have
an
emergency
,

again

into
whether

behind

escaped
from

biden
outlined

the

,
apparently
even
if

declines
to
allow

came
as

this

that

statement
says
:
as

today

the

has
“
coalesced
around
two
likely
scenarios
”
but
has
not
reached
a
definitive
conclusion
on
this
question
.
here
is
their
current
position
:
while
two
elements
in
the
ic
leans
toward
the
former
scenario
and
one
leans
more
toward
the
latter
–
each
with
low
or
moderate
confidence
–
the
majority
of
elements
do
not
believe
there
is
sufficient
information
to
assess
one
to
be
more
likely
than
the
other.as

absolutely

we
do

the
kind
of

open
transparency

all
the

very

is
with

possible
in

situation
and
really
try
to
find
out
what
happened
.
i
agree
with
him
that
it
is
most
likely
that
this
is
a
virus
that
arose
naturally
,
but
we
can
not
exclude
the
possibility
of
some
kind
of
a
lab
accident

said

this

we
need

no-holds-barred
collection

we

”
carusone
says.it
has
been
distressing
to
watch
for
researchers
who
use
vaers
to
detect
real
vaccine
side
effects—such
as
the
very
rare
clotting
disorder
linked
to
the
johnson

vaccine—and
to
rule
out
others
,
thus
providing
both
safety
and
reassurance
to
the
public
.
“
i
can
’
t
believe
people
are
using
this

now
to
try
to
form
this
antivaccination
argument
,
”
says
eric
formeister
,
an
ear
surgeon
at
johns
hopkins
university.formeister
and
colleagues
turned
to
vaers
,
which
is
run
by
cdc
and
the
food
and
drug
administration
,
after
hearing
anecdotal
reports
from
patients
of
sudden
hearing
loss
after
covid-19
vaccination
.
their
analysis
of
vaers
data
concluded
hearing
loss
was
no
more
frequent
,
and
possibly
less
frequent
,
among
vaccine
recipients
than
in
the
population
as
a
whole
,
as
they
published
in
jama
otolaryngology
last
week
.
cdc
is
now
using
vaers
data
to
probe
whether
covid-19
vaccines
might
rarely
be
causing
heart
inflammation
in
children
;
it
has
not
yet
reached
a
conclusion.one
of
vaers
’
s
strengths—its
openness—is
also
a
potential
weakness
in
the
politicized
covid-19
era
.
anyone
who
receives
a
vaccine
authorized
in
the
united
states
can
report
an
adverse
event
to
vaers
,
as
can
doctors
,
family
members
,
and
others
.
that
openness
ensures
vaers
receives
plentiful
reports—228,000
for
covid-19
vaccines
alone
since
december
2020
,
more
than
four
times
the
number
received
in
all
of
last
year
for
all
vaccines.some
worry
this
might
make
it
easy
to
post
false
reports
.
but
cdc
removes
data
that
are
clearly
fake
,
such
as
a
recent
report
purportedly
filed
by
brazilian
president
jair
bolsonaro
about
an
adverse
event
in
a
beach
volleyball
superstar
.
and
deliberate
,
false
reporting
to
vaers
,
which
is
a
federal
criminal
offense
,
appears
to
be
rare
.
“
we
don
’
t
have
evidence
that
there
is
widespread
fraud
or
gaming
of
the

,
”
says
tom
shimabukuro
,
deputy
director
of
cdc
’
s
immunization
safety
office
,
which
oversees
vaers
.
“
we
have
to

getting
as

”
but
even
honest
reports
can
be
used
to
spook
the
public
.
the
reports
themselves
are
not
vetted
,
and
,
as
cdc
states
in
a
prominent
disclaimer
,
they
“
may
include
incomplete
,
inaccurate
,
coincidental
and
unverified

”
people
may
misinterpret
vaers
,
which
is
easily
searchable
,
as
a
catalog
of
actual
side
effects
,
rather
than
possible
or
suspected
ones
.
and
it
’
s
easy
to
pull
data
out
of
context
.
“
for
those
who
are
out
to

there

a

of

the
fox
news
host
did
not
mention
the
reports
are
not
vetted
,
nor
that
among
the
approximately
4000
deaths
after
covid-19
vaccination
reported
to
vaers
at
the
time
of
his
broadcast
,
nearly
80
%

in

60
and
older
,
whose
mortality
from
all

is
substantially
higher
than
in

.
“
a
review
of
available
clinical
information
,
including
death
certificates
,

,
and
medical
records
has
not
established
a
causal
link
to

,
”
as
cdc
puts
it
on
its
website.to
counter
misinterpretation
of
its
data
,
the
vaers
website
prominently
notes
the
reports
do
not
imply
causality
and
that
any
event
could
have
happened
by
coincidence
.
the
number
of
deaths
reported
after
a
covid-19
vaccination
as
of
24
may—4863—represents
just
0.0017
%
of
more
than
285
million
doses
of
vaccine
given
,
the
agency
notes
in
a
continuously
updated
statement.but
experts
who
track
vaccine
misinformation
worry
the
imprimatur
of
vaers
gives
misleading
claims
a
sheen
of
credibility
.
“
at
the
moment
when
we
need
to
persuade
people
,
there
is
something
so
incredibly
compelling
about
a
database

tracking
what
are
designated
as
‘

’
”
carusone
says
.
“
that
tucker
segment
has
created
this
catalyst
for
all
sorts
of
analysis
of

,
”
including
false
claims
that
the
vaccines
kill
babies
and
that
cdc
is
hiding
vaers

says
the
episode
has
gained
particular
traction
on
spanish-language
social

,
where
a
translation
was
published
2
days
later
.
there
,
false
claims
that
covid-19
vaccines
cause
infertility
have
also
gained
attention
,
although
neither
vaers
data
nor
carlson
’
s
newscast
address
that
claim.despite
the
disinformation
,
the
vaers
system
is
critical
to
keeping
vaccines
safe—and
its
history
during
covid-19
shows
it
’
s
working
,
cdc
officials
say
.
vaers

were
crucial
to
cdc
’
s
ability
to
quickly
detect
and
guide
providers
and
the
public
about
rare
allergic
reactions
caused
by
the
pfizer-biontech
and
moderna
vaccines
and
the
even
rarer
problem
with

,
says
john
su
,
a
physician
who
leads
the
vaers
team
within
cdc

.
keeping
the
system
open
to
anyone
who
wants
to
report
a
suspected
side
effect
or
wants
to
consult
the
data
is
essential
,
he
says.but
larson
says
cdc
and
the
public
health
community
need
to
make
a
“
serious
investment
right
now
”
to
more
aggressively
counter
the
misuse
of
vaers

,
for
example
by
responding
as
quickly
as
possible
to

myths
that
are
gaining
traction

so
in

out

the

“

”
he
said

buying
up

covid-19

,
leaving
tiny
amounts
for

replay
of
what

more

moral
argument
aside
,
there
’

a
very
practical
reason
to
try
to
distribute
vaccines
more
equitably
:
no
part
of
the

can
feel
safe
if
the
pandemic
rages
on
elsewhere
,
posing
the

it

to
be
working
:
almost
every
country
in

has
signed
up

covax
began
to
deliver
its
first
vaccine
doses
on
24
february
,
just
2
months
after
vaccinations
started
in
europe
.
but
covax
lacked
the
money
to
compete
with
rich

that
cornered
the
market
early
on
by
striking
purchase
deals

question
thousands

have
faced
over

months
but
that
you
don

hear
much
about.i
knew
i
might
face
this
dilemma
since
21

,
the
day
i
drove
to
a
behemoth
academic
center
in
the
southeastern
part
of
amsterdam
,
my
hometown
,
to
enroll
in
the
herald
study
,
a
large
efficacy
trial
of
a
candidate
covid-19
vaccine
produced
by
the
company
curevac
.
i
sat
down
in
a
small
basement
room
with
an
infectious
diseases
physician
who
provided
some
basic
information
about
the
study
,
gave
me
a
consent
form
to
sign
,
and
carried
out
a
physical
examination.then
came
an
important
moment
:
i
was
going
to
be
randomly
assigned
to
receive
either
the
experimental
vaccine
or
a
placebo
.
the
researcher
clicked
a
few
buttons
on
her
computer
,
then
read
a
message
that
had
popped
up
on
her
screen
:
“

you
.
the

been
successfully
randomized.
”
half
an
hour
later
,
a

gave
me
an
injection
.
neither
of
us
knew
what
was
in
it
:
12
micrograms
of

packaged
in
tiny

might
save
me

``
it

was
a
worthwhile
gamble

i
had
a
50
%
chance
of
receiving
a

vaccine
at
a
time
when
case
numbers
in
the
netherlands
were
high
,
the
more
transmissible
variant
that
first
emerged
in
the
united
kingdom
was
taking
over
,
and
it
might
be
many
months
before
i
was
eligible
for
a
proven
vaccine
,
as
doses
were
scarce
in
europe
.
the
chance
at
protection
aside
,
i
was
happy
to
play
a
tiny
part
in
one
of
the
great
scientific
endeavors
of
my
lifetime—and
,
with
luck
,
help
another
vaccine

the
finish
line.curevac

.
i
had
no
side
effects
at
all
from
that
first
shot
or
from
the
second
one
,
4
weeks
later
.
my
participation
in
the
trial
did
not
lead
me
to
take
more
risks
,
a
well-known
phenomenon
in
vaccine
studies
.
at
times
i
even
wondered
how
useful
i
was
for
a
test
of
the
vaccine
’
s
ability
to
prevent
infection
,
given
my
low
exposure
risk
:
i
work
at
home
and
was
cautious
about
social
contacts
.
i
did
go
back
to
the
hospital
for
a
covid-19
test
once
,
in
february
,
when
i
had
what
seemed
very
mild
symptoms
.
the
test
came
back
negative.the
written
information
i
received
about
the
study
did
not
discuss
the
options
should
a
participant
become
eligible
for
a
proven
vaccine
.
and
initially
,
it
looked
like
i
might
not
have
that
choice
.
vaccination
in
europe
has
moved
slowly
,
and
the
study
would
likely
report
the
first
data
within
a
few
months
,
the
study
team
told
me
,
before
i
became
eligible
for
an
authorized
vaccine
.
curevac
planned
to
do
the
final
analysis
of
its
study
after
185
confirmed
covid-19
infections
had
occurred
,
according
to
the
clinical
trial
protocol
,
but
the
first
interim
analysis
was
scheduled
after
just
56
cases
,
which
should
not
take
long
.
(
efficacy
is
calculated
by
comparing
the
number
of
cases
of
symptomatic
disease
in
the
vaccine
and
placebo
groups
.
)
if
the
trial
reached
a
clear
conclusion
and
was
halted
,
i
would
be
unblinded
.
if
cvncov
had
been
shown
to
work
,
as
the
researchers
expected
,
i
would
have
essentially
two
options
:
if
i
had
received
placebo
shots
,
i
would
be
offered
the
vaccine
,
and
i
’
d
be
safe
.
if
i
had
received
cvncov
,
i
had
been
safe
all
along
and
wouldn
’
t
need
anything
else.a
curevac
faq
,
still
posted
,
says
the
company
expects
the
first
data
from
an
interim
analysis
in
the
first
quarter
of
this
year
.
but
that
deadline
came
and
went
,
and
in
april
,
the
pace
of
vaccination
in
my
country
began
to
pick
up
.
having
started
with
people
ages
90
and
older
,
municipal
health
services
were
working
their
way
down
the
birth
cohorts
,
and
as
the
weeks
went
by
,
it
seemed
increasingly
likely
that
my
year
,
1964
,
would
come
up
before
any
announcement
from
tübingen.if
that
happened
,
i
could
also
be
unblinded
,
the
researchers
had
said
,
but
it
would
open
a
different
set
of
questions
.
if
it
turned
out
that
i
received
cvncov
shots
,
i
could
be
altruistic
and
stay
in
the
trial
until
its
completion
,
knocking
on
wood
that
the
vaccine
worked
as
well
as
the
other
mrna
vaccines
;
or
i
could
err
on
the
side
of
safety
,
drop
out
,
and
get
whatever
the
government
had
planned
for
me
.
if
it
turned
out
i
had
the
placebo
,
i
had
the
same
two
options
but
staying
in
would
be
dicier
still
,
because
i
would
be
completely
unprotected
.
(
the
trial
would
not
give
me
the
vaccine
in
that
case
,
because
its
value
had
not
yet
been
shown
.
)
i
asked
two
scientists
who
had
also
volunteered
in
covid-19
vaccine
trials
for
advice
.
florian
krammer
,
a
virologist
at
the
icahn
school
of
medicine
at
mount
sinai
and
a
subject
in
pfizer
’
s
efficacy
trial
,
says
he
was
asked
in
an
email
in
december
2020
whether
he
wanted
to
be
unblinded
,
after
an
analysis
of
trial
data
showed
the
pfizer
vaccine
was
highly
effective
.
“
i
was
contemplating
just
staying
blinded
,
because
of
course
,
i
’
m
a
data
point
,
”
krammer
said
.
“
but
there
were
a
lot
of
covid-19
cases
back
then.
”
besides
,
if
it
turned
out
he
had
the
placebo
,
pfizer
would
offer
krammer
the
shot
,
and
he
would
remain
a
data
point
,
but
as
part
of
the
trial
’
s
other
arm
.
krammer
chose
to
be
unblinded
,
learned
he
had
a
placebo
,
and
received
the
vaccine
in
january
.
he
is
still
in
the
study.my
situation
was
different
because
curevac
did
not
have
efficacy
data
yet
.
krammer
said
staying
in
would
be
“
noble
”
but
that
i
should
also
think
about
myself
.
“
signing
up
for
a
trial
is
already
a
very
,
very
helpful
thing
,
”
he
said
.
“
nobody
can
expect
you
to
stay
in
if
there
are
[
vaccines
]
available
that
will
protect
you
from
getting
severe
disease
or
from
dying.
”
he
pointed
out
that
dropping
out
now
would
not
void
my
participation
altogether
:
the
past
4
months
were
already
part
of
the
data
.
and
this
wasn
’
t
just
about
me
,
he
added
:
“
what
if
you
stay
in
the
placebo
group
and
you
get
infected
and
you
infect
somebody
else
and
that
person
dies
?
”
virologist
john
moore
of
weill
cornell

college
faced
a
slightly
different
dilemma
.
he
had
volunteered
for
an
efficacy
study
in
the
united
states
and
mexico
of
the
vaccine
produced
by
novavax
,
which
began
in
late
december
2020
.
moore
says
he
decided
to
stay
in
the
study
even
after
he
became
eligible
for
a
proven
vaccine
at
his
hospital
at
some
point
in
february
or
march.interim
data
from
a
study
in
the
united
kingdom
in
late
january
showed
novavax
’
s
shot
had
89
%
efficacy
,
and
on
5
april
,
the
company
announced
that
both
the
u.k
and
u.s.-mexican
studies
would
switch
to
a
“
crossover
design
,
”
meaning
all
participants
would
be
offered
two
more
shots
.
those
who
first
received
a
placebo
would
now
receive
the
vaccine
,
and
vice
versa
,
but
everybody
would
remain
blinded
.
for
participants
,
the
advantage
is
that
they
know
they
’
re
all
protected
;
for
the
company
,
it
’
s
a
way
to
keep
more
people
in
the
trial
,
allowing
it
,
for
example
,
to
do
better
studies
of
duration
of
immunity
and
of
the
responses
that
correlate
with
protection.moore
accepted
the
offer
to
cross
over
and
received
two
more
shots
,
the
last
one
on
11
may
;
he
feels
confident
that
he
’

protected
now
,
but
he
remained
unvaccinated
for
4
to
6
weeks
longer
than
he
would
have
been
if
he
had
dropped
out
.
“
i
didn

t
think
that

would
cost
me
very
much
,
”
he
says
.
“

has
not

move
to

in

,
it
has
not

much
at

about

of

many

,
could
significantly
expand
which

we

”
says
stanley

,
a
virologist
at
the
university
of
iowa
who
was
not
involved
in
the
new
work.the
researchers
have
not
definitely
linked
either
new
virus
to
human
disease
.
and
there
’
s
no
evidence
that
the
two
new
coronaviruses
can
transmit
between
people—each
infection
may
have
been
a
dead-end
jump
into
a
person
from
a
nonhuman
host
.
but
many
researchers
worry
the
viruses
may
evolve
that
ability
within
a
person
or
the
animals
they
normally
infect
.
a
complete
genome
sequence
of
the
virus
found
in
one
malaysian
patient
,
reported
today
in
clinical
infectious

,
reveals
a
chimera
of
genes
from
four
coronaviruses
:
two
previously
identified
canine
coronaviruses
,
one
known
to
infect
cats
,
and
what
looks

a

virus.this
is
the
first
report
suggesting
a

this

,
vlasova
cautions.the
eight
children
whose

vlasova

her
colleagues
studied
were
mainly
living
in
traditional
longhouses

villages
in
rural
or
suburban
sarawak
on
borneo
,
where
they
likely
had
frequent
exposure
to
domestic
animals
and
jungle
wildlife
.
they
were
among
301
hospitalized
pneumonia
patients
during
2017–18
and
the
researchers
screened
their
nasopharyngeal
samples—tissue
from
the
upper
part
of
the
throat—for
a
large
variety
of
human
and
nonhuman
coronaviruses.standard
hospital
diagnostics
for
pneumonia
or
other
respiratory
illness
would
not
have
detected
dog
and
cat
coronaviruses
.
no
one
has
been
looking
for
these
viruses
in
patients
with
such
illnesses
until
recently
.
“
these
canine
and
feline
coronaviruses
are
everywhere
in
the
world
,
”
perlman
says.the
entire
novel
virus
sequence
from
the
children
’
s
samples
most
resembles
a
canine
coronavirus
.
however
,
the
sequence
for
its
spike
protein
,
which
attaches
to
host
cell
receptors
to
initiate
an
infection
,
is
closely
related
to
the
spike
sequence
of
canine
coronavirus
type
i
and
the
one
for
a
porcine
coronavirus
known
as
transmissible
gastroenteritis
virus
.
and
one
part
of
the
spike
protein
bears
a
97
%
similarity
to
the
spike
of
a
feline
coronavirus
.
this
chimera
is
unlikely
to
have
arisen
at
once
,
but
instead
involved
repeat
genetic
reshuffles
between
different
coronaviruses
over
time
.
“
this
is
a
mosaic
of
several
different
recombinations
,
happening
over

over
,
when
nobody
’

watching

then

,
you
get

”

neuman
at
texas
a
&
m

college
station.the
animal
that
actually
transmitted
the
novel

to
the
people
could
have
been
a
cat
,
pig
,

,
“
or
some
wild
carnivores
,
”
says
vito
martella
,
a
veterinary
virologist
at

university
of
bari
in
italy
.
he
plans
to
screen
stored
fecal
samples
from
italian
children
with
acute
gastroenteritis
to
see
whether
he
can
find
something
similar.researchers
already
knew
three
canine
coronavirus
subtypes
mix
readily
with
feline
and
porcine
coronaviruses
.
“
what
is
more
surprising
is
that
these
[
animal
]
viruses
can
actually
cause
disease
in
a
person
,
”
perlman
says
,
because
one
would
expect
them
to
lack
some
of
the
genes
important
for
adapting
well
to
people.seven
of
the
eight
children
whose
tissues
harbored
sequences
of
the
virus
were
younger
than
5
years
old
,
and
four
of
them
were
infants
,
mostly
from
indigenous
ethnic
groups
.
each
was
hospitalized
for
4
to
7
days
and
recovered
.
scientists
divide
coronaviruses
into
four
genera—alpha
,
beta
,
gamma
,
and
delta—and
the
new
one
is
an
alpha
.
it
is
the
third
such
alpha
coronavirus
to
infect
people
;
the
other
two
cause
common
colds
,
and
most
people
are
exposed
to
them
early
in
life
.
that
pattern
may
explain
why
only
children
were
perhaps
sickened
by
this
new
one
.
ralph
baric
,
a
virologist
at
the

,
chapel
hill
,
suggests
adults
may
have
some
immunity
to
the
newly
discovered
alpha
coronavirus
because
of
repeated
exposure
to
the
other
two.so
far
,
the
most
dangerous
human
coronaviruses—sars-cov-1
,
sars-cov-2
,
and
mers-cov—are
the
betas
.

haven

t
seen
alphas
trigger
an
outbreak
of
serious
disease
in
humans

neuman
says
,
“

that
doesn
’
t
feel
like
much
comfort
in
the
wild
world
of

”
in
march
,
researchers
at

of

porcine
delta
coronavirus
that
infects
people
,
in
serum
from
three
haitian
children
who
had
fevers
in
2014–15
.
the
researchers
transferred
serum
samples
into
monkey
cells
and
were
able
to
grow
viruses
that
they
matched
,
genetically
,
to
known
porcine
coronaviruses
.
(
the
work
has
been
submitted
to

coronaviruses
were
once
thought
to
infect
only
birds
.
then
,
in
2012
,
a

“
there

”
some
virologists
have
labeled
the

.
the

differs
considerably

want
to
test

if
its

confirmed
,
it

also
be

,
saif
says.together
,
the

point
to
the

“

has
advanced
significantly
in

past
few
years
.
the
sars
epidemic
put
the
animal
coronaviruses
in
the
spotlight
.
the
background
and
history
relative
to
this
important
and
expanding
research
area
are
reviewed
here.the
history
of
human
coronaviruses
began
in
1965
when
tyrrell
and
bynoe1
found
that
they
could
passage
a
virus
named
b814
.
it
was
found
in
human
embryonic
tracheal
organ
cultures
obtained
from
the
respiratory
tract
of
an
adult
with
a
common
cold
.
the
presence
of
an
infectious
agent
was
demonstrated
by
inoculating
the
medium
from
these
cultures
intranasally
in
human
volunteers
;
colds
were
produced
in
a
significant
proportion
of
subjects
,
but
tyrrell
and
bynoe
were
unable
to
grow
the
agent
in
tissue
culture
at
that
time
.
at
about
the
same
time
,
hamre
and
procknow2
were
able
to
grow
a
virus
with
unusual
properties
in
tissue
culture
from
samples
obtained
from
medical
students
with
colds
.
both
b814
and
hamre
's
virus
,
which
she
called
229e
,
were
ether-sensitive
and
therefore
presumably
required
a
lipid-containing
coat
for
infectivity
,
but
these
2
viruses
were
not
related
to
any
known
myxo-
or
paramyxoviruses
.
while
working
in
the
laboratory
of
robert
chanock
at
the
national
institutes
of
health
,
mcintosh
et
al3
reported
the
recovery
of
multiple
strains
of
ether-sensitive
agents
from
the
human
respiratory
tract
by
using
a
technique
similar
to
that
of
tyrrell
and
bynoe
.
these
viruses
were
termed
“
oc
”
to
designate
that
they
were
grown
in
organ
cultures.within
the
same
time
frame
,
almeida
and
tyrrell4
performed
electron
microscopy
on
fluids
from
organ
cultures
infected
with
b814
and
found
particles
that
resembled
the
infectious
bronchitis
virus
of
chickens
.
the
particles
were
medium
sized
(
80–150
nm
)
,
pleomorphic
,
membrane-coated
,
and
covered
with
widely
spaced
club-shaped
surface
projections
.
the
229e
agent
identified
by
hamre
and
procknow2
and
the
previous
oc
viruses
identified
by
mcintosh
et
al3
had
a
similar
morphology
(
fig
.
1
)
.in
the
late
1960s
,
tyrrell
was
leading
a
group
of
virologists
working
with
the
human
strains
and
a
number
of
animal
viruses
.
these
included
infectious
bronchitis
virus
,
mouse
hepatitis
virus
and
transmissible
gastroenteritis
virus
of
swine
,
all
of
which
had
been
demonstrated
to
be
morphologically
the
same
as
seen
through
electron
microscopy.5,6
this
new
group
of
viruses
was
named
coronavirus
(
corona
denoting
the
crown-like
appearance
of
the
surface
projections
)
and
was
later
officially
accepted
as
a
new
genus
of
viruses.7ongoing
research
using
serologic
techniques
has
resulted
in
a
considerable
amount
of
information
regarding
the
epidemiology
of
the
human
respiratory
coronaviruses
.
it
was
found
that
in
temperate
climates
,
respiratory
coronavirus
infections
occur
more
often
in
the
winter
and
spring
than
in
the
summer
and
fall
.
data
revealed
that
coronavirus
infections
contribute
as
much
as
35
%
of
the
total
respiratory
viral
activity
during
epidemics
.
overall
,
he
proportion
of
adult
colds
produced
by
coronaviruses
was
estimated
at
15
%
.8in
the
3
decades
after
discovery
,
human

because
they
were

.
strain
229e
was
grown
in

directly
from

.
the
2
viruses
demonstrated
periodicity
,
with
large
epidemics
occurring
at
2-
to
3-year
intervals.9
strain
229e
tended
to
be
epidemic
throughout
the
united
states
,
whereas
strain
oc43
was
more
predisposed
to
localized
outbreaks
.
as
with
many
other
respiratory
viruses
,
reinfection
was
common.10
infection
could
occur
at
any
age
,
but
it
was
most
common
in
children.despite
the
extensive
focus
placed
exclusively
on
strains
229e
and
oc43
,
it
was
clear
that
there
were
other
coronavirus
strains
as
well
.
as
shown
by
bradburne,11
coronavirus
strain
b814
was
not
serologically
identical
with
either
oc43
or
229e
.
contributing
to
the
various
strain
differences
in
the
family
of
coronaviruses
,
mcintosh
et
al12
found
that
3
of
the
6
strains
previously
identified
were
only
distantly
related
to
oc43
or
229e.epidemiologic
and
volunteer
inoculation
studies
found
that
respiratory
coronaviruses
were
associated
with
a
variety
of
respiratory
illnesses
;
however
,
their
pathogenicity
was
considered
to
be
low.2,8,13,14
the
predominant
illness
associated
with
infections
was
an
upper
respiratory
infection
with
occasional
cases
of
pneumonia
in
infants
and
young
adults.15,16
these
viruses
were
also
shown
to
be
able
to
produce
asthma
exacerbations
in
children
as
well
as
chronic
bronchitis
in
adults
and
the
elderly.17–19while
research
was
proceeding
to
explore
the
pathogenicity
and
epidemiology
of
the
human
coronaviruses
,
the
number
and
importance
of
animal
coronaviruses
were
growing
rapidly
.
coronaviruses
were
described
that
caused
disease
in
multiple
animal
species
,
including
rats
,
mice
,
chickens
,
turkeys
,
calves
,
dogs
,
cats
,
rabbits
and
pigs
.
animal
studies
included
,
but
were
not
limited
to
,
research
that
focused
on
respiratory
disorders
.
study
focus
included
disorders
such
as
gastroenteritis
,
hepatitis
and
encephalitis
in
mice
;
pneumonitis
and
sialodacryoadenitis
in
rats
;
and
infectious
peritonitis
in
cats
.
interest
peaked
particularly
regarding
areas
of
encephalitis
produced
by
mouse
hepatitis
virus
and
peritonitis
produced
by
infectious
peritonitis
virus
in
cats
.
pathogenesis
of
these
disease
states
was
various
and
complex
,
demonstrating
that
the
genus
as
a
whole
was
capable
of
a
wide
variety
of
disease
mechanisms.20
human
and
animal
coronaviruses
were
segregated
into
3
broad
groups
based
on
their
antigenic
and
genetic
makeup
.
group
i
contained
virus
229e
and
other
viruses
,
group
ii
contained
virus
oc43
and
group
iii
was
made
up
of
avian
infectious
bronchitis
virus
and
a
number
of
related
avian
viruses.21given
the
enormous
variety
of
animal
coronaviruses
,
it
was
not
surprising
when
the
cause
of
a
very
new
,
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
,
called
sars
,
emerged
in
2002–2003
as
a
coronavirus
from
southern
china
and
spread
throughout
the
world
with
quantifiable
speed.22–24
this
virus
grew
fairly
easily
in
tissue
culture
,
enabling
quick
sequencing
of
the
genome
.
sequencing
differed
sufficiently
from
any
of
the
known
human
or
animal
coronaviruses
to
place
this
virus
into
a
new
group
,
along
with
a
virus
that
was
subsequently
cultured
from
himalayan
palm
civets
,
from
which
it
presumably
had
emerged.25during
the
2002–2003
outbreak
,
sars
infection
was
reported
in
29
countries
in
north
america
,
south
america
,
europe
and
asia
.
overall
8098
infected
individuals
were
identified
,
with
774
sars-related
fatalities.26
it
is
still
unclear
how
the
virus
entered
the
human
population
and
whether
the
himalayan
palm
civets
were
the
natural
reservoir
for
the
virus
.
sequence
analysis
of
the
virus
isolated
from
the
himalayan
palm
civets
revealed
that
this
virus
contained
a
29-nucleotide
sequence
not
found
in
most
human
isolates
,
in
particular
those
involved
in
the
worldwide
spread
of
the
epidemic.25
in
the
animal
viruses
,
this
nucleotide
sequence
maintains
the
integrity
of
the
10th
open
reading
frame
(
orf
)
;
whereas
in
the
human
strains
,
the
absence
of
this
motif
results
in
2
overlapping
orfs
.
the
function
of
the
orfs
in
the
animal
and
human
isolates
is
unknown
,
and
it
is
unclear
whether
the
deletion
of
the
29-nucleotide
sequence
played
a
role
in
the
transspecies
jump
,
the
capacity
of
the
epidemic
strain
to
spread
between
humans
or
the
virulence
of
the
virus
in
humans
.
curiously
data
from
seroepidemiologic
studies
conducted
among
food
market
workers
in
areas
where
the
sars
epidemic
likely
began
indicated
that
40
%
of
wild
animal
traders
and
20
%
of
individuals
who
slaughter
animals
were
seropositive
for
sars
,
although
none
had
a
history
of
sars-like
symptoms.25
these
findings
suggest
that
these
individuals
were
exposed
through
their
occupation
to
a
sars-like
virus
that
frequently
caused
asymptomatic
infection
.
infection
control
policies
may
have
contributed
to
the
halt
of
the
sars
epidemic
.
the
last
series
of
documented
cases
to
date
,
in
april
2004
,
were
laboratory-acquired.the
sars
epidemic
gave
the
world
of
coronaviruses
an
enormous
infusion
of
energy
and
activity
that
contributed
to
the
large
amount
already
known
about
the
virology
and
pathogenesis
of
coronavirus
infections
from
the
expanding
area
of
veterinary
virology.21coronaviruses
are
medium-sized
rna
viruses
with
a
very
characteristic
appearance
in
electron
micrographs
of
negatively
stained
preparations
(

)
.
the
nucleic
acid
is
about
30
kb
long
,
positive
in
sense
,
single
stranded
and
polyadenylated
.
the
rna
is
the
largest
known
viral
rna
and
codes
for
a
large
polyprotein
.
this
polyprotein
is
cleaved
by
viral-encoded
proteases
to
form
the
following
:
an
rna-dependent
rna
polymerase
and
an
atpase
helicase
;
a
surface
hemagglutinin-esterase
protein
present
on
oc43
and
several
other
group
ii
coronaviruses
;
the
large
surface
glycoprotein
(

)
that
forms
the
petal-shaped
surface
projections
;
a
small
envelope
protein
(
e

)
;
a
membrane
glycoprotein
(
m
protein
)
;
and
a
nucleocapsid
protein
(
n
protein
)
that
forms
a
complex
with
the
rna
.
the
coding
functions
of
several
other
orfs
are
not
clear
.
the
strategy
of
replication
of
coronaviruses
involves
a
nested
set
of
messenger
rnas
with
common
polyadenylated
3-ends
.
only
the
unique
portion
of
the
5-end
is
translated.21
mutations
are
common
in
nature
.
in
addition
,
coronaviruses
are
capable
of
genetic
recombination
if
2
viruses
infect
the
same
cell
at
the
same
time.all
coronaviruses
develop
in
the
cytoplasm
of
infected
cells
(

)
,
budding
into
cytoplasmic
vesicles
from
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
.
these

are
either
extruded

,
a

,
including

the

5

this
approach
was
based
on
the
theory
that
the
gene
for
the
viral
replicase
of
all
coronaviruses
has
conserved
genetic
sequences
that
encode
indispensable
,
essential
functions
and
that
these
sequences
could
be
targeted
for
virus
identification
and
discovery
.
this
approach
did
not
require
propagation
of
the

in

,
organ
cultures
or
experimental

and
could
be
performed
directly
on

although
his

was

,
a

amplified

from

with
the
use
of
primers
that
targeted
conserved
regions
of
the
viral
replicase
gene.35
this
novel
virus
,
designated
hku1
,
was
genetically
distinct
from
oc43
,
the
other
known
human
group
ii
coronavirus
.
this
virus
could
not
be
propagated
in

.
seroepidemiologic
studies
,
based
on
antibodies
reacting
with
a
recombinant
hku1
nucleocapsid
,
suggested
that
human
infection
with
hku1
might
be
common.35
however
,
it
is
unclear
whether
the
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
and
western
blot
assays
used
to
detect
hku1
antibody
were
also
detecting
cross-reactive
antibody
to
oc43
or
other
human
coronaviruses.the
field
of
coronavirology
has
advanced
significantly
in
recent
years
.
the
sars
epidemic
was
a
dramatic
reminder
that
animal
coronaviruses
are
potential
threats
to
the
human
population
,
although
the
exact
mechanism
of
species-to-species
spread
of
the

remains
obscure

nl63
has
been
identified

this
virus
and
the
related
viruses
nl
and
hcov-nh
are
likely
the
cause
of
a
substantial
proportion
of
respiratory
tract
disease
in
infants
and
children
.
the
impact
of
hku1
is
not
yet
known
.
it
seems
clear
that
the
coronaviruses
infecting
humans
and
causing
respiratory
disease
are
heterogeneous
and
quite
widely
distributed
among
groups
i
and
ii
.
it
may
be
that
some
of
the
newer
coronaviruses
represent
strains
similar
to
the
original
b814
and
oc
strains
that
could
not
be
further
characterized
in
the
1960s
.
additional
human
coronavirus
strains
will
very
likely
be
discovered
,
which
stresses
the
need
for
further
investigation
into
the
virology
and
etiology
of
these
infectious
organisms.question
:
what
is
the
actual
clinical
impact
of
coronaviruses
on
infectious
disease
prevalence
and
severity
in
the
child
and
adult
population
?
kenneth
mcintosh
,
md
:
coronaviruses
are
common
,
and
they
are
generally
related
to
the
upper
respiratory
tract
family
of
disorders
.
they
also
trigger
asthma
in
children
and
adults
and
severe
respiratory
disease
in
the
elderly
.
under
the
bell-shaped
curve
of
respiratory
infection
,
they
probably
cause
pneumonia
and
bronchiolitis
infections
in
the
infant
and
child
population
.
the
clinical
impact
of
coronaviruses
has
not
yet
been
fully
determined
because
much
still
remains
to
be
discovered
,
despite
recent
research
advances.question
:
overwhelmingly
sars
seemed
to
have
its
greatest
problems
in
the
adult
population
,
which
probably
has
a
lot
to
do
with
how
it
entered
the
human
population
and
was
spread
.
did
sars
present
to
be
as
much
of
a
problem
for
babies
and
children
?
kenneth
mcintosh
,
md
:
no
,
interestingly
enough
sars
did
not
seem
to
be
as
much
of
a
threat
to
infants
and
children
.
the
infection
appeared
to
be
less
severe
in
babies
,
and
babies
were
also
less
infectious
.
this
was
evident
by
looking
at
the
trend
of
secondary
cases
that
developed
.
this
is
in
marked
contrast
to
the
age-related
severity
of
most
respiratory
viral
infections
.
these
data
have
provoked
considerable
interest
and
discussion
,
but
no
good
explanation
has
surfaced
.
my
own
theory
relates
to
the
fact
that
almost
all
respiratory
viral
infections
in
adults
are
reinfections
,
and
these
occur
on
a
background
of
partial
immunity
.
theoretically
,
if
you
took
a
virus
like
rsv
or
parainfluenza
and
introduced
it
for
the
first
time
into
the
human
population
,
adults
,
who
are
infected
and
have
no
preexisting
immunity
,
might
develop
more
severe
disease
than
babies
.
however
,
until
further
research
can
verify
this
,
it
can
only
be
seen
as
a
theory.strain

,
in
recent
years
two
randomized

might
play
in

talk

”
news
headlines
and
health
experts
on
social
media
are
sounding
the
alarm
over
another
variant
of
the
coronavirus
,
this
time
delta
,
claiming
it
is
much
more
contagious
and
perhaps
more
lethal
than
any
other
variant
seen
so
far
.
it
’
s
easy
to
understand
why
:
new
variants
of
the
virus
continue
to
emerge
,
and
cases
are
rising
in
many
countries
.
but
whether
new
variants
pose
a
unique
or
substantial
risk
is
still
unknown
,
and
as
virologists
,
we
are
concerned
that
misunderstanding
variants
and
the
risk
they
pose
can
cause
confusion
and
panic.as
the
coronavirus
spread
globally
,
its
genome
changed
—
mutated
—
as
expected
for
any
virus
.
these
mutations
may
affect
the
virus
’
s
“
fitness
,
”
its
ability
to
reproduce
and
spread
.
some
mutations
weaken
a
virus
,
some
have
no
measurable
effect
,
and
some
make
it
stronger.as
a
virus
becomes
more
fit
,
it
will
outcompete
less
fit
viruses
—
and
delta
is
not
the
first
variant
that
has
beat
its
predecessors
and
competitors
in
certain
areas
.
there
’
s
the
alpha
variant
that
first
became
dominant
in
britain
,
and
the
gamma
variant
that
first
became
dominant
in
brazil
.
such
changes
are
not
unique
to
the
coronavirus
.
increased
viral
fitness
happens
during
every
flu
season
and
is
why
some
flu
variants
may
circulate
more
widely
than
others.just
because
a
variant
displaces
another
does
not
necessarily
mean
it
is
more
infectious
or
more
deadly
to
the
people
who
become
infected
with
it
.
as
has
been
true
for
the
past
year
and
a
half
,
human
behavior
is
far
more
important
in
shaping
the
course
of
the
pandemic
than
any
variant.there
are
many
ways
that
a
virus
can
mutate
to
increase
its
fitness
.
while
there
’
s
been
much
focus
on
changes
in
the
virus
’
s
spike
proteins
,
which
allow
the
coronavirus
to
invade
cells
,
a
virus
can
also
sustain
changes
in
other
proteins
.
such
changes
can
allow
the
virus
to
replicate
more
easily
or
evade
the
immune
system
,
for
example
.
they
may
even
allow
the
virus
to
persist
longer
in
nasal
passages.determining
what
impact
a
given
mutation
has
requires
substantial
laboratory
research
.
sometimes
,
early
conclusions
about
a
particular
mutation
can
be
incorrect
.
when
the
first
variant
of
note
,
d614g
,
emerged
last
winter
,
some
scientists
believed
changes
to
the
virus
’
s
spike
protein
made
the
virus
more
contagious
.
but
subsequent
research
showed
that
was
not
the
case
.
even
so
,
each
time
a
new
change
in
the
spike
protein
is
identified
,
many
experts
presume
the
variant
is
more
virulent
and
“
of
concern.
”
but
whether
any
variant
is
biologically
more
transmissible
or
causes
more
severe
illness
has
not
been
rigorously
tested.right
now
,
conclusions
about
variant
transmissibility
are
based
largely
on
how
widespread
the
variant
is
.
a
variant
might
be
deemed
more
contagious
because
it
makes
up
a
higher
proportion
of
new
infections
.
delta
is
now
the
most
common
variant
in
india
and
britain
,
accounting
for
more
than
90
percent
of
new
cases
,
and
over
20
percent
of
new
infections
in
the
united
states
.
not
all
virologists
,
including
us
,
agree
that
measurements
like
this
are
sufficient
to
declare
a
variant
more
transmissible
or
more
contagious
.
what
’
s
clear
is
delta
may
be
the
fitter
and
dominant
variant
for
now.to
determine
increased
transmissibility
,
the
ability
of
the
virus
to
be
passed
on
from
one
person
to
another
,
requires
more
than
measuring
infection
rates
.
it
may
require
experiments
in
people
,
which
are
unethical
to
conduct.changes
in
people
’
s
activities
contribute
to
the
rise
of
infections
—
such
as
travel
,
failure
to
mask
and
to
adhere
to
physical
distancing
policies
,
and
most
important
right
now
,
insufficient
vaccination
—
and
these
are
often
not
considered
in
public
discussion
of
variants.the
huge
infection
numbers
in
india
,
nigeria
and
other
places
are
not
necessarily
because
of
a
particular
variant
,
but
in
large
part
because
of
breached
containment
measures
and
crowded
populations
with
poor
public
health
infrastructures
.
if
people
are
in
situations
in
which
they
can
be
infected
with
the
coronavirus
,
it
’
s
highly
likely
they
will
be
infected
with
the
fittest
variant
in
the
area
.
right
now
,
in
many
places
,
that
’
s
delta.what
’
s
important
to
understand
is
that
people
infected
with
the
variants
do
not
necessarily
develop
more
severe
disease
or
die
more
frequently
from
the
coronavirus
,
and
it
is
essential
to
get
vaccinated.the
coronavirus
vaccines
that
have
been
developed
are
very
effective
in
preventing
severe
disease
and
death
caused
by
all
variants
,
including
delta
.
vaccines
might
not
always
prevent
infections
,
but
they
make
a
substantial
impact
in
reducing
virus
spread
and
risk
for
serious
health
problems
.
people
who
are
unvaccinated
are
at
a
great
risk
for
infection
and
harm
from
any
variant
of
the
coronavirus.during
a
pandemic
,
a
time
of
unknowns
,
people
want
immediate
answers
to
the
question
,
what
does
this
mutation
mean
?
providing
the
correct
answers
may
require
years
of
research
.
for
now
,
there

little
evidence
that
the

is
on
an
endless
trajectory
of
increased
transmission

virulence

still
end

picking
up

have
started

to

about

big
on

committing
to
buying
millions
of
doses
even
before
a
vaccine
was
approved
.
now
,
about
44
percent
of
the
united

population
has
been
fully
vaccinated
,
far
more
than
many
other
countries
.
while
other
nations
struggle
to
obtain
vaccines
needed
to
stop
outbreaks
,
the
united

has
a
surplus
,
and
is
experiencing
the
fewest
cases
,
hospitalizations
and
deaths
since
the
beginning
of
the
pandemic.yet
for
all
of
the
american
successes
,
100,000
people
have
died
from

after

asked
more
than
a
dozen
public
health
experts
,
economists

bioethicists
to
reflect
on
the
vaccine

.
was
the
american
approach
as
effective
as
it
could
have
been
?
what
,
if
anything
,
could
have
been
done
differently
?
the
trump
and
biden
administrations
debated
numerous
options
,
including
ideas
raised
by
the
experts
.
there
is
by
no
means
universal
agreement
about
what
should
have
been
done
,
and
no
way
of
knowing
with
certainty
whether
different
vaccination
tactics
would
have
resulted
in
fewer
deaths
.
still
,
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight
,
experts
pointed
to
several
areas
where
the
united
states
might
have
taken
another
approach
.
here
are
five
alternate
scenarios
:
by
now
,
most
people
are
familiar
with
the
pfizer
and
moderna
timelines
:
an
initial
dose
of
the
vaccine
,
followed
by
a
second
shot
three
to
four
weeks
later.some
experts
suggest
that
the
united
states
could
have
delayed
second
doses
of
the
vaccine
for
several
weeks
and
instead
given
out
first
shots
more
widely
to
high
risk
people
,
in
order
to
give
some
protection
to
more
people
.
one
dose
of
the
pfizer
or
moderna
vaccine
offers
80
percent
protection
after
two
weeks
,
compared
with
90
percent
from
two
doses
,
according
to
a
federal
report
on
efficacy
under
real
world
conditions
.
(
the
johnson
&
johnson
vaccine
,
which
was
authorized
later
,
comes
in
a
single
shot
.
)
“
we
spent
a
lot
of
february
providing
a
lot
of
second
shots
to
people
who
had
gotten
their
first
shot
in
january
,
when
there
were
a
ton
of
high
risk
people
getting
infected
and
dying
,
for
whom
a
single
shot
would
have
made
a
big
difference
,
”
said
dr.
ashish
jha
,
dean
of
the
brown
university
school
of
public
health.the
delayed
shot
approach
,
which
had
not
been
rigorously
tested
,
particularly
over
time
and
against
virus
variants
,
was
hotly
debated
.
federal
officials
ultimately
deemed
it
too
risky
,
and
dr.
anthony
s.
fauci
,
america
’
s
top
infectious
disease
expert
,
said
he
was
opposed.the
approach
,
though
experimental
,
was
used
in
britain
,
where
officials
delayed
second
shots
by
up
to
12
weeks
.
(
britain
also
organized
its
rollout
largely
by
age
,
starting
with
the
oldest
most
likely
to
die
from
the
virus
and
continuing
in
descending
order
.
)
deaths
in
britain
have
plummeted
—
the
country
recently
recorded
a
day
with
zero
new
deaths
—
and
a
recent
study
reported
an
intriguing
finding
:
people
who
received
the
second
shot
12
weeks
later
actually
produced
more
antibodies
than
those
who
received
their
second
shot
after
three
weeks
.
still
,
britain
has
seen
a
rise
in
cases
in
recent
weeks
and
is
now
accelerating
second
doses
in
order
to
combat
an
outbreak
of
the
delta
variant
,
which
is
more
contagious
and
more
likely
to
infect
people
who
have
had
only
one
shot
.
some
people
have
argued
that
the
nation
should
have
prioritized
people
who
were
most
likely
to
spread
the
virus
,
rather
than
those
most
vulnerable
to
dying
from
it
.
(
indonesia
tried
vaccinating
younger
people
first
.
)
but
the
experts
we
spoke
with
generally
said
that
the
united
states
was
wise
to
prioritize
older
people
,
who
have
died
from
covid
at
much
higher
rates
.
“
if
our
goal
is
to
save
the
most
lives
,
we
need
to
think
about
who
is
most
likely
to
die
,
”
said
nancy
jecker
,
a
professor
of
bioethics
at
the
university
of
washington
school
of
medicine
.
“
age
is
a
pretty
reliable
predictor.
”
indeed
,
since
vaccinations
began
,
deaths
among
people
75
and
older
have
fallen
substantially
,
with
particular
progress
in
nursing
homes.while
doses
were
initially
in
short
supply
and
many
seniors
faced
problems
accessing
the
vaccine
,
some
experts
said
opening
shots
to
a
slightly
wider
group
could
have
brought
equity
,
arguing
that
higher
age
cutoffs
benefited
white
americans
,
who
have
a
longer
life
expectancy
than
their
black
peers
.
when
states
opened
up
eligibility
to
the
general
population
,
some
began
with
a
threshold
of
75
or
80
,
while
many
went
with
a
cutoff
of
65
and
older
.
“
even
at
the
beginning
,
we
should
have
started
at
60
and
above
,
or
65
and
above
at
least
,
”
said
saad
omer
,
director
of
the
yale
institute
for
global
health.in
recent
months
,
people
aged
50
to
64

made
up
a

slightly
younger

the

area
in

short.across

should
have
pushed
for
a
more
direct
approach
,
such
as
targeting
disadvantaged
areas
,
a
tactic
that
was
tried
in
a
limited
number
of
places
.
“

’
”
one
data
analysis
by
researchers
at
the
university
of
texas
at
austin
suggests
that
it
would
have
been
possible
to
save

by
targeting

of

their

,
further
complicating
a

already
marred
by

4.1
million
brazilians

as
of

,

researchers
who
are
following

this
represents
nearly
16
percent
of
those
eligible
for
a
second
dose.the
reasons
for
people
missing
their
second
dose
are
varied
,
but
experts
warn
that
a
large
number
of
people
with
only
partial
protection
could
set
back
brazil
’
s
already
troubled
vaccination
effort
.
the
coronavirus
has
killed
more
than
500,000
people
in

specialist
at

one
of
the
researchers
leading
the
study
of

.
“
and
cases
will
not
fall
in
the
meantime.
”
one
reason
that
so
many
people
have
missed
their
second
shot
is
brazil
’
s
chaotic
vaccination
rollout
,
dr.
bahia
said
.
many
local
and
state
authorities
opened
up
immunizations
too
quickly
to
groups
that
were
not
at
high
risk
for
infection
,
when
not
enough
doses
were
available
,
she
said.
“
the
euphoria
of
the
vaccination
is
not
in
line
with
the
reality
of
the
supply
,
”
she
said
.
“
they
wanted
to
speed
up
,
to
say
,
‘
we
’
re
vaccinating
!
’
but
some
people
were
left
behind.
”
brazil
has
manufactured
much
of
its
vaccine
supply
domestically
,
using
materials
shipped
from
china
to
churn
out
the
coronavac
vaccine
developed
by
the
chinese
company
sinovac
biotech
.
in
march
,
brazil
’
s
health
ministry
released
supplies
that
it
had
initially
planned
to
reserve
as
second
doses
for
priority
groups
,
such
as
health
workers
,
older
people
and
those
with
pre-existing
illnesses.soon
after
that
,
delays
in
shipments
from
china
badly
curbed
supplies
,
just
as
more
people
in
brazil
were
due
to
receive
their
second
doses.
“
some
people
didn
’
t
get
their
second
dose
because
they
searched
and
searched
—
and
eventually
gave
up
on
being
vaccinated

society
of

“

others
in
brazil
are
misinformed
,
he
added
,
believing
they
are
protected
after
one
shot
.
health
experts
warn
that
a
single
dose
is
not
enough
,
especially
in
brazil
.
the
country
has
mostly
relied
on
the
vaccine
from
sinovac
,
which
may
not
be
as
effective
as
others
in
preventing
serious
cases
of
covid-19
.
a
study
in
chile
showed
that
sinovac
was
only
36
percent
effective
in
preventing
hospitalizations
after
one
shot
.
hundreds
of
doctors
in
indonesia
who
received
two
sinovac
doses

shots
in

a
march
2021
survey

that
health

workers
had
concerns
about
the

newness
and
their
possible
side
effects
,
both
of
which
are
common
reasons
for
waiting

this

,
dozens
of

of

first
detected

rapidly
in

close
to

they
are
seeing

spread
in
havana

have
been
concentrated
so
far.countries
including
mexico

argentina
,
vietnam
and
iran
have
expressed
interest
in
cuba

the
high
announced
rate
of
efficacy
could
reinforce
hopes
that
biotechnology
exports
will
help
lift
cuba
from
the
depths
of
its
economic
crisis.the
vaccines
made
by
pfizer-biontech
and
moderna
set
off
a
persistent
immune
reaction
in
the
body
that
may
protect
against
the
coronavirus
for
years
,
scientists
reported
on
monday.the
findings
add
to
growing
evidence
that
most
people
immunized
with
the
mrna
vaccines
may
not
need
boosters
,
so
long
as
the
virus
and
its
variants
do
not
evolve
much
beyond
their
current
forms
—
which
is
not
guaranteed
.
people
who
recovered
from
covid-19
before
being
vaccinated
may
not
need
boosters
even
if
the
virus
does
make
a
significant
transformation.
“
it
’
s
a
good
sign
for
how
durable
our
immunity
is
from
this
vaccine
,
”
said
ali
ellebedy
,
an
immunologist
at
washington
university
in
st.
louis
who
led
the
study
,
which
was
published
in
the
journal
nature.the
study
did
not
consider
the
coronavirus
vaccine
made
by
johnson
&
johnson
,
but
dr.
ellebedy
said
he
expected
the
immune
response
to
be
less
durable
than
that
produced
by
mrna
vaccines.dr
.
ellebedy
and
his
colleagues
reported
last
month
that
in
people
who
survived
covid-19
,
immune
cells
that
recognize
the
virus
lie
quiescent
in
the
bone
marrow
for
at
least
eight
months
after
infection
.
a
study
by
another
team
indicated
that
so-called
memory
b
cells
continue
to
mature
and
strengthen
for
at
least
a
year
after
infection.based
on
those
findings
,
researchers
suggested
that
immunity
might
last
for
years
,
possibly
a
lifetime
,
in
people
who
were
infected
with
the
coronavirus
and
later
vaccinated
.
but
it
was
unclear
whether
vaccination
alone
might
have
a
similarly
long-lasting
effect.dr
.
ellebedy
’
s
team
sought
to
address
that
question
by
looking
at
the
source
of
memory
cells
:
the
lymph
nodes
,
where
immune
cells
train
to
recognize
and
fight
the
virus.after
an
infection
or
a
vaccination
,
a
specialized
structure
called
the
germinal
center
forms
in
lymph
nodes
.
this
structure
is
an
elite
school
of
sorts
for
b
cells
—
a
boot
camp
where
they
become
increasingly
sophisticated
and
learn
to
recognize
a
diverse
set
of
viral
genetic
sequences.the
broader
the
range
and
the
longer
these
cells
have
to
practice
,
the
more
likely
they
are
to
be
able
to
thwart
variants
of
the
virus
that
may
emerge.
“
everyone
always
focuses
on
the
virus
evolving
—
this
is
showing
that
the
b
cells
are
doing
the
same
thing
,
”
said
marion
pepper
,
an
immunologist
at
the
university
of
washington
in
seattle
.
“
and
it
’
s
going
to
be
protective
against
ongoing
evolution
of
the
virus
,
which
is
really
encouraging.
”
after
infection
with
the
coronavirus
,
the
germinal
center

but
after
vaccination
,
the
cells
’
education
takes
place
in
lymph
nodes
in
the
armpits
,
within
reach
of
researchers.dr
.
ellebedy
and
his
colleagues
recruited
41
people
—
including
eight
with
a
history
of
infection
with
the
virus
—
who
were
immunized
with
two
doses
of
the
pfizer-biontech
vaccine
.
from
14
of
these
people
,
the
team
extracted
samples
from
the
lymph
nodes
at
three
,
four
,
five
,
seven
and
15
weeks
after
the
first
dose.that
painstaking
work
makes
this
a
“
heroic
study
,
”
said
akiko
iwasaki
,
an
immunologist
at
yale
.
“
this
kind
of
careful
time-course
analysis
in
humans
is
very
difficult
to
do.
”
dr
.
ellebedy
’
s
team
found
that
15
weeks
after
the
first
dose
of
vaccine
,
the
germinal
center
was
still
highly
active
in
all
14
of
the
participants
,
and
that
the
number
of
memory
cells
that
recognized
the
coronavirus
had
not
declined.
“
the
fact
that
the
reactions
continued
for
almost
four
months
after
vaccination
—
that
’
s
a
very
,
very
good
sign
,
”
dr.
ellebedy
said
.
germinal
centers
typically
peak
one
to
two
weeks
after
immunization
,
and
then
wane.
“
usually
by
four
to
six
weeks
,
there
’
s
not
much
left
,
”
said
deepta
bhattacharya
,
an
immunologist
at
the
university
of
arizona
.
but
germinal
centers
stimulated
by
the
mrna
vaccines
are
“
still
going
,
months
into
it
,
and
not
a
lot
of
decline
in
most
people.
”
dr
.
bhattacharya
noted
that
most
of
what
scientists
know
about
the
persistence
of
germinal
centers
is
based
on
animal
research
.
the
new
study
is
the
first
to
show
what
happens
in
people
after
vaccination.the
results
suggest
that
a
vast
majority
of
vaccinated
people
will
be
protected
over
the
long
term
—
at
least
,
against
the
existing
coronavirus
variants
.
but
older
adults
,
people
with
weak
immune
systems
and
those
who
take
drugs
that
suppress
immunity
may
need
boosters
;
people
who
survived
covid-19
and
were
later
immunized
may
never
need
them
at
all.exactly
how
long
the
protection
from
mrna
vaccines
will
last
is
hard
to
predict
.
in
the
absence
of
variants
that
sidestep
immunity
,
in
theory
immunity
could
last
a
lifetime
,
experts
said
.
but
the
virus
is
clearly
evolving.
“
anything
that
would
actually
require
a
booster
would
be
variant-based
,
not
based
on
waning
of
immunity
,
”
dr.
bhattacharya
said
.
“
i
just
don
’
t
see
that
happening.
”
people
who
were
infected
with
the
coronavirus
and
then
immunized
see
a
major
boost
in
their
antibody
levels
,
most
likely
because
their
memory
b
cells
—
which
produce
antibodies
—
had
many
months
to
evolve
before
vaccination.the
good
news
:
a
booster
vaccine
will
probably
have
the
same
effect
as
prior
infection
in
immunized
people
,
dr.
ellebedy
said
.
“
if
you
give
them
another
chance
to
engage
,
they
will
have
a
massive
response
,
”
he
said
,
referring
to
memory
b
cells.in
terms
of
bolstering
the
immune
system
,
vaccination
is
“
probably
better
”
than
recovering
from
the
actual
infection
,
he
said
.
other
studies
have
suggested
that
the
repertoire
of
memory
b
cells
produced
after
vaccination
is
more
diverse
than
that
generated
by
infection
,
suggesting
that
the
vaccines
will
protect
better
against
variants
than
natural
immunity
alone.dr
.
ellebedy
said
the
results
also
suggested
that
these
signs
of
persistent
immune
reaction
might
be
caused
by
mrna
vaccines
alone
,
as
opposed
to
those
made
by
more
traditional
means
,
like
johnson
&
johnson
’
s.but
that
is
an
unfair
comparison
,
because
the
johnson
&
johnson
vaccine
is
given
as
a
single
dose
,
dr.
iwasaki
said
:
“
if
the
j
&
j
had
a
booster
,
maybe
it
will
induce
this
same
kind
of
response.
”
with
all
american
adults
now
eligible
for
covid-19
vaccines
and
businesses
and
international
borders
reopening
,
a
fierce
debate
has
kicked
off
across
the
united
states
over
whether
a
digital
health
certificate
(
often
and
somewhat
misleadingly
called
a
“
vaccine
passport
”
)
should
be
required
to
prove
immunization
status.currently
,
americans
are
issued
a
white
paper
card
as
evidence
of
their
covid-19
shots
,
but
these
can
easily
be
forged
,
and
online
scammers
are
already
selling
false
and
stolen
vaccine
cards.while
the
federal
government
has
said
it
will
not
introduce
digital
vaccine
passports
by
federal
mandate
,
a
growing
number
of
businesses
—
from
cruise
lines
to
sports
venues
—
say
they
will
require
proof
of
vaccinations
for
entry
or
services
.
hundreds
of
digital
health
pass
initiatives
are
scrambling
to
launch
apps
that
provide
a
verified
electronic
record
of
immunizations
and
negative
coronavirus
test
results
to
streamline
the
process.the
drive
has
raised
privacy
and
equity
concerns
and
some
states
like
florida
and
texas
have
banned
businesses
from
requiring
vaccination
certificates
.

developers
argue
that
the
digital
infrastructure
is
secure
and
will
help
speed
up
the
process
of
reopening
society
and
reviving

,
technology
companies

other
businesses
are
testing
different
versions
of

are
trying
to
come
up
with
common
standards
so
that
there
is
compatibility
between
each
system
and
health
records
can
be
pulled
in
a
safe
and
controlled
format.the
process
comes
with
great
technical
challenges
,
especially
because
of
the
sheer
number
of
app
initiatives
underway

for
the
certificates
to
be
useful
,
countries
,
airlines

must
agree
on

the
infrastructure
they
use
will
need
to
be
compatible
.
in
the

there
is
an
added
complexity
of
getting
individual
states
to
share
immunization
data
with
different
certificate
platforms
while
maintaining
the
privacy
of
residents.here

what
we
know
about
the
current
status
of
digital
health
passes
and
some
of
the
roadblocks
they
are
facing
in
the
united
states.in
march
,
new
york
became
the
first
state
in
the
united
states
to
launch
a
digital
health
certificate
called
excelsior
pass
,
which
verifies
a
person
’
s
negative
coronavirus
test
result
and
if
they
are
fully
vaccinated.the
app
and
website
,
which
has
now
had
more
than
one
million
downloads
,
is
free
and
voluntary
for
all
new

,
and
provides
a
qr
code
that
can
be
scanned
or
printed
out
to
verify
a
person

.
the
pass
has
been
used
by
thousands
of
new
yorkers
to
enter
yankee
stadium
,
madison
square
garden
and
other
smaller
public

businesses
require
people
to
show
their

along
with
their
excelsior
pass
to
prevent
potential
fraud.in
israel
,
where
more

residents
must
show
an
electronic
“
green

”
to
attend
places
such
as
gyms
,
concerts
,
wedding
halls
and
to
dine
indoors
.
the
european
union
has
endorsed
an
electronic
vaccine
certificate
to
be
recognized
from
july
1
,
which
a
number
of
european
countries
have
begun
using
,
but
each
individual
member
country
will
be
able
to
set
its
own
rules
for
travel
requirements
.
britain
has
also
started
testing
a
covid-19
certificate
system
that
aims
to
help
businesses
reopen
safely.some
airlines
including
lufthansa
,
virgin
atlantic
and

to
use

by
more
than
20
airlines

depends
on
state
regulations
.
the
biden

has
said
there

be
no

individual
states
hold
primary
public

the
authority
to

“
we
expect
a

”
in
april
,
gov
.
greg
abbott
of
texas
issued
an
executive
order
banning

institutions
that
receive
state
funding
from
requiring
people
to
show
proof
that
they
have
been
vaccinated
against
the
coronavirus.ron
desantis
,
the
florida
governor
,
issued
a
similar
order
,
saying
that
requiring
proof
of
vaccination
would
“
reduce
individual
freedom
”
and
“
harm
patient
privacy
”
as
well
as
“
create
two
classes
of
citizens
based
on
vaccinations.
”
but
those
orders
may
not
stick
.
“
the
governors
are
on
shaky
legal
ground

the
director
of
the
o

neill
institute
for
national
and
global
health
law
at
georgetown
university

“
certainly
,
the
legislature
has
authority
to
regulate
businesses
in
the
state
,
and
it
can
also
pre-empt
counties
and
local
governments
from
issuing
vaccine
passports
.
but
a
governor
,
acting
on
his
or
her
own
,
has
no
inherent
power
to
regulate
businesses
other
than
through
emergency
or
other
health
powers
that
the
legislature
gives
them.
”
in
the
united
states
,
there
is
no
centralized
federal
vaccine
database
.
instead
,
the
states
collect
that
information
.
all
states
except
new
hampshire
have
their
own
immunization
registries
and
some
cities
,
like
new
york
,
have
their
own.currently
states
are
required
to
share
their
registries
with
the
centers
for
disease
control
and
prevention
,
but
the
data
is
not
public
and
could
be
withheld.that
means
anyone
developing
a
digital
vaccine
certificate
in
the
united
states
would
have
to
obtain
immunization
data
from
individual
states
,
which
could
be
problematic
in
states
that
oppose
health
pass
initiatives.one
of
the
issues
is
with
terminology
.
a
passport
is
issued
by
a
government
and
certifies
personal
data
including
a
person
’
s
legal
name
and
date
of
birth
.
many
people
fear
that
if
they
are
required
to
have
one
related
to
the
coronavirus
,
they
will
be
handing
over
personal
and
sensitive
health
data
to
private
companies
that
could
be
stolen
or
used
for
other
purposes.
“
there
are
a
whole
lot
of
valid
concerns
about
how
privacy
and
technology
would
work
with
these
systems
,
especially
as
silicon
valley
does
not
have
a
great
history
delivering
technologies
that
are
privacy
enhancing
,
”
said
brian
behlendorf
,
executive
director
of
linux
foundation
public
health
,
an
open-source
,
technology-focused
organization.
“
and
the
concept
of
privacy
here
is
complicated
because
you
are
ultimately
trying
to
prove
to
somebody
that
you
received
something
,
”
he
said
.
“
you
aren
’
t
keeping
a
secret
,
so
the
challenge
is
to
present
and
prove
something
without
creating
a
chain
of
traceability
forever
that
might
be
used.
”
the
linux
foundation
is
working
with
a
network
of
technology
companies
called
the
covid-19
credentials
initiative
to
develop
a
set
of
standards
for
preserving
privacy
in
the
use
of
vaccine
certificates
.
the
main
aim
of
the
initiative
is
to
establish
a
verifiable
credential
(
much
like
a
card
in
one
’
s
wallet
)
that
contains
a
set
of
claims
about
an
individual
but
is
digitally
native
and
cryptographically
secure.some
argue
that
such
a
credential
would
intrude
on
personal
freedoms
and
private
health
choices.
“
‘
vaccine
passports
’
must
be
stopped
,
”
former
representative
ron
paul
of
texas
wrote
in
a
tweet
last
week
.
“
accepting
them
means
accepting
the
false
idea
that
government
owns
your
life
,
body
and
freedom.
”
others
worry
that
an
exclusively
digital
system
would
leave
some
communities
behind
,
especially
those
who
do
not
have
access
to
smartphones
or
the
internet.
“
any
solutions
in
this
area
should
be
simple

free

persuading

health
organization
as
saying
that
vaccination
rates
in
certain
countries
had
not
reached
sufficient
levels
to
prevent
outbreaks
,
and
that
countries
needed
to
continue
to
maintain
controls.
“
relevant
reports
and
data
also
show
that
many
countries
that
use
chinese-made
vaccines
have
expressed
that
they
are
safe
and
reliable
,
and
have
played
a
good
role
in
their
epidemic
prevention
efforts
,
”
the
ministry
said
.
china
has
also
emphasized
that
its
vaccines
target
severe
disease
rather
than
transmission.no
vaccine
fully
prevents
transmission
,
and
people
can
still
fall
ill
after
being
inoculated
,
but
the
relatively
low
efficacy
rates
of
chinese
shots
have
been
identified
as
a
possible
cause
of
the
recent
outbreaks.the
pfizer-biontech
and
moderna
vaccines
have
efficacy
rates
of
more
than
90
percent
.
a
variety
of
other
vaccines
—
including
astrazeneca
and
johnson
&
johnson
—
have
efficacy
rates
of
around
70
percent
.
the
sinopharm
vaccine
developed
with
the
beijing
institute
of
biological
products
has
an
efficacy
rate
of
78.1
percent
;
the
sinovac
vaccine
has
an
efficacy
rate
of
51

companies

on
monday
,
shao
yiming
,
an
epidemiologist
with

chinese
center

was
less
effective
than
those
from

preventing

individuals.a

medical
director

the
efficacy
rates
of

could
be
low
enough
“
to
sustain
some

well

largely
out

”
despite
the
spike
in
cases
,
officials
in
both
the
seychelles
and
mongolia
have
defended
sinopharm
,
saying
it
is
effective
in
preventing
severe
cases
of
the
disease.batbayar
ochirbat
,
head
researcher
of
the
scientific
advisory
group
for
emergencies
at
mongolia
’
s
ministry
of
health
,
said
mongolia
had
made
the
right
decision
to
go
with
the
chinese-made
shot
,
in
part
because
it
had
helped
keep
the
mortality
rate
low
in
the
country
.
data
from
mongolia
showed
that
the
sinopharm
vaccine
was
actually
more
protective
than
the
doses
developed
by
astrazeneca
and
sputnik
,
a
russian
vaccine
,
according
to
the
health
ministry.the
reason
for
the
surge
in
mongolia
,
mr.
batbayar
said
,
is
that
the
country
reopened
too
quickly
,
and
many
people
believed
they
were
protected
after
only
one
dose.
“
i
think
you
could
say
mongolians
celebrated
too
early
,
”
he
said
.
“
my
advice
is
the
celebrations
should
start
after
the
full
vaccinations
,
so
this
is
the
lesson
learned
.
there
was
too
much
confidence.
”
some
health
officials
and
scientists
are
less
confident.nikolai
petrovsky
,
a
professor
at
the
college
of
medicine
and
public
health
at
flinders
university
in
australia
,
said
that
with
all
of
the
evidence
,
it
would
be
reasonable
to
assume
the
sinopharm
vaccine
had
minimal
effect
on
curbing
transmission
.
a
major
risk
with
the
chinese
inoculation
is
that
vaccinated
people
may
have
few
or
no
symptoms
and
still
spread
the
virus
to
others
,
he
said.
“
i
think
that
this
complexity
has
been
lost
on

decision
makers

the

relief

but
parts
of

vaccination

even
counties.any
risk

loss

is
almost
entirely
preventable
,
given

and
yet
there
’

reason
to
believe
that
the
plateauing

cause
the
nation
to
fall
short

that
’
s
despite
the
fact
that
an
overwhelming
majority
of
covid-19
deaths
are
among
the
unvaccinated.so
,
what
happens
now
?
there
’
s
no
reason
the
united
states
should
settle
for
patchwork
vaccination
rates
and
easily
preventable
death
.
there
are
ways
to
overcome
low
vaccine
demand
.
it
starts
with
doctors
and
nurses.twenty
years
of
research
on
how
to
persuade
people
to
get
vaccinated
shows
that
health
care
providers
are
the
most
trusted
source
of
vaccine
information
,
even
among
vaccine
refusers
.
the
nation
’
s
doctors
and
nurses
need
to
talk
to
patients
about
covid-19
vaccines
at
every
opportunity.this
may
seem
obvious
,
and
yet
very
few
providers
have
been
trained
in
the
most
effective
approaches
for
talking
to
people
about
vaccines.for
example
,
doctors
and
nurses
may
assume
they
need
to
offer
patients
more
information
about
the
vaccines
in
order
to
persuade
them
.
but
research
shows
that
often
a
lack
of
knowledge
is
not
the
main
problem
.
many
people
refuse
vaccines
because
of
their
worldview
,
values
or
mistrust
of
the
health
system
.
while
people
on
the
fence
about
vaccination
may
have
needed
more
information
to
help
make
up
their
mind
early
on
,
at
this
stage
,
there
’
s
information
overload.strategies
like
framing
vaccination
as
the
default
choice
—
“
it
’
s
time
for
you
to
get
vaccinated
,
”
versus
,
“
maybe
you
should
think
about
receiving
the
covid
vaccine
”
—
can
be
effective
.
it
doesn
’
t
take
away
someone
’
s
autonomy
,
but
still
serves
as
a
verbal
nudge
toward
vaccination.but
how
can
the
nation
ensure
that
its
doctors
use
these
approaches
?
there
needs
to
be
a
continuing
medical
education
program
—
a
tool
used
by
physicians
to
keep
their
skills
and
knowledge
of
medicine
up-to-date
and
to
maintain
their
license
—
to
train
them
in
effective
vaccine
communication
techniques
.
we
recently
started
such
a
program
at
yale.another
way
to
ensure
that
health
care
providers
spend
sufficient
time
on
sometimes
challenging
conversations
about
vaccines
is
to
make
vaccine
counseling
reimbursable
.
right
now
,
providers
are
compensated
if
they
vaccinate
their
patient
;
they
don
’
t
get
reimbursed
if
the
patient
ends
up
refusing
the
vaccine.but
doctors
don
’
t
always
know
if
their
conversations
with
patients
persuaded
them
to
be
vaccinated
or
not
.
they
should
be
compensated
for
having
the
conversation
in
the
first
place
.
many
other
countries
do
so
.
for
example
,
australia
recently
instituted
rebates
for
general
practitioners
who
provide
counseling
on
covid-19
vaccines.persuading
people
to
get
vaccinated
often
requires
multiple
discussions
.
ideally
,
as
part
of
any
appointment
,
physicians
will
urge
unvaccinated
patients
to
get
the
covid-19
vaccine
,
and
talk
through
any
concerns
.
if
the
physician
does
so
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
(
e.g.
,
more
than
three
minutes
,
similar
to
the
threshold
for
reimbursing
physicians
for
smoking
cessation
counseling
)
,
the
doctor
can
seek
reimbursement
.
physicians
should
be
able
to
bill
for
multiple
counseling
sessions
with
the
same
patient
up
to
a
reasonable
limit
of
three
times
per
year.other
continuing
efforts
,
such
as
increasing
vaccine
access
and
making
the
vaccination
process
simple
,
remain
important
.
to
this
day
,
there
are
many
people
who
are
concerned
about
the
cost
of
the
vaccines
even
though
they
are
free
.
vaccination
sites
should
stop
asking
for
insurance
information.the
most
effective
vaccine
message
is
one
that
comes
from
a
trusted
source
and
not
only
leads
the
listeners
to
get
vaccinated
but
also
motivates
them
to
encourage
others
around
them
to
do
so
as
well
.
this
is
what
we
need
,
as
people
become
complacent
with
the
benefits
of
others
getting
vaccinated
.
health
care
providers
hold
this
sway
,
and
all
health
workers
need
to
push
toward
higher
vaccination
rates
together.morgan

new

as

gasped
for

at
the
peak
of
its

devastation

its

appeared
to
advise
his

normally.the

a

of

came
from
one
of

accounts
of

,
who
has
used
powerful
oratory
and
digital
savvy
to
become
india

most
dominant

in

but
the

showed
how
india

master
of

has
increasingly
struggled
to
get
his
message
across
,
exposing
the
limits
of
his
ability
to
control
the
narrative.the
omnipresent
mr.

had
largely
vanished
from
public
view
as
his
government
proved
powerless
to
stop
the
deaths
and
the
mounting
criticism
about
his
performance
.
with
his

numbers
dropping

his

straining
to
make

on

he
and

responded
one

:
“
this
is

”
in
turn
,
mr.

has
tried
to
quash
dissent
.
his
government
has
been
locked
in
a
messy
showdown
with
social
media
platforms
over
taking
down
critical
content
.
the
police
in
delhi
,
the
capital
,
arrested
at
least
20
people
for
putting
up
posters
critical
of
mr.

a

threatened
those
who
complained
about
oxygen
shortages.on
monday
,
as
india
’
s
official
death
and
infection
figures
were
falling
,
mr.
modi
tried
to
seize
the
moment
and
change
the
narrative
.
in
a
rare
televised
address
since
the
second
wave
began
in
april
,
he
declared
that
the
central
government
would
help
all
900
million
adults
get
free
vaccines
,
a
reversal
of
his
earlier
policy
that
had
forced
state
governments
into
a
chaotic
competition
over
limited
supplies
.
a
spokesman
said
mr.
modi
had
been
too
busy
with
“
silent
work
and
work
and
work
”
to
appear
in
public
during
the
pandemic.mr
.
modi
’
s
positivity
push
appears
to
be
an
attempt
to
drown
out
dissatisfaction
.
one
survey
found
disapproval
with
mr.
modi
rising
by
about
10
percentage
points
since
the
second
wave
intensified
.
in
another
survey
,
one
in
six
people
said
they
had
lost
a
loved
one
and
blamed
the
central
government
first
,
and
then
“
destiny
,
”
for
their
loss.
“
so
much
death
,
so
much
despair
—
children
lost
their
parents
overnight
,

lost
their
young

“
how
can
we
dare
tell

‘

’
?
”
mr

modi
’
s
approval
rating
is
still
above
60
percent
,
according
to
one
poll
.
but
the
growing
dissatisfaction
suggests
the
prime
minister
may
not
so
easily
be
able
to
change
public
sentiment
by
pushing
emotional
nationalist
causes
or
shifting
his
image
as
he
has
done
in
the
past
.
rather
,
like
any
other
politician
,
he
may
increasingly
be
judged
by
his
ability
to
deliver.
“
there
was
a
template
—
that
if
you
invisibilize
problems
you
do
not
want
to
focus
on
and
convince
the
rest
of
the
population
that
only
the
visible
part
is
the
entire
part

that
seemed
to
work
in

she
said

perhaps
the
most
telling
criticism
has
come
from

”
how
mr.
modi
will
emerge
from
the
pandemic
could
depend
on
those
talents
,
which
have
bailed
him
out
in
the
past.to
become
prime
minister
,
mr.
modi
overcame
a
reputation
tarnished
by
his
alleged
involvement
in
fanning
religious
violence
when
he
was
chief
minister
of
the
state
of
gujarat
two
decades
ago
.
for
a
time
,
he
was
banned
from
entering
the
united
states
on
grounds
that
he
had
violated
religious
freedoms
.
he
successfully
rebranded
himself
as
the
hindu
nationalist
who
could
be
india
’
s
development
champion
.
soon
after
winning
election
in
2014
,
he
traveled
to
new
york
and
spoke
for
an
hour
in
a
packed
madison
square
garden
to
chants
of
“
modi
!
modi
!
modi
!
”
in
seven
years
as
prime
minister
,
he
has
tightly
controlled
his
image
.
he
prefers
choreographed
rallies
and
selective
interviews
over
news
conferences
,
avoiding
vulnerability
while
offering
plenty
of
content
for
his
social
media
apparatus
and
network
of
celebrity
supporters.in
the
face
of
crisis
,
mr.
modi
has
displayed
a
talent
of
inventing
a
new
narrative
and
switching
personas
,
including
combative
national
champion
,
digital
leader
and
spiritual
guide
.
at
times
he
could
seem
deeply
relatable
,
at
others
above
it
all
.
and
he
had
what
the
opposition
lacked
:
an
ability
to
take
his
message
viral.during
the
2019
election
,
with
the
economy
weakening
,
he
emphasized
the
threat
from

before

he
visited

went
to
meditate
in

emphasizing
his
religious
devotion

the
path
was
covered
by

the
most
covid

given

the

may
have
been
partly
because
the

were
widely
available

free
for
the
first
time
to
those
younger

news
reports
have
also
suggested

has
increased
the

about
135
million
doses
are

to
be
available
in

inoculation
drive
relies
almost
entirely
on
two
vaccines
manufactured
in

government
officials
have
said
that
the
companies
behind
those
vaccines
,
the

vaccine
hesitancy

’
s
troubling
new
evidence
that
the

,
could
be
far
more
transmissible
than
even
the
b.1.1.7
variant
,

identified

which
contributed
to
some
of
the
deadliest
surges
around
the
world.in
countries
with
widespread
vaccination
,
like
the

,
we
can
expect
that
covid
cases
,
hospitalizations
and
deaths
will
continue
to
decline
or
stay
low
,
especially
because
lab
tests
and
real

experience
show
that
vaccines
appear
to
defend
recipients
well
against
the
severe
effects
of
both
variants.for
much
of
the
rest
of
the
world
,
though
,
this
even
more
transmissible
new
variant
could
be
catastrophic.the
evidence
is
not
yet
conclusive
because
the
data
is
preliminary
and
figuring
out
if
a
variant
is
more
transmissible
isn
’
t
easy
.
it
could
be
spreading
rapidly
in
an
area
because
of
chance
.
maybe
it
got
there
before
other
variants
and
found
a
susceptible
population
,
or
got
lucky
and
seeded
a
mega-cluster
.
if
a
variant
is
seen
more
frequently
in
a
country
’
s
genomic
databases
it
could
just
be
because
travelers
,
who
are
often
tested
more
routinely
,
are
bringing
it
in
from
another
country
where
it
is
already
dominant.one
key
measure
that
’
s
been
used
in
previous
outbreaks
to
figure
out
if
a
variant
was
more
transmissible
was
to
look
at
“
secondary
attack
rates
”
in
non-travel
settings
—
how
many
people
who
come
into
close
contact
with
an
infected
person
get
the
virus
themselves
.
the
greater
the
number
of
these
contacts
getting
the
virus
,
on
average
,
the
greater
the
likelihood
that
a
variant
’
s
transmissibility
is
greater.data
on
secondary
attack
rates
released
on
saturday
by
a
british
public
health
agency
similar
to
our
own
centers
for
disease
control
and
prevention
suggests
that
this
variant
first
seen
in
india
may
be
substantially
more
transmissible
among
close
contacts
than
even
the
already
highly
transmissible
b.1.1.7
.
a
report
published
by
the
same
agency
on
thursday
further
supports
last
week
’
s
findings
.
it
was
just
such
early
data
that
raised
alarms
about
b.1.1.7
,
with
later
information
confirming
those
early
fears.adam
kucharski
,
an
epidemiologist
with
the
london
school
of
hygiene
and
tropical
medicine
,
also
told
me
that
the
faster
spread
in
areas
of
britain
with
higher
levels
of
the
variant
suggests
it
has
higher
transmissibility
.
this
point
seems
to
be
backed
up
by
the
terrible
outbreaks
in
india
and
neighboring
nepal
,
where
it
is
also
widespread
.
given
how
limited
genetic
identification
is
in
those
countries
,
the
data
from
britain
is
particularly
useful
for
assessing
the
risk.a
variant
with
higher
transmissibility
is
a
huge
danger
to
people
without
immunity
either
from
vaccination
or
prior
infection
,
even
if
the
variant
is
no
more
deadly
than
previous
versions
of
the
virus
.
residents
of
countries
like
taiwan
and
vietnam
that
had
almost
completely
kept
out
the
pandemic
,
and
countries
like
india
and
nepal
that
had
fared
relatively
well
until
recently
,
have
fairly
little
immunity
,
and
are
largely
unvaccinated
.
a
more
transmissible
variant
can
burn
through
such
an
immunologically
naïve
population
very
fast.increased
transmissibility
is
an
exponential
threat
.
if
a
virus
that
could
previously
infect
three
people
on
average
can
now
infect
four
,
it
looks
like
a
small
increase
.
yet
if
you
start
with
just

scenarios

in
total
,

rounds

transmissible
variant
would
cause
2.8
million
cases
,
as
opposed
to
177,000
for
the
less
transmissible
one.morally
and
practically
,
this
emergency
demands
immediate
action
:
widespread
vaccination
of
those
most
vulnerable
where
the
threat
is
greatest.waiving
vaccine
patents
is
fine
,
but
unless
it
’
s
tied
to
a
process
that
actually
increases
the
supply
of
vaccines
,
it
’
s
little
more
than
expressing
thoughts
and
prayers
after
a
tragedy
.
officials
from
all
nations
that
produce
vaccines
need
to
gather
for
an
emergency
meeting
immediately
to
decide
how
to
commandeer
whatever
excess
capacity
they
have
to
produce
more
,
through
whatever
means
necessary
.
because
of
the
threat
of
increased
transmissibility
,
and
since
the
evidence
at
hand
indicates
that
all
of
the
vaccines
,
even
the
chinese
and
russian
versions
,
appear
to
be
highly
effective
against
severe
disease
or
worse
,
the
focus
should
be
on
manufacturing
and
distributing
the
highest
number
of
doses
possible
as
fast
as
possible.if
the
choice
is
between
no
vaccine
and
any
vaccine
,
the
precedence
should
go
to
whatever
can
be
manufactured
fastest
,
regardless
of
patents
,
nation
of
origin
,
or
countries
prioritizing
their
allies
or
wannabe
allies.vaccine
supplies
need
to
be
diverted
now
to
where
the
crisis
is
the
worst
,
if
necessary
away
from
the
wealthy
countries
that
have
purchased
most
of
the
supply
.
it
is
,
of
course
,
understandable
that
every
nation
wants
to
vaccinate
its
own
first
,
but
a
country
with
high
levels
of
vaccination
,
especially
among
its
more
vulnerable
populations
,
can
hold
things
off
,
especially
if
they
also
had
big
outbreaks
before
.
in
addition
,
excess
stockpiles
can
go
where
they
are
needed
without
even
slowing
down
existing
vaccination
programs.right
now
,
covax
,
the
global
alliance
for
vaccine
equity
,
does
not
have
enough
vaccines
to
distribute
,
and
what
supply
it
does
get
is
allocated
according
to
national
population
,
not
the
seriousness
of
outbreaks
.
this
needs
to
change
.
our
fire
department
needs
more
water
,
and
should
direct
it
to
where
the
fire
is
burning
,
not
to
every
house
on
the
street.the
responses
could
vary
.
the
elderly
and
health
care
workers
could
be
prioritized
wherever
a
crisis
is
worst
.
dose-sparing
strategies
could
be
applied
—
delaying
boosters
has
been
successful
in
britain
and
canada
when
they
faced
surges
.
the
details
can
be
decided
by
the
global
health
authorities.if
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
that
the
world
faces
a
mounting
threat
,
it
’
s
best
to
intervene
as
early
and
aggressively
as
possible
,
because
even
a
few
weeks
of
delay
could
make
a
huge
difference
.
waiting
for
definitive
evidence
of
transmissibility
could
allow
the
variant
to
rampage
—
besides
,
if
fears
prove
unfounded
then
the
world
would
still
be
better
off
for
being
more
vaccinated
.
and
any
solution
,
even
if
imperfect
,
is
better
than
waiting
for
the
perfect
setup
or
the
most
conclusive
evidence.as
dr.
kucharski
told
me
,
it
’
s
now
entirely
possible
that
most
covid
deaths
could
occur
after
there
are
enough
vaccines
to
protect
those
most
at
risk
globally
.
britain
had
more
daily
covid-related
deaths
during
the
surge
involving
b.1.1.7
than
in
the
first
wave
,
when
there
was
less
understanding
of
how
to
treat
the
disease
and
far
fewer
therapeutics
that
later
helped
cut
mortality
rates
.
even
after
the
vaccination
campaign
began
,
b.1.1.7
kept
spreading
rapidly
among
the
unvaccinated
.
a
similar
pattern
was
observed
in
much
of
eastern
europe
as
well.even
if
it
is
determined
the
transmissibility
of
b.1.617.2
isn
’
t
as
bad
as
feared
,
the
emergency
is
still
there.the
kind
of
catastrophic
outbreak
like
the
one
in
india
can
cause
many
more
needless
deaths
simply
by
overwhelming
our
resources
.
already

are
reports
that
countries
ranging
from
nepal
to

philippines
to
south

to
nigeria
may
face

shortages
of
the
kind
seen
in

this
pathogen
has
one
fatality
rate
when
oxygen
is
available
as
a
therapy
and
one
when
it
is
not

and
it
would
be
an
unspeakable
tragedy
to
suffer
the
latter
in
the
second
year
of
the

all
pandemics
,
this
one
will
end
either
with

monday
,
india
released
a
new
set
of
numbers
that
showed
the
country
’
s
economy
grew
by
1.6
percent
for
the
three-month
period
ending
in
march
.
but
economists
say
those
numbers
,
which
reflected
activity
before
the
full
impact
of
the
ferocious
second
wave
,
are
most
likely
unsustainable
in
the
current
quarter
,

economists
broadly
predict
growth
during
the
full
fiscal
year
ending
on
march
31
,
2022
,
but
the
pace
is
uncertain.experts
point
to
two
main
reasons
:
india
’
s
prolonged
lockdowns
and
its
vaccination
rate
,
which
has
fallen
to
just
over
a
million
doses
a
day
now
from
about
four
million
last
month
because
of
the
country
’
s
limited
vaccine
manufacturing
capacity.though
the
lockdowns
have
helped
india
slow
the
surge
of
infections
,
economists
say
restrictions
might
need
to
remain
in
place
at
least
until
about
30
percent
of
the
country
’
s
1.4
billion
people
have
received
one
vaccine
shot.
“
we
estimate
that
india
will
reach
the
vaccine
threshold
by
mid-
to
late
august
,
and
,
accordingly
,
expect
restrictions
will
be
extended
into
the
third
quarter

priyanka
kishore
,
the
head
of
india
and
southeast
asia
at
oxford
economics
,
said
in
a
research
briefing
last
week
.
“
consequently
,
we
have
lowered
our
2021
growth
forecast.
”
she
added
that
supply
issues
and
vaccine
hesitancy
could
prevent
the
country
from
reaching
the
30
percent
threshold
by
august
,
which
could
result
in
further
economic
decline.one
economist
said
that
the
economic
hit
would
be
even
more
pronounced
in
rural
areas.
“
as
things
stand
now
,
the
scale
,
the
speed
and
the
spread
of
covid
has
once
again
given
a
push
back
to
the

dr.
sinha
added
that
the
country
’
s
negative
growth
estimates
for
the
previous
financial
year
were
the
lowest
ever
recorded.the
lockdown
that
began
easing
on
monday
was
nowhere
near
as
severe
as
the
nationwide
lockdown
imposed
by
india
’
s
prime

,
last
year

which
pushed
millions
of
people
out

on

transportation
had
been

already
in
danger
of
sliding
out
of
the
middle
class
and
into
poverty
.
the
country
’
s
economy
was
fraying
well
before
the
pandemic
because
of
deep
structural
problems
and
the
sometimes
impetuous
policy
decisions
of
mr.
modi.epidemiologists
in
india
generally
approved
of
the
delhi
government
’
s
approach
to
lifting
its
lockdown
,
but
cautioned
that
the
low
infection
numbers
may
represent
a
reprieve
from
—
and
not
the
end
of
—
the
capital
’
s
terrifying
second
wave.
“
it
’
s
not
a
decision
that
can
be
questioned
on
the
merit
,
but
obviously
they
have
to
take
the
maximum
care

the

state
of
haryana
,

proposed

solution.the
group
said
on
monday
that
it
had
devised
a
less
technical
,
and
more
easily
pronounceable
,
system
for
naming
variants
—
the
mutated
versions
of
the
virus
that
have
driven
new
surges
of
infections
around
the
world.variants
will
be
assigned
letters
of
the

alphabet
in
the
order
in
which
they
are
designated
potential
threats
by

has
contributed
to

deadly
surge

been
named

that
variant
may
spread
even
more
quickly
than
b.1.1.7
,
the
variant
discovered
in

that
has
contributed
to
devastating
waves
of
cases
globally
.
(
b.1.1.7

s
new
name
is
alpha
.
)
scientists
will
keep
assigning
long
strings
of
letters
and
numbers
to
new
variants
for
their
own
purposes
,
but
they
hope
that
greek
letters
will
roll
off
the
tongues
of
nonscientists
more
easily.there
is
also
a
deeper
motivation
:
the
letters-and-numbers
system
was
so
complicated
that
many
people
were
referring
to
variants
by
the
places
they
were
discovered
instead
(
“
the
indian
variant
”
for
b.1.617.2
,
for
example
)
.
scientists
worry
that
those
informal
nicknames
can
be
both
inaccurate
and
stigmatizing
,
punishing
countries
for
investing
in
the
genome
sequencing
necessary
to
sound
an
alarm
about
new
mutations
that
may
well
have
emerged
somewhere
else.whether
the
greek
letters
will
stick
is
another
matter
.
it
has
been
months
since
experts
convened
by
the
w.h.o
.
began
discussing
the
issue
,
allowing
labels
like
“
the
british
variant
”
and
“
the
south
african
variant
”
to
proliferate
in
the
news
media.the
experts
said
they
had
considered
a
number
of
alternatives
,
like
taking
syllables
from
existing
words
to
make
new
words
.
but
too
many
of
those
syllable
combinations
were
already
recognizable
names
of
places
or
businesses
,
they
said.and
as
it
happens
,
the
greek
letters
had
just
been
freed
up
from
another
task
:
the
world
meteorological
organization
said
in

that
it
would
no
longer
use
them
to

once

in

internal
post
,

was
reviewed

an
employee
with
family
in

accused
facebook
of
“
being
afraid
”
that
mr.

would
ban
the
company
from
doing
business
in
the
country
.
“

israelis

palestinians
,
facebook
removed
posts
from
prominent
palestinian
activists
and
briefly
banned
hashtags
related
to
the
violence
.
facebook
employees
again
took
to
the
message
boards
to
ask
why
their
company
now
appeared
to
be
censoring
pro-palestinian
content.
“
it
just
feels
like

once
again

we
are
erring
on
the
side

the

have
grilled
top

meetings
about
the

,
in

case
,
formed
a
group
to
internally
report
palestinian
content
that
they
believe

had
wrongly
removed

this

more

since
mr.
trump
left
office
in
january
,
attention
has
shifted
to
facebook

global

what
employees
said
was
the
company
’

acquiescence
to
governments
so
that
it
could
continue
profiting
in
those
countries.
“

a
feeling
among

“

that
leaves
two
categories

complicated

problematic

process.there

bowdoin

many
other
universities
say
they
plan
to
have
clinics
on
campus
that
will
offer
one
of
the
three
f.d.a.-authorized
vaccines.the
trick
is
that
two
of
those
—
pfizer
and
moderna
—
require
the
first
and
second
dose
to
be
spaced
three
weeks
apart
;
because
someone
is
only
considered
fully
vaccinated
two
weeks
after
the
last
dose
,
the
process
lasts
a
minimum
of
five
weeks
.
during
that
time
,
will
students
be
required
to
quarantine
while
the
rest
of
campus
goes
back
to
normal
?
will
they
need
to
undergo
routine
testing
?
campuses
are
proposing
different
measures
,
with
some
saying
that
those
students
will
need
to
self-isolate
in
their
dorm
and
attend
classes
remotely
.
others
are
saying
the
students
will
be
expected
to
wear
a
mask
and
undergo
testing.the
more
complicated
scenario
is
if
students
received
a
vaccine
that
has
not
been
approved
by
the
w.h.o.
,
like
sputnik
or
covaxin
.
many
colleges
are
proposing
that
those
student
will
need
to
be
revaccinated
,
which
presents
both
medical
and
logistical
conundrums.no
data
exists
on
whether
combining
vaccines
from
different
companies
is
safe.
“
since
covid-19
vaccines
are
not
interchangeable
,
the
safety
and
effectiveness
of
receiving
two
different
covid-19
vaccines
have
not
been
studied

so
little
you
